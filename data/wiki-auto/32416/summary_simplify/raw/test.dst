A valley is a low area between hills or mountains typically with a river running through it.
In geology, a valley or dale is a depression that is longer than it is wide.
Most valleys belong to one of these two main types or a mixture of them, at least with respect to the cross section of the slopes or hillsides.
However, in the lowest stretch of a river, where it approaches its base level, it begins to deposit sediment and the valley bottom becomes a floodplain.
Some of the first human complex societies originated in river valleys, such as that of the Nile, Tigris-Euphrates, Indus, Ganges, Yangtze, Yellow River, Mississippi, and arguably Amazon.
In prehistory, the rivers were used as a source of fresh water and food (fish and game), as well as a place to wash and a sewer.
In Southern England, vales commonly occur between the escarpment slopes of pairs of chalk formations, where the chalk dome has been eroded, exposing less resistant underlying rock, usually claystone.
Rift valleys, such as the Albertine Rift and Gregory Rift are formed by the expansion of the Earth's crust due to tectonic activity beneath the Earth's surface.
There are various forms of valley associated with glaciation that may be referred to as glacial valleys.
A valley carved by glaciers is normally U-shaped and resembles a trough.
This trough valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it.
When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice.
Floor gradient does not affect the valley's shape, it is the glacier's size that does.
Continuously flowing glaciers – especially in the ice age – and large-sized glaciers carve wide, deep incised valleys, sometimes with valley steps that reflect differing erosion rates.
The glaciers carved it out wider and deeper, simultaneously changing the shape.
This proceeds through the glacial erosion processes of glaciation and abrasion, which results in large rocky material (glacial till) being carried in the glacier.
As the ice melts and retreats, the valley is left with very steep sides and a wide, flat floor.
This replaces the original stream or river and is known as a misfit stream because it is smaller than one would expect given the size of its valley.
They served as subglacial drainage pathways carrying large volumes of melt water.
Their cross-sections exhibit steep-sided flanks similar to fjord walls, and their flat bottoms are typical of subglacial glacial erosion.
In northern Central Europe, the Scandinavian ice sheet during the various ice ages advanced slightly uphill against the lie of the land.
As a result, its meltwaters flowed parallel to the ice margin to reach the North Sea basin, forming huge, flat valleys known as "Urstromtäler".
Depending on the topography, the rock types and the climate, a lot of transitional forms between V-, U- and plain valleys exist.
The broader a mountain valley, the lower its shoulders are located in most cases.
An important exception are canyons where the shoulder almost is near the top of the valley's slope.
at the sunny side) because the climate is very mild: even in winter when the valley's floor is completely filled with fog, these villages are in sunshine.
Salzburg) the side valleys are parallel to each other, and additionally they are hanging.
Usually this fact is the result of a violent erosion of the former valley shoulders, a special genesis found also at arêtes and glacial cirques, at every Scottish glen, or in a northern fjord.
They are most commonly associated with U-shaped valleys when a tributary glacier flows into a glacier of larger volume.
The main glacier erodes a deep U-shaped valley with nearly vertical sides while the tributary glacier, with a smaller volume of ice, makes a shallower U-shaped valley.
Since the surfaces of the glaciers were originally at the same elevation, the shallower valley appears to be 'hanging' above the main valley.
Often, waterfalls form at or near the outlet of the upper valley.
Hanging valleys are also simply the product of varying rates of erosion of the main valley and the tributary valleys.
The varying rates of erosion are associated with the composition of the adjacent rocks in the different valley locations.
The tributary valleys are eroded and deepened by glaciers or erosion at a slower rate than that of the main valley floor, thus the difference in the two valleys' depth increases over time.
The tributary valley composed of more resistant rock then hangs over the main valley.
By contrast, with glacial U-shaped valleys, there is less downward and sideways erosion.
The severe slope denudation results in gently sloping valley sides and their transition to the actual valley bottom is unclear.
Side valleys are rather V than U-shaped; near the mouth waterfalls are possible if it is a hanging valley.
The location of the villages depends on the across-valley profile, on climate and local traditions, and on the danger of avalanches or landslides.
Predominant are places on terraces or alluvial fans if they exist.
This term is commonly used in New England, Appalachia, and the Ozarks of Arkansas and Missouri to describe such geographic features.
Appalacian story tellers say that a holler is an area where a person has to holler (yell) to communicate with their nearest neighbor, meaning how deep in the country a person is.
