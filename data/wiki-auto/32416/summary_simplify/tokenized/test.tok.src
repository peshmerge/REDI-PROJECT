[CLS] a valley is a low area between hills or mountains typically with a river running through it . [SEP]
[CLS] in geology , a valley or dale is a depression that is longer than it is wide . [SEP]
[CLS] most valleys belong to one of these two main types or a mixture of them , at least with respect to the cross section of the slopes or hillside ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in the lowest stretch of a river , where it approaches its base level , it begins to deposit sediment and the valley bottom becomes a flood ##pl ##ain . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the first human complex societies originated in river valleys , such as that of the nile , ti ##gr ##is - eu ##ph ##rates , indus , gang ##es , yang ##tze , yellow river , mississippi , and arguably amazon . [SEP]
[CLS] in pre ##his ##tory , the rivers were used as a source of fresh water and food ( fish and game ) , as well as a place to wash and a sewer . [SEP]
[CLS] in southern england , vale ##s commonly occur between the es ##car ##pment slopes of pairs of chalk formations , where the chalk dome has been eroded , exposing less resistant underlying rock , usually clay ##stone . [SEP]
[CLS] rift valleys , such as the albert ##ine rift and gregory rift are formed by the expansion of the earth ' s crust due to te ##cton ##ic activity beneath the earth ' s surface . [SEP]
[CLS] there are various forms of valley associated with g ##la ##ciation that may be referred to as glacial valleys . [SEP]
[CLS] a valley carved by glaciers is normally u - shaped and resembles a trough . [SEP]
[CLS] this trough valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it . [SEP]
[CLS] when the ice rec ##edes or tha ##ws , the valley remains , often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice . [SEP]
[CLS] floor gradient does not affect the valley ' s shape , it is the glacier ' s size that does . [SEP]
[CLS] continuously flowing glaciers – especially in the ice age – and large - sized glaciers car ##ve wide , deep inc ##ised valleys , sometimes with valley steps that reflect differing erosion rates . [SEP]
[CLS] the glaciers carved it out wider and deeper , simultaneously changing the shape . [SEP]
[CLS] this proceeds through the glacial erosion processes of g ##la ##ciation and ab ##ras ##ion , which results in large rocky material ( glacial till ) being carried in the glacier . [SEP]
[CLS] as the ice melt ##s and retreat ##s , the valley is left with very steep sides and a wide , flat floor . [SEP]
[CLS] this replaces the original stream or river and is known as a mis ##fi ##t stream because it is smaller than one would expect given the size of its valley . [SEP]
[CLS] they served as sub ##gl ##ac ##ial drainage pathways carrying large volumes of melt water . [SEP]
[CLS] their cross - sections exhibit steep - sided flanks similar to fjord walls , and their flat bottoms are typical of sub ##gl ##ac ##ial glacial erosion . [SEP]
[CLS] in northern central europe , the scandinavian ice sheet during the various ice ages advanced slightly up ##hill against the lie of the land . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , its melt ##water ##s flowed parallel to the ice margin to reach the north sea basin , forming huge , flat valleys known as " ur ##strom ##tale ##r " . [SEP]
[CLS] depending on the topography , the rock types and the climate , a lot of transitional forms between v - , u - and plain valleys exist . [SEP]
[CLS] the broader a mountain valley , the lower its shoulders are located in most cases . [SEP]
[CLS] an important exception are canyon ##s where the shoulder almost is near the top of the valley ' s slope . [SEP]
[CLS] at the sunny side ) because the climate is very mild : even in winter when the valley ' s floor is completely filled with fog , these villages are in sunshine . [SEP]
[CLS] salzburg ) the side valleys are parallel to each other , and additionally they are hanging . [SEP]
[CLS] usually this fact is the result of a violent erosion of the former valley shoulders , a special genesis found also at are ##tes and glacial ci ##r ##ques , at every scottish glen , or in a northern fjord . [SEP]
[CLS] they are most commonly associated with u - shaped valleys when a tributary glacier flows into a glacier of larger volume . [SEP]
[CLS] the main glacier er ##odes a deep u - shaped valley with nearly vertical sides while the tributary glacier , with a smaller volume of ice , makes a shallow ##er u - shaped valley . [SEP]
[CLS] since the surfaces of the glaciers were originally at the same elevation , the shallow ##er valley appears to be ' hanging ' above the main valley . [SEP]
[CLS] often , waterfalls form at or near the outlet of the upper valley . [SEP]
[CLS] hanging valleys are also simply the product of varying rates of erosion of the main valley and the tributary valleys . [SEP]
[CLS] the varying rates of erosion are associated with the composition of the adjacent rocks in the different valley locations . [SEP]
[CLS] the tributary valleys are eroded and deepened by glaciers or erosion at a slower rate than that of the main valley floor , thus the difference in the two valleys ' depth increases over time . [SEP]
[CLS] the tributary valley composed of more resistant rock then hangs over the main valley . [SEP]
[CLS] by contrast , with glacial u - shaped valleys , there is less downward and sideways erosion . [SEP]
[CLS] the severe slope den ##uda ##tion results in gently sloping valley sides and their transition to the actual valley bottom is unclear . [SEP]
[CLS] side valleys are rather v than u - shaped ; near the mouth waterfalls are possible if it is a hanging valley . [SEP]
[CLS] the location of the villages depends on the across - valley profile , on climate and local traditions , and on the danger of avalanche ##s or landslide ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] predominant are places on terraces or all ##u ##vial fans if they exist . [SEP]
[CLS] this term is commonly used in new england , app ##ala ##chia , and the oz ##ark ##s of arkansas and missouri to describe such geographic features . [SEP]
[CLS] app ##ala ##cian story teller ##s say that a ho ##ller is an area where a person has to ho ##ller ( yell ) to communicate with their nearest neighbor , meaning how deep in the country a person is . [SEP]
