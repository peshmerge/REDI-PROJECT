[CLS] 7 february 1652 ) was a roman catholic priest and italian composer of the roman school and brother of domenico all ##eg ##ri ; he was also a singer . [SEP]
[CLS] here he composed a large number of mo ##tet ##s and other sacred music , which , being brought to the notice of pope urban viii , obtained for him an appointment in the choir of the sis ##tine chapel at rome as a contra ##lto . [SEP]
[CLS] among all ##eg ##ri ' s musical compositions were two volumes of concert ##i for five voices published in 1618 and 161 ##9 ; two volumes of mo ##tet ##s for six voices published in 1621 ; an edition of a four - part sin ##fo ##nia ; five masses ; two settings of the " lame ##ntation ##s of jeremiah " ; and numerous mo ##tet ##s which were not published in his lifetime . [SEP]
[CLS] he was one of the earliest composers for string ##ed instruments , and at ##hana ##sius ki ##rch ##er has given one specimen of this class of his works in his " mu ##sur ##gia " . [SEP]
[CLS] by far the best - known and regarded piece of music composed by all ##eg ##ri is the " mis ##ere ##re mei , de ##us " , a setting of vu ##lga ##te psalm 50 ( = psalm 51 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it is written for two choirs , the one of five and the other of four voices , and has obtained considerable celebrity . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the choirs sings a simple " faux ##bor ##don " based on the original plains ##ong chant for the " ton ##us pere ##grin ##us " ; the other choir sings a similar " faux ##bor ##don " with pre - existing el ##ab ##oration ##s and the use of caden ##za ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the " mis ##ere ##re " has for many years been sung annually during holy week in the sis ##tine chapel . [SEP]
[CLS] the " mis ##ere ##re " is one of the most often - recorded examples of late renaissance music , although it was actually written during the chronological confines of the baroque era ; in this regard it is representative of the music of the roman school of composers , who were stylistic ##ally conservative . [SEP]
[CLS] the work acquired a considerable reputation for mystery and ina ##cc ##ess ##ibility between the time of its composition and the era of modern recording ; the vatican , wanting to preserve its aura of mystery , forbade copies , threatening any publication or attempted copy with ex ##com ##mun ##ication . [SEP]
[CLS] they were not prepared , however , for a special visit in 1770 from a 14 - year - old named wolfgang amadeus mozart , who , on a trip to rome with his father , heard it but twice and transcribed it faithful ##ly from memory , thus creating the first known una ##uth ##oris ##ed copy . [SEP]
[CLS] however , there is evidence that copies of the work that pre - date mozart ' s visit to rome in 1770 had already been circulating in europe , and mozart may have heard the piece performed in london in 1764 or 1765 as well . [SEP]
[CLS] the music itself is rather basic — church music at the time placed a large gap between written and performance practice — em ##bell ##ishment ##s were largely placed in the hands of the performers ' tastes , although the vatican score itself was altered largely by performers and visitors over the years . [SEP]
[CLS] the curious " truck ##er ' s gear change " from g minor to c minor is because the second half of the verse is the same as the first half , but trans ##posed up a fourth . [SEP]
[CLS] the original never had a top c . [SEP]
[CLS] the entire music performed at rome in holy week , all ##eg ##ri ' s " mis ##ere ##re " included , has been issued at leipzig by br ##eit ##ko ##pf and hart ##el . [SEP]
[CLS] interesting accounts of the impression produced by the performance at rome may be found in the first volume of felix men ##del ##sso ##hn ' s letters and in miss taylor ' s " letters from italy " . [SEP]
