Leo VII's election to the papacy was secured by Alberic II of Spoleto, the ruler of Rome at the time.
Leo was the priest of the church of St. Sixtus in Rome, thought to be a Benedictine monk.
He had little ambition towards the papacy, but consented under pressure.
Most of his bulls were grants of privilege to monasteries, especially including the Abbey of Cluny.
"Pope Leo VII"] Leo called for Odo of Cluny to mediate between Alberic and Hugh of Italy, Alberic's stepfather, the King of Italy.
Leo allowed Frederick to drive out Jews that refused to be baptized, but he did not endorse the forced baptism of Jews.
After his death in July 939, Leo VII was interred at St. Peter's Basilica.
