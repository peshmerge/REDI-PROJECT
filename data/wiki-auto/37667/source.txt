Pope Leo VII ( ; died 13 July 939) was Pope from 3 January 936 to his death in 939.
He was preceded by Pope John XI and followed by Pope Stephen VIII.
Leo VII's election to the papacy was secured by Alberic II of Spoleto, the ruler of Rome at the time.
Alberic wanted to choose the pope so that the papacy would continue to yield to his authority.
Leo was the priest of the church of St. Sixtus in Rome, thought to be a Benedictine monk.
He had little ambition towards the papacy, but consented under pressure.
As pope, Leo VII reigned for only three years.
Most of his bulls were grants of privilege to monasteries, especially including the Abbey of Cluny.
"Pope Leo VII"] Leo called for Odo of Cluny to mediate between Alberic and Hugh of Italy, Alberic's stepfather, the King of Italy.
Odo was successful in negotiating a truce after arranging a marriage between Hugh's daughter Alda and Alberic.
Leo VII also appointed Frederick, Archbishop of Mainz, as a reformer in Germany.
Leo allowed Frederick to drive out Jews that refused to be baptized, but he did not endorse the forced baptism of Jews.
After his death in July 939, Leo VII was interred at St. Peter's Basilica.
