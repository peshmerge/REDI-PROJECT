[CLS] macro ##ev ##ol ##ution is evolution on a scale at or above the level of species , in contrast with micro ##ev ##ol ##ution , which refers to smaller evolutionary changes of all ##ele frequencies within a species or population . [SEP]
[CLS] macro ##ev ##ol ##ution and micro ##ev ##ol ##ution describe fundamentally identical processes on different scales . [SEP]
[CLS] the process of spec ##iation may fall within the pu ##r ##view of either , depending on the forces thought to drive it . [SEP]
[CLS] pale ##ont ##ology , evolutionary developmental biology , comparative gen ##omics and gen ##omic ph ##yl ##ost ##rat ##igraphy contribute most of the evidence for macro ##ev ##ol ##ution ' s patterns and processes . [SEP]
[CLS] russian en ##tom ##ologist yuri fi ##lip ##chenko first coined the terms " macro ##ev ##ol ##ution " and " micro ##ev ##ol ##ution " in 1927 in his german language work , " var ##ia ##bil ##ita ##t und variation " . [SEP]
[CLS] since the inception of the two terms , their meanings have been revised several times . [SEP]
[CLS] the term macro ##ev ##ol ##ution fell into a certain di ##sf ##av ##our when it was taken over by writers such as the pale ##ont ##ologist otto sc ##hin ##de ##wo ##lf to describe their theories of or ##th ##ogen ##esis . [SEP]
[CLS] this was the vital ##ist belief that organisms evolve in a definite direction due to an internal " driving force " . [SEP]
[CLS] macro ##ev ##ol ##ution includes changes occurring on geological time scales , in contrast to micro ##ev ##ol ##ution , which occurs on any time scale . [SEP]
[CLS] within the modern synthesis of the early 20th century , macro ##ev ##ol ##ution is thought of as the compound ##ed effects of micro ##ev ##ol ##ution . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the distinction between micro - and macro ##ev ##ol ##ution is not a fundamental one – the only difference between them is of time and scale . [SEP]
[CLS] as ernst w . may ##r observes , " trans ##sp ##ec ##ific evolution is nothing but an extra ##pol ##ation and mag ##ni ##fication of the events that take place within populations and species . . . it is misleading to make a distinction between the causes of micro - and macro ##ev ##ol ##ution " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , time is not a necessary distinguishing factor ##mac ##ro ##ev ##ol ##ution can happen without gradual compound ##ing of small changes ; whole - genome du ##plication can result in spec ##iation occurring over a single generation – this is especially common in plants . [SEP]
[CLS] changes in the genes regulating development have also been proposed as being important in producing spec ##iation through large and relatively sudden changes in animals ' morphology . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many ways to view macro ##ev ##ol ##ution , for example , by observing changes in the genetics , morphology , taxonomy , ecology , and behavior of organisms , though these are inter ##rel ##ated . [SEP]
[CLS] sa ##hn ##ey et al . stated the connection as " as taxonomic diversity has increased , there have been incentives for te ##tra ##pods to move into new modes of life , where initially resources may seem unlimited , there are few competitors and possible refuge from danger . [SEP]
[CLS] and as ecological diversity increases , taxa divers ##ify from their ancestors at a much greater rate among fauna ##s with more superior , innovative or more flexible adaptations . " [SEP]
[CLS] molecular evolution occurs through small changes in the molecular or cellular level . [SEP]
[CLS] over a long period of time , this can cause big effects on the genetics of organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] taxonomic evolution occurs through small changes between populations and then species . [SEP]
[CLS] over a long period of time , this can cause big effects on the taxonomy of organisms , with the growth of whole new clade ##s above the species level . [SEP]
[CLS] morphological evolution occurs through small changes in the morphology of an organism . [SEP]
[CLS] over a long period of time , this can cause big effects on the morphology of major clade ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this can be clearly seen in the ce ##ta ##cea , where throughout the group ' s early evolution , hind ##lim ##bs were still present . [SEP]
[CLS] however over millions of years the hind ##lim ##bs reg ##ressed and became internal . [SEP]
[CLS] abrupt transformations from one bio ##logic system to another , for example the passing of life from water into land or the transition from invertebrates to ve ##rte ##brates , are rare . [SEP]
[CLS] few major biological types have emerged during the evolutionary history of life . [SEP]
[CLS] when life ##forms take such giant leaps , they meet little to no competition and are able to exploit many available niche ##s , following an adaptive radiation . [SEP]
[CLS] this can lead to converge ##nt evolution as the empty niche ##s are filled by whichever life ##form encounters them . [SEP]
