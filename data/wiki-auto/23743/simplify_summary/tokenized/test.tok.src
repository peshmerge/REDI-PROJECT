[CLS] the ph ##ane ##ro ##zo ##ic e ##on is the current geologic e ##on in the geologic time scale , and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed . [SEP]
[CLS] it covers round 5 million years to the present , and began with the cambrian period when animals first developed hard shells preserved in the fossil record . [SEP]
[CLS] its name was derived from the ancient greek words and , meaning " visible life " , since it was once believed that life began in the cambrian , the first period of this e ##on . [SEP]

[CLS] the time before the ph ##ane ##ro ##zo ##ic , called the " pre ##cam ##bria ##n " , is now divided into the had ##ean , arch ##aea ##n and pro ##ter ##oz ##oic e ##ons . [SEP]
[CLS] the time span of the ph ##ane ##ro ##zo ##ic starts with the sudden appearance of fossil ##ized evidence of a number of animal ph ##yla ; the evolution of those ph ##yla into diverse forms ; the emergence and development of complex plants ; the evolution of fish ; the emergence of insects and te ##tra ##pods ; and the development of modern fauna . [SEP]
[CLS] plant life on land appeared in the early ph ##ane ##ro ##zo ##ic e ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] during this time span , te ##cton ##ic forces caused the continents to move and eventually collect into a single land ##mas ##s known as pang ##aea ( the most recent super ##con ##tine ##nt ) , which then separated into the current continental land ##mas ##ses . [SEP]
