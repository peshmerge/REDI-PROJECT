The Phanerozoic Eon is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale, and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed.
It covers round 5 million years to the present, and began with the Cambrian Period when animals first developed hard shells preserved in the fossil record.
Its name was derived from the Ancient Greek words and , meaning "visible life", since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon.
The term "Phanerozoic" was coined in 1930 by the American geologist George Halcott Chadwick (1876â€“1953).
The time before the Phanerozoic, called the "Precambrian", is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons.
The time span of the Phanerozoic starts with the sudden appearance of fossilized evidence of a number of animal phyla; the evolution of those phyla into diverse forms; the emergence and development of complex plants; the evolution of fish; the emergence of insects and tetrapods; and the development of modern fauna.
Plant life on land appeared in the early Phanerozoic eon.
During this time span, tectonic forces caused the continents to move and eventually collect into a single landmass known as Pangaea (the most recent supercontinent), which then separated into the current continental landmasses.
