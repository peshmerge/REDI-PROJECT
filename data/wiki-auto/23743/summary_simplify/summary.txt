The Phanerozoic Eon is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale, and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed.
It covers round 5 million years to the present, and began with the Cambrian Period when animals first developed hard shells preserved in the fossil record.
Its name was derived from the Ancient Greek words and , meaning "visible life", since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon.
The time before the Phanerozoic, called the "Precambrian", is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons.
The time span of the Phanerozoic starts with the sudden appearance of fossilized evidence of a number of animal phyla; the evolution of those phyla into diverse forms; the emergence and development of complex plants; the evolution of fish; the emergence of insects and tetrapods; and the development of modern fauna.
