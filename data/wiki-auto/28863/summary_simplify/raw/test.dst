The Sea of Marmara ( ; ), also known as the Sea of Marmora or the Marmara Sea, and in the context of classical antiquity as the Propontis is the inland sea, entirely within the borders of Turkey, that connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, thus separating Turkey's Asian and European parts.
The Bosphorus strait connects it to the Black Sea and the Dardanelles strait to the Aegean Sea.
In Greek mythology, a storm on Propontis brought the Argonauts back to an island they had left, precipitating a battle where either Jason or Heracles killed King Cyzicus, who mistook them for his Pelasgian enemies.
The surface salinity of the sea averages about 22 parts per thousand, which is slightly greater than that of the Black Sea, but only about two-thirds that of most oceans.
The water is much more saline at the sea bottom, averaging salinities of around 38 parts per thousand, similar to that of the Mediterranean Sea.
This high-density saline water, like that of the Black Sea, does not migrate to the surface.
Water from the Susurluk, Biga (Granicus) and Gonen Rivers also reduces the salinity of the sea, though with less influence than on the Black Sea.
During a storm on December 29, 1999, the Russian oil tanker "Volgoneft" broke in two in the Sea of Marmara, and more than 1,500 tonnes of oil were spilled into the water.
The North Anatolian Fault, which has triggered many major earthquakes in recent years, such as the August and November 1999 earthquakes in Izmit and DuÌˆzce, respectively, runs under the sea.
