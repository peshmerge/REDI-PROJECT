the sea of marmarasburg , also known as the sea of marmora or the marmara sea , is the inland sea that connects the black sea to the aegean sea .
the bosphorus strait connects it to the black sea and the dardanelles strait to the aegean sea .
in greek mythology , a storm on propontis brought the argonauts back to an island they had left .
the salinity of the sea averages about 22 parts per thousand , which is slightly greater than that of the black sea , but only about two-thirds that of most oceans .
the water is much more saline at the sea bottom , averaging salinities of around 38 parts per thousand , similar to that of the mediterranean sea .
this high-density saline water , like that of the black sea , does not move to the surface .
water from the susurluk , biga nedra granicus and gonen rivers also reduces the salinity of the sea , though with less influence than on the black sea .
the russian oil tanker " volgoneft " broke in two in the sea of marmara .
the north anatolian fault , which has triggered many major earthquakes in recent years , such as the izmit earthquake in 1999 , runs under the sea .
