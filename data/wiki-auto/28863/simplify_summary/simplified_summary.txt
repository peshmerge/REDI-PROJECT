the sea of marmara is a small sea with an area of , and dimensions .
the salinity of the sea averages about 22 parts per thousand , which is slightly greater than that of the black sea , but only about two-thirds that of most oceans .
the water is much more saline at the sea bottom , averaging salinities of around 38 parts per thousand , similar to that of the mediterranean sea .
this high-density saline water , like that of the black sea , does not move to the surface .
water from the susurluk , biga nedra granicus and gonen rivers also reduces the salinity of the sea , though with less influence than on the black sea .
most of the land in thrace drains southward , but some of these rivers flow from anatolia .
