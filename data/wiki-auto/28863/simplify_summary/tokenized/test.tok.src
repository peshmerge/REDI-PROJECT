[CLS] the water is much more saline at the sea bottom , averaging sal ##ini ##ties of around 38 parts per thousand , similar to that of the mediterranean sea . [SEP]
[CLS] this high - density saline water , like that of the black sea , does not migrate to the surface . [SEP]
[CLS] water from the su ##sur ##lu ##k , big ##a ( gran ##icus ) and gone ##n rivers also reduces the sal ##ini ##ty of the sea , though with less influence than on the black sea . [SEP]
[CLS] with little land in th ##race draining southward , almost all of these rivers flow from anatolia . [SEP]
