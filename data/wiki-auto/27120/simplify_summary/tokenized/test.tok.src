[CLS] the so ##rb ##ian languages are two closely related , but only partially mutually intel ##li ##gible , west slavic languages spoken by the so ##rb ##s , a west slavic minority in the lu ##sat ##ia region of eastern germany . [SEP]
[CLS] they are classified under the west slavic branch of the indo - european languages and are therefore closely related to the other two west slavic subgroup ##s : le ##chi ##tic and czech â€“ slovak . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , the languages have also been known as wen ##dis ##h ( named after the wen ##ds , earliest slavic people in modern poland and germany ) or lu ##sat ##ian . [SEP]

[CLS] the area where the two languages are spoken is known as lu ##sat ##ia ( in upper so ##rb ##ian , in lower so ##rb ##ian , or in german ) . [SEP]
[CLS] after the settlement of the formerly germanic territories ( the part largely corresponding to the former east germany ) by the so ##rb ##s ' slavic ancestors in the fifth and sixth centuries , the so ##rb ##ian language ( or its predecessors ) had been in use in much of what was the southern half of east germany for several centuries , and still had its stronghold in ( upper and lower ) lu ##sat ##ia , where it enjoys national protection and foster ##ing to the present day . [SEP]
[CLS] outside lu ##sat ##ia , it has been superseded by german . [SEP]
[CLS] from the 13th century on , the language suffered official discrimination . [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] both upper and lower so ##rb ##ian have the dual for nouns , pronouns , adjective ##s , and verbs ; very few living indo - european languages retain this as a productive feature of the grammar . [SEP]
