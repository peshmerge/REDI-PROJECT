By extension, the term "yellow journalism" is used today as a pejorative to decry any journalism that treats news in an unprofessional or unethical fashion.
In the UK, a roughly equivalent term is "tabloid journalism", meaning journalism characteristic of tabloid newspapers, even if found elsewhere.
In the U.S. it is generally considered unethical, with most mainstream newspapers and news shows having a policy forbidding it.
In contrast, tabloid newspapers and tabloid television shows, which rely more on sensationalism, regularly engage in the practice.
The term was extensively used to describe certain major New York City newspapers around 1900 as they battled for circulation.
The term was coined in the mid-1890s to characterize the sensational journalism in the circulation war between Joseph Pulitzer's "New York World" and William Randolph Hearst's "New York Journal".
Both papers were accused by critics of sensationalizing the news in order to drive up circulation, although the newspapers did serious reporting as well.
Wardman was the first to publish the term but there is evidence that expressions such as "yellow journalism" and "school of yellow kid journalism" were already used by newsmen of that time.
Pulitzer strove to make the "New York World" an entertaining read, and filled his paper with pictures, games and contests that drew in new readers.
In addition, Pulitzer only charged readers two cents per issue but gave readers eight and sometimes 12 pages of information (the only other two cent paper in the city never exceeded four pages).
Pulitzer believed that newspapers were public institutions with a duty to improve society, and he put the "World" in the service of social reform.
Just two years after Pulitzer took it over, the "World" became the highest circulation newspaper in New York, aided in part by its strong ties to the Democratic Party.
Older publishers, envious of Pulitzer's success, began criticizing the "World", harping on its crime stories and stunts while ignoring its more serious reporting — trends which influenced the popular perception of yellow journalism.
Pulitzer's approach made an impression on William Randolph Hearst, a mining heir who acquired the "San Francisco Examiner" from his father in 1887.
In one well remembered story, "Examiner" reporter Winifred Black was admitted into a San Francisco hospital and discovered that indigent women were treated with "gross cruelty."
With the success of the "Examiner" established by the early 1890s, Hearst began looking for a New York newspaper to purchase, and acquired the "New York Journal" in 1895, a penny paper which Pulitzer's brother Albert had sold to a Cincinnati publisher the year before.
This drove Hearst; following Pulitzer's earlier strategy, he kept the "Journal's" price at one cent (compared to "The World's" two cent price) while providing as much information as rival newspapers.
While most sources say that Hearst simply offered more money, Pulitzer — who had grown increasingly abusive to his employees — had become an extremely difficult man to work for, and many "World" employees were willing to jump for the sake of getting away from him.
Both were Democratic, both were sympathetic to labor and immigrants (a sharp contrast to publishers like the "New York Tribune's "Whitelaw Reid, who blamed their poverty on moral defects), and both invested enormous resources in their Sunday publications, which functioned like weekly magazines, going beyond the normal scope of daily journalism.
Their Sunday entertainment features included the first color comic strip pages, and some theorize that the term yellow journalism originated there, while as noted above, the "New York Press" left the term it invented undefined.
The use of "yellow journalism" as a synonym for over-the-top sensationalism in the U.S. apparently started with more serious newspapers commenting on the excesses of "the Yellow Kid papers."
In 1890, Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis published "The Right to Privacy", considered the most influential of all law review articles, as a critical response to sensational forms of journalism, which they saw as an unprecedented threat to individual privacy.
The article is widely considered to have led to the recognition of new common law privacy rights of action.
Pulitzer and Hearst are often adduced as the cause of the United States' entry into the Spanish–American War due to sensationalist stories or exaggerations of the terrible conditions in Cuba.
However, the vast majority of Americans did not live in New York City, and the decision-makers who did live there probably relied more on staid newspapers like the "Times", "The Sun", or the "Post".
James Creelman wrote an anecdote in his memoir that artist Frederic Remington telegrammed Hearst to tell him all was quiet in Cuba and "There will be no war."
While the accounts were of dubious accuracy, the newspaper readers of the 19th century did not expect, or necessarily want, his stories to be pure nonfiction.
Historian Michael Robertson has said that "Newspaper reporters and readers of the 1890s were much less concerned with distinguishing among fact-based reporting, opinion and literature."
The yellow press covered the revolution extensively and often inaccurately, but conditions on Cuba were horrific enough.
The island was in a terrible economic depression, and Spanish general Valeriano Weyler, sent to crush the rebellion, herded Cuban peasants into concentration camps, leading hundreds of Cubans to their deaths.
Having clamored for a fight for two years, Hearst took credit for the conflict when it came: A week after the United States declared war on Spain, he ran "How do you like the "Journal's" war?"
Moreover, journalism historians have noted that yellow journalism was largely confined to New York City, and that newspapers in the rest of the country did not follow their lead.
The "Journal" and the "World" were not among the top ten sources of news in regional papers, and the stories simply did not make a splash outside New York City.
These factors weighed more on the president's mind than the melodramas in the "New York Journal."
When the invasion began, Hearst sailed directly to Cuba as a war correspondent, providing sober and accurate accounts of the fighting.
Creelman later praised the work of the reporters for exposing the horrors of Spanish misrule, arguing, "no true history of the war ... can be written without an acknowledgment that whatever of justice and freedom and progress was accomplished by the Spanish–American War was due to the enterprise and tenacity of "yellow journalists," many of whom lie in unremembered graves."
He later ran for mayor and governor and even sought the presidential nomination, but lost much of his personal prestige when outrage exploded in 1901 after columnist Ambrose Bierce and editor Arthur Brisbane published separate columns months apart that suggested the assassination of William McKinley.
When McKinley was shot on September 6, 1901, critics accused Hearst's Yellow Journalism of driving Leon Czolgosz to the deed.
Hearst did not know of Bierce's column, and claimed to have pulled Brisbane's after it ran in a first edition, but the incident would haunt him for the rest of his life, and all but destroyed his presidential ambitions.
Pulitzer, haunted by his "yellow sins," returned the "World" to its crusading roots as the new century dawned.
By the time of his death in 1911, the "World" was a widely respected publication, and would remain a leading progressive paper until its demise in 1931.
Its name lived on in the Scripps-Howard "New York World-Telegram", and then later the "New York World-Telegram and Sun" in 1950, and finally was last used by the "New York World-Journal-Tribune" from September 1966 to May 1967.
