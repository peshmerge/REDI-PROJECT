[CLS] yellow journalism and the yellow press are american terms for journalism and associated newspapers that present little or no legitimate well - researched news while instead using eye - catching headlines for increased sales . [SEP]
[CLS] techniques may include ex ##agger ##ations of news events , scandal - mon ##ger ##ing , or sensation ##alis ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] by extension , the term " yellow journalism " is used today as a pe ##jo ##rative to dec ##ry any journalism that treats news in an un ##pro ##fe ##ssion ##al or une ##thic ##al fashion . [SEP]
[CLS] in english , the term is chiefly used in the us . [SEP]
[CLS] in the uk , a roughly equivalent term is " tabloid journalism " , meaning journalism characteristic of tabloid newspapers , even if found elsewhere . [SEP]
[CLS] other languages , e . g . russian , sometimes have terms derived from the american term . [SEP]
[CLS] a common source of such writing is called check ##book journalism , which is the controversial practice of news reporters paying sources for their information without verify ##ing its truth or accuracy . [SEP]
[CLS] in the u . s . it is generally considered une ##thic ##al , with most mainstream newspapers and news shows having a policy forbid ##ding it . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , tabloid newspapers and tabloid television shows , which rely more on sensation ##alis ##m , regularly engage in the practice . [SEP]
[CLS] joseph campbell describes yellow press newspapers as having daily multi - column front - page headlines covering a variety of topics , such as sports and scandal , using bold layout ##s ( with large illustrations and perhaps color ) , heavy reliance on unnamed sources , and una ##bas ##hed self - promotion . [SEP]
[CLS] the term was extensively used to describe certain major new york city newspapers around 1900 as they battled for circulation . [SEP]
[CLS] the term was coined in the mid - 1890s to character ##ize the sensation ##al journalism in the circulation war between joseph pulitzer ' s " new york world " and william randolph hearst ' s " new york journal " . [SEP]
[CLS] the battle peaked from 1895 to about 1898 , and historical usage often refers specifically to this period . [SEP]
[CLS] both papers were accused by critics of sensation ##ali ##zing the news in order to drive up circulation , although the newspapers did serious reporting as well . [SEP]
[CLS] an english magazine in 1898 noted , " all american journalism is not ' yellow ' , though all strictly ' up - to - date ' yellow journalism is american ! " [SEP]
[CLS] the term was coined by erwin ward ##man , the editor of the " new york press " . [SEP]
[CLS] ward ##man was the first to publish the term but there is evidence that expressions such as " yellow journalism " and " school of yellow kid journalism " were already used by news ##men of that time . [SEP]
[CLS] ward ##man never defined the term exactly . [SEP]
[CLS] possibly it was a mutation from earlier sl ##ander where ward ##man twisted " new journalism " into " nude journalism " . [SEP]
[CLS] ward ##man had also used the expression " yellow kid journalism " referring to the then - popular comic strip which was published by both pulitzer and hearst during a circulation war . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1898 the paper simply elaborated : " we called them yellow because they are yellow . " [SEP]
[CLS] joseph pulitzer purchased the " new york world " in 1883 after making the " st . louis post - dispatch " the dominant daily in that city . [SEP]
[CLS] pulitzer st ##rove to make the " new york world " an entertaining read , and filled his paper with pictures , games and contests that drew in new readers . [SEP]
[CLS] crime stories filled many of the pages , with headlines like " was he a suicide ? " [SEP]
[CLS] and " screaming for mercy . " [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , pulitzer only charged readers two cents per issue but gave readers eight and sometimes 12 pages of information ( the only other two cent paper in the city never exceeded four pages ) . [SEP]
[CLS] while there were many sensation ##al stories in the " new york world " , they were by no means the only pieces , or even the dominant ones . [SEP]
[CLS] pulitzer believed that newspapers were public institutions with a duty to improve society , and he put the " world " in the service of social reform . [SEP]
[CLS] just two years after pulitzer took it over , the " world " became the highest circulation newspaper in new york , aided in part by its strong ties to the democratic party . [SEP]
[CLS] older publishers , en ##vious of pulitzer ' s success , began criticizing the " world " , harp ##ing on its crime stories and stunts while ignoring its more serious reporting — trends which influenced the popular perception of yellow journalism . [SEP]
[CLS] charles dana , editor of the " new york sun " , attacked " the world " and said pulitzer was " def ##icient in judgment and in staying power . " [SEP]
[CLS] pulitzer ' s approach made an impression on william randolph hearst , a mining heir who acquired the " san francisco examiner " from his father in 1887 . [SEP]
[CLS] hearst read the " world " while studying at harvard university and resolved to make the " examiner " as bright as pulitzer ' s paper . [SEP]
[CLS] hearst could be hyper ##bolic in his crime coverage ; one of his early pieces , regarding a " band of murderers , " attacked the police for forcing " examiner " reporters to do their work for them . [SEP]
[CLS] but while ind ##ul ##ging in these stunts , the " examiner " also increased its space for international news , and sent reporters out to uncover municipal corruption and in ##ef ##fi ##ciency . [SEP]
[CLS] in one well remembered story , " examiner " reporter win ##if ##red black was admitted into a san francisco hospital and discovered that ind ##igen ##t women were treated with " gross cruelty . " [SEP]
[CLS] the entire hospital staff was fired the morning the piece appeared . [SEP]
[CLS] with the success of the " examiner " established by the early 1890s , hearst began looking for a new york newspaper to purchase , and acquired the " new york journal " in 1895 , a penny paper which pulitzer ' s brother albert had sold to a cincinnati publisher the year before . [SEP]
[CLS] metropolitan newspapers started going after department store advertising in the 1890s , and discovered the larger the circulation base , the better . [SEP]
[CLS] this drove hearst ; following pulitzer ' s earlier strategy , he kept the " journal ' s " price at one cent ( compared to " the world ' s " two cent price ) while providing as much information as rival newspapers . [SEP]
[CLS] the approach worked , and as the " journal ' s " circulation jumped to 150 , 000 , pulitzer cut his price to a penny , hoping to drive his young competitor ( who was sub ##si ##di ##zed by his family ' s fortune ) into bankruptcy . [SEP]
[CLS] in a counterattack , hearst raided the staff of the " world " in 1896 . [SEP]
[CLS] while most sources say that hearst simply offered more money , pulitzer — who had grown increasingly abusive to his employees — had become an extremely difficult man to work for , and many " world " employees were willing to jump for the sake of getting away from him . [SEP]
[CLS] although the competition between the " world " and the " journal " was fierce , the papers were temperament ##ally alike . [SEP]
[CLS] both were democratic , both were sympathetic to labor and immigrants ( a sharp contrast to publishers like the " new york tribune ' s " white ##law reid , who blamed their poverty on moral defects ) , and both invested enormous resources in their sunday publications , which functioned like weekly magazines , going beyond the normal scope of daily journalism . [SEP]
[CLS] their sunday entertainment features included the first color comic strip pages , and some theo ##rize that the term yellow journalism originated there , while as noted above , the " new york press " left the term it invented und ##efined . [SEP]
[CLS] " hogan ' s alley , " a comic strip revolving around a bald child in a yellow nights ##hir ##t ( nicknamed the yellow kid ) , became exceptionally popular when cartoonist richard f . out ##ca ##ult began drawing it in the " world " in early 1896 . [SEP]
[CLS] when hearst predict ##ably hired out ##ca ##ult away , pulitzer asked artist george lu ##ks to continue the strip with his characters , giving the city two yellow kids . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of " yellow journalism " as a synonym for over - the - top sensation ##alis ##m in the u . s . apparently started with more serious newspapers commenting on the excess ##es of " the yellow kid papers . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1890 , samuel warren and louis brand ##eis published " the right to privacy " , considered the most influential of all law review articles , as a critical response to sensation ##al forms of journalism , which they saw as an unprecedented threat to individual privacy . [SEP]
[CLS] the article is widely considered to have led to the recognition of new common law privacy rights of action . [SEP]
[CLS] pulitzer and hearst are often add ##uce ##d as the cause of the united states ' entry into the spanish – american war due to sensation ##alis ##t stories or ex ##agger ##ations of the terrible conditions in cuba . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the vast majority of americans did not live in new york city , and the decision - makers who did live there probably relied more on st ##aid newspapers like the " times " , " the sun " , or the " post " . [SEP]
[CLS] james cree ##lman wrote an an ##ec ##dote in his memoir that artist frederic remington telegram ##med hearst to tell him all was quiet in cuba and " there will be no war . " [SEP]
[CLS] cree ##lman claimed hearst responded " please remain . [SEP]
[CLS] you fur ##nish the pictures and i ' ll fur ##nish the war . " [SEP]
[CLS] hearst denied the vera ##city of the story , and no one has found any evidence of the telegram ##s existing . [SEP]
[CLS] hearst became a war hawk after a rebellion broke out in cuba in 1895 . [SEP]
[CLS] stories of cuban virtue and spanish brutality soon dominated his front page . [SEP]
[CLS] while the accounts were of dubious accuracy , the newspaper readers of the 19th century did not expect , or necessarily want , his stories to be pure nonfiction . [SEP]
[CLS] historian michael robertson has said that " newspaper reporters and readers of the 1890s were much less concerned with distinguishing among fact - based reporting , opinion and literature . " [SEP]
[CLS] pulitzer , though lacking hearst ' s resources , kept the story on his front page . [SEP]
[CLS] the yellow press covered the revolution extensively and often inaccurate ##ly , but conditions on cuba were horrific enough . [SEP]
[CLS] the island was in a terrible economic depression , and spanish general vale ##rian ##o we ##yler , sent to crush the rebellion , herd ##ed cuban peasants into concentration camps , leading hundreds of cuban ##s to their deaths . [SEP]
[CLS] having cl ##amo ##red for a fight for two years , hearst took credit for the conflict when it came : a week after the united states declared war on spain , he ran " how do you like the " journal ' s " war ? " [SEP]
[CLS] on his front page . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , president william mckinley never read the " journal " , nor newspapers like the " tribune " and the " new york evening post " . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , journalism historians have noted that yellow journalism was largely confined to new york city , and that newspapers in the rest of the country did not follow their lead . [SEP]
[CLS] the " journal " and the " world " were not among the top ten sources of news in regional papers , and the stories simply did not make a splash outside new york city . [SEP]
[CLS] rather , war came because public opinion was sick ##ened by the blood ##shed , and because leaders like mckinley realized that spain had lost control of cuba . [SEP]
[CLS] these factors weighed more on the president ' s mind than the mel ##od ##rama ##s in the " new york journal . " [SEP]
[CLS] when the invasion began , hearst sailed directly to cuba as a war correspondent , providing sober and accurate accounts of the fighting . [SEP]
[CLS] cree ##lman later praised the work of the reporters for exposing the horrors of spanish mis ##ru ##le , arguing , " no true history of the war . . . can be written without an ac ##k ##now ##led ##gm ##ent that whatever of justice and freedom and progress was accomplished by the spanish – american war was due to the enterprise and ten ##ac ##ity of " yellow journalists , " many of whom lie in un ##rem ##em ##bered graves . " [SEP]
[CLS] hearst was a leading democrat who promoted william jennings bryan for president in 1896 and 1900 . [SEP]
[CLS] he later ran for mayor and governor and even sought the presidential nomination , but lost much of his personal prestige when outrage exploded in 1901 after columnist ambrose bi ##er ##ce and editor arthur brisbane published separate columns months apart that suggested the assassination of william mckinley . [SEP]
[CLS] when mckinley was shot on september 6 , 1901 , critics accused hearst ' s yellow journalism of driving leon c ##zo ##l ##gos ##z to the deed . [SEP]
[CLS] hearst did not know of bi ##er ##ce ' s column , and claimed to have pulled brisbane ' s after it ran in a first edition , but the incident would haunt him for the rest of his life , and all but destroyed his presidential ambitions . [SEP]
[CLS] pulitzer , haunted by his " yellow sins , " returned the " world " to its cr ##usa ##ding roots as the new century dawned . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time of his death in 1911 , the " world " was a widely respected publication , and would remain a leading progressive paper until its demise in 1931 . [SEP]
[CLS] its name lived on in the sc ##rip ##ps - howard " new york world - telegram " , and then later the " new york world - telegram and sun " in 1950 , and finally was last used by the " new york world - journal - tribune " from september 1966 to may 1967 . [SEP]
[CLS] at that point , only one broad ##sh ##eet newspaper was left in new york city . [SEP]
