Southcentral Alaska is the portion of the U.S. state of Alaska consisting of the shorelines and uplands of the central Gulf of Alaska.
Most of the population of the state lives in this region, concentrated in and around the city of Anchorage.
The area includes Cook Inlet, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, the Kenai Peninsula, Prince William Sound, and the Copper River Valley.
Tourism, fisheries, and petroleum production are important economic activities.
The hours of daylight per day varies from 20 hours in June and July to 6 hours in December and January.
The coastal areas consist of temperate rainforests and alder shrublands.
The Cook Inlet volcanoes, located in the Tordrillo Mountains and in the north end of the Aleutian Range, are newer, lie in the West, and include Mount Redoubt, Mount Iliamna, Hayes Volcano, Mount Augustine, Fourpeaked Mountain and Mount Spurr.
Most recently, Augustine and Fourpeaked erupted in 2006, and Mount Redoubt erupted in March 2009, resulting in airplane flight cancellations.
