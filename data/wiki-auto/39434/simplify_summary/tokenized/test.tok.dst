[CLS] sir charles antony richard ho ##are ( born 11 january 1934 ) , is a british computer scientist . [SEP]
[CLS] he developed the sorting algorithm quick ##sor ##t in 1959 / 1960 . [SEP]
[CLS] he also developed ho ##are logic for verify ##ing program correct ##ness , and the formal language communicating sequential processes ( cs ##p ) to specify the interactions of concurrent processes ( including the dining philosophers problem ) and the inspiration for the o ##cca ##m programming language . [SEP]
[CLS] born in colombo , ceylon ( now sri lanka ) to british parents , tony ho ##are ' s father was a colonial civil servant and his mother was the daughter of a tea plant ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] ho ##are was educated in england at the dragon school in oxford and the king ' s school in canterbury . [SEP]

[CLS] he became the professor of computing science at the queen ' s university of belfast in 1968 , and in 1977 returned to oxford as the professor of computing to lead the programming research group in the oxford university computing laboratory ( now department of computer science , university of oxford ) , following the death of christopher st ##rac ##hey . [SEP]
[CLS] he is now an emeritus professor there , and is also a principal researcher at microsoft research in cambridge , england . [SEP]
[CLS] ho ##are ' s most significant work has been in the following areas : his sorting and selection algorithm ( quick ##sor ##t and quick ##sel ##ect ) , ho ##are logic , the formal language communicating sequential processes ( cs ##p ) used to specify the interactions between concurrent processes , st ##ru ##cturing computer operating systems using the monitor concept , and the ax ##iom ##atic specification of programming languages . [SEP]
[CLS] for many years under his leadership his oxford department worked on formal specification languages such as cs ##p and z . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1962 , ho ##are married jill p ##ym , a member of his research team . [SEP]
