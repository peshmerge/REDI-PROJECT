Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare (born 11 January 1934), is a British computer scientist.
He developed the sorting algorithm quicksort in 1959/1960.
He also developed Hoare logic for verifying program correctness, and the formal language communicating sequential processes (CSP) to specify the interactions of concurrent processes (including the dining philosophers problem) and the inspiration for the occam programming language.
Born in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to British parents, Tony Hoare's father was a colonial civil servant and his mother was the daughter of a tea planter.
Hoare was educated in England at the Dragon School in Oxford and the King's School in Canterbury.
He then studied Classics and Philosophy ("Greats") at Merton College, Oxford.
On graduating in 1956 he did 18 months National Service in the Royal Navy, where he learned Russian.
He returned to the University of Oxford in 1958 to study for a postgraduate certificate in Statistics, and it was here that he began computer programming, having been taught Autocode on the Ferranti Mercury by Leslie Fox.
He then went to Moscow State University as a British Council exchange student, where he studied machine translation under Andrey Kolmogorov.
In 1960, Hoare left the Soviet Union and began working at Elliott Brothers Ltd, a small computer manufacturing firm located in London, where he implemented ALGOL 60 and began developing major algorithms.
He became the Professor of Computing Science at the Queen's University of Belfast in 1968, and in 1977 returned to Oxford as the Professor of Computing to lead the Programming Research Group in the Oxford University Computing Laboratory (now Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford), following the death of Christopher Strachey.
He is now an Emeritus Professor there, and is also a principal researcher at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, England.
Hoare's most significant work has been in the following areas: his sorting and selection algorithm (Quicksort and Quickselect), Hoare logic, the formal language Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) used to specify the interactions between concurrent processes, structuring computer operating systems using the monitor concept, and the axiomatic specification of programming languages.
For many years under his leadership his Oxford department worked on formal specification languages such as CSP and Z.
In 1962, Hoare married Jill Pym, a member of his research team.
