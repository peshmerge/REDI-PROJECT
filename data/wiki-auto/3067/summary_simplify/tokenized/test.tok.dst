[CLS] it is formed by the junction of the va ##kh ##sh and pan ##j rivers , in the ti ##gr ##ova ##ya bal ##ka nature reserve on the border between tajikistan and afghanistan , and flows from there north - westward ##s into the southern remnants of the ara ##l sea . [SEP]
[CLS] in classical antiquity , the river was known as the in latin and in greek — a clear derivative of va ##kh ##sh , the name of the largest tributary of the river . [SEP]
[CLS] in middle persian sources of the sas ##san ##id period the river is known as ( lit . [SEP]
[CLS] the name " am ##u " is said to have come from the medieval city of " am ##ul " , ( later , cha ##har joy / char ##jun ##ow , and now known as turk ##men ##aba ##t ) , in modern turkmenistan , with " dar ##ya " being the persian word for " river " . [SEP]
[CLS] all of the water comes from the high mountains in the south where annual precipitation can be over 1000 mm . [SEP]
[CLS] even before large - scale irrigation began , high summer eva ##por ##ation meant that not all of this discharge reached the ara ##l sea – though there is some evidence the large pam ##ir glaciers provided enough melt water for the ara ##l to over ##flow during the 13th and 14th centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] since the end of the 19th century there have been four different claim ##ants as the true source of the ox ##us : a glacier turns into the wa ##khan river and joins the pam ##ir river about 50 km downstream . [SEP]
[CLS] bill cole ##grave ' s expedition to wa ##khan in 2007 found that both claim ##ants 2 and 3 had the same source , the che ##lab stream , which bi ##fur ##cate ##s on the watershed of the little pam ##ir , half flowing into lake cha ##ma ##kti ##n and half into the parent stream of the little pam ##ir / sar ##had river . [SEP]
[CLS] it is then split by the tu ##yam ##uy ##un hydro complex into many waterways that used to form the river delta joining the ara ##l sea , passing urge ##nch , das ##og ##uz , and other cities , but it does not reach what is left of the sea any more and is lost in the desert . [SEP]
[CLS] use of water from the am ##u dar ##ya for irrigation has been a major contributing factor to the shrinking of the ara ##l sea since the late 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] historical records state that in different periods , the river flowed into the ara ##l sea ( from the south ) , into the caspian sea ( from the east ) , or both , similar to the sy ##r dar ##ya ( jax ##arte ##s , in ancient greek ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the 53 ##47 ##6 ##9 km ##2 of the am ##u dar ##ya drainage basin include most of tajikistan , the southwest corner of kyrgyzstan , the northeast corner of afghanistan , a narrow portion of eastern turkmenistan and the western half of uzbekistan . [SEP]
[CLS] the abundant water flowing in the am ##u dar ##ya comes almost entirely from glaciers in the pam ##ir mountains and tian shan , which , standing above the surrounding arid plain , collect atmospheric moisture which otherwise would probably escape somewhere else . [SEP]
[CLS] when the mongols came to the area , they used the water of the am ##u dar ##ya to flood ko ##ny ##e - urge ##nch . [SEP]
[CLS] one southern route of the silk road ran along part of the am ##u dar ##ya northwest ##ward from term ##ez before going westward ##s to the caspian sea . [SEP]
[CLS] it is believed that the am ##u dar ##ya ' s course across the kara - ku ##m desert has gone through several major shifts in the past few thousand years . [SEP]
[CLS] much of the time – most recently from the 13th century to the late 16th century – the am ##u dar ##ya emptied into both the ara ##l and the caspian seas , reaching the latter via a large di ##st ##ri ##bu ##tary called the u ##z ##boy river . [SEP]
[CLS] people began to settle along the lower am ##u dar ##ya and the u ##z ##boy in the 5th century , establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands , towns , and cities . [SEP]
[CLS] in about ad 98 ##5 , the massive gu ##rgan ##j dam at the bi ##fur ##cation of the forks started to divert water to the ara ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] gen ##ghi ##s khan ' s troops destroyed the dam in 122 ##1 , and the am ##u dar ##ya shifted to distributing its flow more or less equally between the main stem and the u ##z ##boy . [SEP]
[CLS] but in the 18th century , the river again turned north , flowing into the ara ##l sea , a path it has taken since . [SEP]
[CLS] when russian explorer be ##kovich - cher ##kas ##ski surveyed the region in 1720 , the am ##u dar ##ya did not flow into the caspian sea anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] an englishman , william moor ##croft , visited the ox ##us around 1824 during the great game period . [SEP]
[CLS] another englishman , a naval officer called john wood , came with an expedition to find the source of the river in 1839 . [SEP]
[CLS] then , the french explorer and geo ##grapher th ##iba ##ut vine collected a lot of information about this area during five expeditions between 1856 and 1862 . [SEP]
[CLS] the question of finding a route between the ox ##us valley and india has been of concern historically . [SEP]
[CLS] a direct route crosses extremely high mountain passes in the hindu ku ##sh and isolated areas like ka ##fi ##rist ##an . [SEP]
[CLS] some in britain feared that the empire of russia , which at the time wi ##eld ##ed great influence over the ox ##us area , would overcome these obstacles and find a suitable route through which to invade british india – but this never came to pass . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1960s and 1970s the soviets started using the am ##u dar ##ya and the sy ##r dar ##ya to ir ##ri ##gate extensive cotton fields in the central asian plain . [SEP]
[CLS] before this time , water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture , but not on this massive scale . [SEP]
[CLS] the q ##ara ##qu ##m canal , ka ##rs ##hi canal , and bu ##khar ##a canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversion ##s built . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the main turk ##men canal , which would have diverted water along the dry u ##z ##boy river bed into central turkmenistan , was never built . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1970s , in the course of the soviet – afghan war , soviet forces used the valley to invade afghanistan through term ##ez . [SEP]
[CLS] after the fall of the soviet union this system di ##sin ##te ##grate ##d and the central asian nations have failed to reins ##tate it . [SEP]
[CLS] the caspian tiger used to occur along the river ' s banks . [SEP]
[CLS] after its ex ##ti ##rp ##ation , the dar ##ya ' s delta was suggested as a potential site for the introduction of its closest surviving relative , the siberian tiger . [SEP]
[CLS] a feasibility study was initiated to investigate if the area is suitable and if such an initiative would receive support from relevant decision makers . [SEP]
[CLS] the proposed region is therefore unsuitable for the rein ##tro ##duction , at least at this stage . [SEP]
[CLS] the ox ##us river , and arnold ' s poem , fire the imagination ##s of the children who adventure with po ##nies over the moors of the west country in the 1930s children ' s book " the far - distant ox ##us " . [SEP]
[CLS] robert byron ' s 1937 travel ##og ##ue , " the road to ox ##iana " , describes its author ' s journey from the levant through persia to afghanistan , with the ox ##us as his stated goal . [SEP]
[CLS] george macdonald fraser ' s " flash ##man at the charge " , ( 1973 ) , places flash ##man on the am ##u dar ##ya and the ar ##ral sea during the ( fictitious ) russian advance on india during the great game period . [SEP]
