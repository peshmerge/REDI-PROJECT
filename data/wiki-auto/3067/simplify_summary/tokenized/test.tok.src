[CLS] the am ##u dar ##ya , also called the am ##u or am ##o river , and historically known by its latin name , is a major river in central asia . [SEP]
[CLS] it is formed by the junction of the va ##kh ##sh and pan ##j rivers , in the ti ##gr ##ova ##ya bal ##ka nature reserve on the border between tajikistan and afghanistan , and flows from there north - westward ##s into the southern remnants of the ara ##l sea . [SEP]
[CLS] in ancient times , the river was regarded as the boundary between greater iran and tu ##ran . [SEP]
[CLS] in classical antiquity , the river was known as the in latin and in greek — a clear derivative of va ##kh ##sh , the name of the largest tributary of the river . [SEP]
[CLS] in vedic sanskrit , the river is also referred to as . [SEP]
[CLS] the bra ##hman ##da pu ##rana refers to the river as . [SEP]
[CLS] the ave ##stan texts too refer to the river as ya ##kh ##sha / va ##kh ##sha ( and ya ##kh ##sha art ##a ( " upper ya ##kh ##sha " ) referring to the jax ##arte ##s / sy ##r dar ##ya twin river to am ##u dar ##ya ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in middle persian sources of the sas ##san ##id period the river is known as ( lit . [SEP]
[CLS] the name " am ##u " is said to have come from the medieval city of " am ##ul " , ( later , cha ##har joy / char ##jun ##ow , and now known as turk ##men ##aba ##t ) , in modern turkmenistan , with " dar ##ya " being the persian word for " river " . [SEP]
[CLS] medieval arabic and islamic sources call the river " jay ##ho ##un " ( ; also " jai ##hun " , " jay ##ho ##on " , or " d ##zh ##ay ##kh ##un " ) which is derived from " gi ##hon " , the biblical name for one of the four rivers of the garden of eden . [SEP]
[CLS] western travelers in the 19th century mentioned that one of the names by which the river was known in afghanistan was " go ##zan " , and that this name was used by greek , mongol , chinese , persian , jewish , and afghan historians . [SEP]
[CLS] however , this name is no longer used . [SEP]
[CLS] the river ' s total length is 240 ##0 km and its drainage basin totals 53 ##47 ##39 km ##2 in area , providing a mean discharge of around 97 . 4 km ##3 of water per year . [SEP]
[CLS] the river is navigable for over 145 ##0 km . [SEP]
[CLS] all of the water comes from the high mountains in the south where annual precipitation can be over 1000 mm . [SEP]
[CLS] even before large - scale irrigation began , high summer eva ##por ##ation meant that not all of this discharge reached the ara ##l sea – though there is some evidence the large pam ##ir glaciers provided enough melt water for the ara ##l to over ##flow during the 13th and 14th centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] since the end of the 19th century there have been four different claim ##ants as the true source of the ox ##us : a glacier turns into the wa ##khan river and joins the pam ##ir river about 50 km downstream . [SEP]
[CLS] bill cole ##grave ' s expedition to wa ##khan in 2007 found that both claim ##ants 2 and 3 had the same source , the che ##lab stream , which bi ##fur ##cate ##s on the watershed of the little pam ##ir , half flowing into lake cha ##ma ##kti ##n and half into the parent stream of the little pam ##ir / sar ##had river . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , the che ##lab stream may be properly considered the true source or parent stream of the ox ##us . [SEP]
[CLS] the pan ##j river forms the border of afghanistan and tajikistan . [SEP]
[CLS] it flows west to is ##h ##kas ##him where it turns north and then north - west through the pam ##irs passing the tajikistan – afghanistan friendship bridge . [SEP]
[CLS] it subsequently forms the border of afghanistan and uzbekistan for about 200 km , passing term ##ez and the afghanistan – uzbekistan friendship bridge . [SEP]
[CLS] it del ##ine ##ates the border of afghanistan and turkmenistan for another 100 km before it flows into turkmenistan at ata ##mura ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] it flows across turkmenistan south to north , passing turk ##men ##aba ##t , and forms the border of turkmenistan and uzbekistan from hal ##ka ##bat . [SEP]
[CLS] it is then split by the tu ##yam ##uy ##un hydro complex into many waterways that used to form the river delta joining the ara ##l sea , passing urge ##nch , das ##og ##uz , and other cities , but it does not reach what is left of the sea any more and is lost in the desert . [SEP]
[CLS] use of water from the am ##u dar ##ya for irrigation has been a major contributing factor to the shrinking of the ara ##l sea since the late 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] historical records state that in different periods , the river flowed into the ara ##l sea ( from the south ) , into the caspian sea ( from the east ) , or both , similar to the sy ##r dar ##ya ( jax ##arte ##s , in ancient greek ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the 53 ##47 ##6 ##9 km ##2 of the am ##u dar ##ya drainage basin include most of tajikistan , the southwest corner of kyrgyzstan , the northeast corner of afghanistan , a narrow portion of eastern turkmenistan and the western half of uzbekistan . [SEP]
[CLS] part of the am ##u dar ##ya basin divide in tajikistan forms that country ' s border with china ( in the east ) and pakistan ( to the south ) . [SEP]
[CLS] about 61 % of the drainage lies within tajikistan , uzbekistan and turkmenistan , while 39 % is in afghanistan . [SEP]
[CLS] the abundant water flowing in the am ##u dar ##ya comes almost entirely from glaciers in the pam ##ir mountains and tian shan , which , standing above the surrounding arid plain , collect atmospheric moisture which otherwise would probably escape somewhere else . [SEP]
[CLS] without its mountain water sources , the am ##u dar ##ya would not contain any water — would not exist — because it rarely rains in the lowlands through which most of the river flows . [SEP]
[CLS] of the total drainage area only about 2000 ##00 km ##2 actively contribute water to the river . [SEP]
[CLS] this is because many of the river ' s major tributaries ( especially the ze ##ra ##vs ##han river ) have been diverted , and much of the river ' s drainage is arid . [SEP]
[CLS] throughout most of the steppe , the annual rainfall is about 300 mm . [SEP]
[CLS] the ancient greeks called the am ##u dar ##ya the " ox ##us " . [SEP]
[CLS] in ancient times , the river was regarded as the boundary between greater iran and tu ##ran ( . [SEP]
[CLS] the river ' s drainage lies in the area between the former empires of gen ##ghi ##s khan and alexander the great , although they occurred at very different times . [SEP]
[CLS] when the mongols came to the area , they used the water of the am ##u dar ##ya to flood ko ##ny ##e - urge ##nch . [SEP]
[CLS] one southern route of the silk road ran along part of the am ##u dar ##ya northwest ##ward from term ##ez before going westward ##s to the caspian sea . [SEP]
[CLS] it is believed that the am ##u dar ##ya ' s course across the kara - ku ##m desert has gone through several major shifts in the past few thousand years . [SEP]
[CLS] much of the time – most recently from the 13th century to the late 16th century – the am ##u dar ##ya emptied into both the ara ##l and the caspian seas , reaching the latter via a large di ##st ##ri ##bu ##tary called the u ##z ##boy river . [SEP]
[CLS] the u ##z ##boy splits off from the main channel just south of the river ' s delta . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes the flow through the two branches was more or less equal , but often most of the am ##u dar ##ya ' s flow split to the west and flowed into the caspian . [SEP]
[CLS] people began to settle along the lower am ##u dar ##ya and the u ##z ##boy in the 5th century , establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands , towns , and cities . [SEP]
[CLS] in about ad 98 ##5 , the massive gu ##rgan ##j dam at the bi ##fur ##cation of the forks started to divert water to the ara ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] gen ##ghi ##s khan ' s troops destroyed the dam in 122 ##1 , and the am ##u dar ##ya shifted to distributing its flow more or less equally between the main stem and the u ##z ##boy . [SEP]
[CLS] but in the 18th century , the river again turned north , flowing into the ara ##l sea , a path it has taken since . [SEP]
[CLS] less and less water flowed down the u ##z ##boy . [SEP]
[CLS] when russian explorer be ##kovich - cher ##kas ##ski surveyed the region in 1720 , the am ##u dar ##ya did not flow into the caspian sea anymore . [SEP]
[CLS] an englishman , william moor ##croft , visited the ox ##us around 1824 during the great game period . [SEP]
[CLS] another englishman , a naval officer called john wood , came with an expedition to find the source of the river in 1839 . [SEP]
[CLS] he found modern - day lake z ##or ##ku ##l , called it lake victoria , and proclaimed he had found the source . [SEP]
[CLS] then , the french explorer and geo ##grapher th ##iba ##ut vine collected a lot of information about this area during five expeditions between 1856 and 1862 . [SEP]
[CLS] the question of finding a route between the ox ##us valley and india has been of concern historically . [SEP]
[CLS] a direct route crosses extremely high mountain passes in the hindu ku ##sh and isolated areas like ka ##fi ##rist ##an . [SEP]
[CLS] some in britain feared that the empire of russia , which at the time wi ##eld ##ed great influence over the ox ##us area , would overcome these obstacles and find a suitable route through which to invade british india – but this never came to pass . [SEP]
[CLS] the area was taken over by russia during the russian conquest of turk ##est ##an . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet union became the ruling power in the early 1920s and expelled mohammed ali ##m khan . [SEP]
[CLS] it later put down the bas ##mac ##hi movement and killed ibrahim be ##k . [SEP]
[CLS] a large refugee population of central asian ##s , including turk ##men , ta ##ji ##ks and u ##zbek ##s , fled to northern afghanistan . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1960s and 1970s the soviets started using the am ##u dar ##ya and the sy ##r dar ##ya to ir ##ri ##gate extensive cotton fields in the central asian plain . [SEP]
[CLS] before this time , water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture , but not on this massive scale . [SEP]
[CLS] the q ##ara ##qu ##m canal , ka ##rs ##hi canal , and bu ##khar ##a canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversion ##s built . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the main turk ##men canal , which would have diverted water along the dry u ##z ##boy river bed into central turkmenistan , was never built . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1970s , in the course of the soviet – afghan war , soviet forces used the valley to invade afghanistan through term ##ez . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet union fell in the 1990s and central asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie within or partially within the am ##u dar ##ya basin . [SEP]
[CLS] during the soviet era , a resource - sharing system was ins ##tated in which kyrgyzstan and tajikistan shared water originating from the am ##u and sy ##r dar ##yas with kazakhstan , turkmenistan , and uzbekistan in summer . [SEP]
[CLS] in return , kyrgyzstan and tajikistan received kazakh , turk ##men , and u ##zbek coal , gas , and electricity in winter . [SEP]
[CLS] after the fall of the soviet union this system di ##sin ##te ##grate ##d and the central asian nations have failed to reins ##tate it . [SEP]
[CLS] inadequate infrastructure , poor water - management , and outdated irrigation methods all ex ##ace ##rba ##te the issue . [SEP]
[CLS] the caspian tiger used to occur along the river ' s banks . [SEP]
[CLS] after its ex ##ti ##rp ##ation , the dar ##ya ' s delta was suggested as a potential site for the introduction of its closest surviving relative , the siberian tiger . [SEP]
[CLS] a feasibility study was initiated to investigate if the area is suitable and if such an initiative would receive support from relevant decision makers . [SEP]
[CLS] a viable tiger population of about 100 animals would require at least 5000 km ##2 of large tracts of contiguous habitat with rich prey populations . [SEP]
[CLS] such habitat is not available at this stage and cannot be provided in the short term . [SEP]
[CLS] the proposed region is therefore unsuitable for the rein ##tro ##duction , at least at this stage . [SEP]
[CLS] the ox ##us river , and arnold ' s poem , fire the imagination ##s of the children who adventure with po ##nies over the moors of the west country in the 1930s children ' s book " the far - distant ox ##us " . [SEP]
[CLS] there were two sequels , " escape to persia " and " ox ##us in summer " . [SEP]
[CLS] robert byron ' s 1937 travel ##og ##ue , " the road to ox ##iana " , describes its author ' s journey from the levant through persia to afghanistan , with the ox ##us as his stated goal . [SEP]
[CLS] george macdonald fraser ' s " flash ##man at the charge " , ( 1973 ) , places flash ##man on the am ##u dar ##ya and the ar ##ral sea during the ( fictitious ) russian advance on india during the great game period . [SEP]
