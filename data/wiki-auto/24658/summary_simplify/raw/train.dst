The Premier of Tasmania is the head of the executive government in the Australian state of Tasmania.
By convention, the leader of the party or political grouping which has majority support in the House of Assembly is invited by the Governor of Tasmania to be Premier and principal adviser.
Since the 2014 election, the Premier of Tasmania has been Will Hodgman, leader of the Liberal Party.
Hodgman won a second term at the 2018 election, and now holds 13 of the 25 seats in the House of Assembly.
Before the 1890s, there was no formal party system in Tasmania.
The current convention of appointing the Premier from the House of Assembly was not generally applied prior to 1920, with Premiers often appointed from the Legislative Council.
