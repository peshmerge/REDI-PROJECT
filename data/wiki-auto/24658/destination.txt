The Premier of Tasmania is the head of the government in the Australian state of Tasmania.
The political party which has the most support in the House of Assembly will nominate its leader to be Premier.
The leader is then asked by the Governor of Tasmania to act as their principal adviser.
The current premier is Will Hodgman of the Liberal Party of Australia, who was sworn in on 31 March 2014.
Before the 1890s, there was no political party system in Tasmania.
Before 1920 premiers were often appointed from the Legislative Council.
