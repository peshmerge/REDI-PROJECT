[CLS] the environments in " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " are highly des ##truct ##ible and interactive ; most props can be destroyed by the player . [SEP]
[CLS] levels were designed in a fairly non - linear manner such that players can advantage ##ously use air duct ##s , back doors , and sewer ##s to avoid enemies or find hidden cache ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] these locations are also filled with objects with which the player can interact , that either benefit the player in some form , light switches make it easier to see , while water fountains and broken hydra ##nts provide some health points or simply diversion , and tipping strip ##pers provoke ##s a quote from duke , and a provocative reveal from the dancer .

[CLS] the development team consisted of eight people for most of the development cycle , increasing to 12 or 13 people near the end . [SEP]
[CLS] at one point , the game was being programmed to allow the player to switch between first person view , third person view , and fixed camera angles . [SEP]
[CLS] scott miller of 3d realms recalled that " with " duke 3d " , unlike every shooter that came before , we wanted to have sort of real life locations like a cinema theatre , you know , strip club , bookstore ##s . . . " [SEP]

[CLS] another version of the song was recorded by chris k ##line in august 2005 . [SEP]
[CLS] 3d realms featured it on the front page of their website and contracted with k ##line to use it to promote their xbox live release of " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " . [SEP]
[CLS] the original official website was created by jeffrey d . er ##b and mark far ##ish of inter ##sphere communications ltd . [SEP]
[CLS] " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " was ported to many consoles of the time . [SEP]
[CLS] all of the ports featured some sort of new content . [SEP]
[CLS] " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " was a commercial hit , selling about 3 . 5 million copies . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states alone , it was the 12th best - selling computer game from 1993 to 1999 , with 950 , 000 units sold . [SEP]
[CLS] following the release of the " doom " source code in 1997 , gamer ##s wanted a similar source code release from 3d realms . [SEP]
[CLS] the last major game to make use of the " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " source code was tnt team ' s " world war ii gi " in 1999 . [SEP]
[CLS] its programmer , matthew sa ##ett ##ler , obtained permission from 3d realms to expand the gameplay enhancement ##s done on " wwii gi " to " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " . [SEP]
[CLS] " ed ##uke " was a semi - official branch of " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " that was released as a patch as " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " v ##2 . 0 for " atomic edition " users on july 28 , 2000 . [SEP]
[CLS] it included a demo mod made by several beta test ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] it focused primarily on enhancing the con script ##ing language in ways which allowed those modifying the game to do much more with the system than originally possible . [SEP]
[CLS] though a further version was planned , it never made it out of beta . [SEP]
[CLS] it was eventually cancelled due to programmer time constraints . [SEP]
[CLS] about a month after the release of the " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " source code , " blood " project manager matt sa ##ett ##ler released the source code for both " ed ##uke " v ##2 . 0 and ed ##uke v ##2 . 1 , the test version of which would have eventually become the next " ed ##uke " release , under the gp ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] the source code to the " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " v ##1 . 5 ex ##ec ##utable , which uses the build engine , was released as free software under the gp ##l on april 1 , 2003 . [SEP]
[CLS] the game content remains under a proprietary license . [SEP]
[CLS] the game was quickly ported by enthusiasts to modern operating systems . [SEP]
[CLS] the first " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " port was from icc ##ulus . org . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a cross - platform project that allows the game to be played on amiga ##os , amiga ##os 4 , ar ##os , be ##os , free ##bs ##d , linux , mac os x , mor ##ph ##os , solar ##is , and windows rather than ms - dos . [SEP]
[CLS] the icc ##ulus . org code ##base would later be used as the base for several other ports , including " duke ##3d _ 32 " . [SEP]
[CLS] another popular early project was jon ##ath ##on fowler ' s " j ##f ##duk ##e ##3d " , which , in december 2003 , received backing from the original author of build , programmer ken silver ##man . [SEP]
[CLS] fowler , in cooperation with silver ##man , released a new version of " j ##f ##duk ##e ##3d " using poly ##most , an open ##gl - enhanced render ##er for build which allows hardware acceleration and 3d model support along with 32 - bit color high resolution textures . [SEP]
[CLS] another project based on " j ##f ##duk ##e ##3d " called " x ##duk ##e " , unrelated to the " x ##duk ##e " project based on " duke ##3d _ w ##32 " , runs on the xbox . [SEP]
[CLS] silver ##man has since helped fowler with a large portion of other engine work , including up ##dating the network code , and helping to maintain various other aspects of the engine . [SEP]
[CLS] development appears to have stopped ; as of january 2015 , there have been no new versions since october 9 , 2005 . [SEP]
[CLS] while a few short - lived dos - based " ed ##uke " projects emerged , it was not until the release of " ed ##uke ##32 " , an extended version of " duke ##3d " incorporating variants of both fowler ' s microsoft windows " j ##f ##duk ##e ##3d " code , and sa ##ett ##ler ' s " ed ##uke code " , by one of 3d realms ' forum moderator ##s in late 2004 , that " ed ##uke ' s " script ##ing extensions received community focus . [SEP]
[CLS] among the various enhancement ##s , support for advanced shade ##r model 3 . 0 based graphics was added to " ed ##uke ##32 " during late 2008 - early 2009 . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 2008 , thanks to significant port ##ing contributions from the dos ##box team , " ed ##uke ##32 " became the only " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " source port to com ##pile and run native ##ly on 64 - bit linux systems without the use of a 32 - bit compatibility environment . [SEP]
[CLS] on april 1 , 2009 , an open ##gl shade ##r model 3 . 0 render ##er was revealed to have been developed for " ed ##uke ##32 " , named " polymer " to distinguish from ken silver ##man ' s " poly ##most " . [SEP]
[CLS] it allows for much more modern effects such as dynamic lighting and normal mapping . [SEP]
[CLS] although polymer is fully functional , it is technically incomplete and uno ##pt ##imi ##zed , and is still in development . [SEP]
[CLS] as of the fifth installment of the " high resolution pack " , released in 2011 , the polymer render ##er is mandatory . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2011 , another significant development of " ed ##uke ##32 " was the introduction of true room over room ( tr ##or ) , where sectors can be placed over other sectors , and can be seen at the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] in practice , this allows for true three - dimensional level design that was previously impossible , although the base engine is still 2d . [SEP]
[CLS] on december 18 , 2012 , " chocolate duke ##3d " port was released . [SEP]
[CLS] inspired by " chocolate doom " , the primary goal was to ref ##act ##or the code so developers would easily read and learn from it . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 2013 , a source code review article was published that described the internal working of the code . [SEP]
[CLS] all versions of the game have earned a positive aggregate score on gamer ##an ##king ##s and metacritic . [SEP]

[CLS] he praised the imaginative weapons , long and complex single - player campaign , competitive multiplayer , built - in level editor , and parental lock . [SEP]
[CLS] reviewers paid a lot of attention to the sexual content within the game . [SEP]
[CLS] reception of this element varied : tim so ##ete of games ##pot felt that it was " morally questionable " , while the game revolution reviewer noted that it was " done in a tongue - in - cheek manner , " and he was " not personally offended " . [SEP]
[CLS] gaming ##on ##lin ##ux reviewer hamish paul wilson commented in a later retrospective how the game ' s " dark d ##yst ##op ##ian atmosphere filled with pornography and consumer ##ist decade ##nce " in his view helped to ground " the game ' s more out ##land ##ish and obscene moments in context " , concluding that " in a world as per ##verse as this , someone like duke becoming its hero seems almost inevitable . " [SEP]
[CLS] " next generation " reviewed the macintosh version of the game , rating it four stars out of five , and stated that " though it took a year , the mac port of " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " is an impressive feat , both for the game ' s own features , and the quality of the port . " [SEP]
[CLS] " next generation " reviewed the nintendo 64 version of the game " duke nu ##ke ##m 64 " , rating it three stars out of five , and stated that " the sound effects and music are solid , the levels are still interactive as heck , and it ' s never quite felt so good blasting enemies with a shotgun or blowing them to chunks with pipe bombs . " [SEP]

[CLS] in 2009 , ign ' s cam shea ranked it as the ninth top 10 xbox live arcade game , stating that it was as fun as it was in its initial release , and praised the ability to re ##wind to any point before the player died . [SEP]
[CLS] japanese gaming magazine " fa ##mit ##su " reviewed the playstation console port , giving it a 21 out of 40 score . [SEP]
[CLS] " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " was attacked by some critics , who alleged that it promoted pornography and murder . [SEP]
[CLS] jam ##ia wilson , then vice president of women ' s media center , criticized the depictions of women for being " extremely harmful , especially to young women " . [SEP]
[CLS] in response to the criticism encountered , ce ##nsor ##ed versions of the game were released in certain countries in order to avoid it being banned altogether . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar ce ##nsor ##ed version was carried at wal - mart retail stores in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] in australia , the game was originally refused classification on release . [SEP]
[CLS] 3d realms rep ##ack ##aged the game with the parental lock feature permanently enabled , although a patch available on the 3d realms website allowed the user to rev ##ert the game back into its un ##cens ##ored u . s . version . [SEP]
[CLS] the of ##lc then attempted to have the game pulled from the shelves , but it was discovered that the distributor had notified them of this fact and the rating could not be surrendered ; six months later , the game was rec ##lassified and released un ##cens ##ored with an ma ##15 + rating . [SEP]
[CLS] in germany , the bp ##jm placed the game on their " list b " ( " list of media harmful to young people " ) of videos games , thus prohibiting its advertisement in the public . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it was not fully confiscated , meaning that an adult could still request to see the game and buy it . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1999 , " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " was banned in brazil , along with " doom " and several other first - person shooters after a rampage , in and around a movie theater , was supposedly inspired by the first level in the game . [SEP]
[CLS] despite such concerns from critics , legislators , and publishers , scott miller later recounted that 3d realms saw very little negative feedback to the game ' s controversial elements from actual gamer ##s or their parents . [SEP]
[CLS] he pointed out that " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " was appropriately rated " m " and had no real nu ##dity , and speculated that that was enough to make it in ##off ##ens ##ive to the general public . [SEP]
