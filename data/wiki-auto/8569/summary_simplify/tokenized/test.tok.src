[CLS] the original official website was created by jeffrey d . er ##b and mark far ##ish of inter ##sphere communications ltd . [SEP]
[CLS] " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " was ported to many consoles of the time . [SEP]
[CLS] all of the ports featured some sort of new content . [SEP]
[CLS] following the release of the " doom " source code in 1997 , gamer ##s wanted a similar source code release from 3d realms . [SEP]
[CLS] its programmer , matthew sa ##ett ##ler , obtained permission from 3d realms to expand the gameplay enhancement ##s done on " wwii gi " to " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " . [SEP]
[CLS] though a further version was planned , it never made it out of beta . [SEP]
[CLS] about a month after the release of the " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " source code , " blood " project manager matt sa ##ett ##ler released the source code for both " ed ##uke " v ##2 . 0 and ed ##uke v ##2 . 1 , the test version of which would have eventually become the next " ed ##uke " release , under the gp ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] the source code to the " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " v ##1 . 5 ex ##ec ##utable , which uses the build engine , was released as free software under the gp ##l on april 1 , 2003 . [SEP]
[CLS] the game was quickly ported by enthusiasts to modern operating systems . [SEP]
[CLS] another popular early project was jon ##ath ##on fowler ' s " j ##f ##duk ##e ##3d " , which , in december 2003 , received backing from the original author of build , programmer ken silver ##man . [SEP]
[CLS] fowler , in cooperation with silver ##man , released a new version of " j ##f ##duk ##e ##3d " using poly ##most , an open ##gl - enhanced render ##er for build which allows hardware acceleration and 3d model support along with 32 - bit color high resolution textures . [SEP]
[CLS] silver ##man has since helped fowler with a large portion of other engine work , including up ##dating the network code , and helping to maintain various other aspects of the engine . [SEP]
[CLS] while a few short - lived dos - based " ed ##uke " projects emerged , it was not until the release of " ed ##uke ##32 " , an extended version of " duke ##3d " incorporating variants of both fowler ' s microsoft windows " j ##f ##duk ##e ##3d " code , and sa ##ett ##ler ' s " ed ##uke code " , by one of 3d realms ' forum moderator ##s in late 2004 , that " ed ##uke ' s " script ##ing extensions received community focus . [SEP]
[CLS] among the various enhancement ##s , support for advanced shade ##r model 3 . 0 based graphics was added to " ed ##uke ##32 " during late 2008 - early 2009 . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 2008 , thanks to significant port ##ing contributions from the dos ##box team , " ed ##uke ##32 " became the only " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " source port to com ##pile and run native ##ly on 64 - bit linux systems without the use of a 32 - bit compatibility environment . [SEP]
[CLS] on april 1 , 2009 , an open ##gl shade ##r model 3 . 0 render ##er was revealed to have been developed for " ed ##uke ##32 " , named " polymer " to distinguish from ken silver ##man ' s " poly ##most " . [SEP]
[CLS] as of the fifth installment of the " high resolution pack " , released in 2011 , the polymer render ##er is mandatory . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2011 , another significant development of " ed ##uke ##32 " was the introduction of true room over room ( tr ##or ) , where sectors can be placed over other sectors , and can be seen at the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] in practice , this allows for true three - dimensional level design that was previously impossible , although the base engine is still 2d . [SEP]
[CLS] inspired by " chocolate doom " , the primary goal was to ref ##act ##or the code so developers would easily read and learn from it . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 2013 , a source code review article was published that described the internal working of the code . [SEP]
[CLS] he particularly cited the game ' s speed and fluid ##ity even on low - end pcs , imaginative weapons , varied and identifiable environments , true 3d level designs , and strong multiplayer mode . [SEP]
[CLS] reviewers paid a lot of attention to the sexual content within the game . [SEP]
[CLS] reception of this element varied : tim so ##ete of games ##pot felt that it was " morally questionable " , while the game revolution reviewer noted that it was " done in a tongue - in - cheek manner , " and he was " not personally offended " . [SEP]
[CLS] gaming ##on ##lin ##ux reviewer hamish paul wilson commented in a later retrospective how the game ' s " dark d ##yst ##op ##ian atmosphere filled with pornography and consumer ##ist decade ##nce " in his view helped to ground " the game ' s more out ##land ##ish and obscene moments in context " , concluding that " in a world as per ##verse as this , someone like duke becoming its hero seems almost inevitable . " [SEP]
[CLS] " next generation " reviewed the macintosh version of the game , rating it four stars out of five , and stated that " though it took a year , the mac port of " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " is an impressive feat , both for the game ' s own features , and the quality of the port . " [SEP]
[CLS] " next generation " reviewed the nintendo 64 version of the game " duke nu ##ke ##m 64 " , rating it three stars out of five , and stated that " the sound effects and music are solid , the levels are still interactive as heck , and it ' s never quite felt so good blasting enemies with a shotgun or blowing them to chunks with pipe bombs . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1996 , " next generation " ranked it as the 35th top game of all time , called " for many , the game " quake " should have been . " [SEP]

[CLS] " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " was attacked by some critics , who alleged that it promoted pornography and murder . [SEP]
[CLS] jam ##ia wilson , then vice president of women ' s media center , criticized the depictions of women for being " extremely harmful , especially to young women " . [SEP]
[CLS] 3d realms rep ##ack ##aged the game with the parental lock feature permanently enabled , although a patch available on the 3d realms website allowed the user to rev ##ert the game back into its un ##cens ##ored u . s . version . [SEP]
[CLS] the of ##lc then attempted to have the game pulled from the shelves , but it was discovered that the distributor had notified them of this fact and the rating could not be surrendered ; six months later , the game was rec ##lassified and released un ##cens ##ored with an ma ##15 + rating . [SEP]
[CLS] in germany , the bp ##jm placed the game on their " list b " ( " list of media harmful to young people " ) of videos games , thus prohibiting its advertisement in the public . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it was not fully confiscated , meaning that an adult could still request to see the game and buy it . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1999 , " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " was banned in brazil , along with " doom " and several other first - person shooters after a rampage , in and around a movie theater , was supposedly inspired by the first level in the game . [SEP]
[CLS] despite such concerns from critics , legislators , and publishers , scott miller later recounted that 3d realms saw very little negative feedback to the game ' s controversial elements from actual gamer ##s or their parents . [SEP]
[CLS] he pointed out that " duke nu ##ke ##m 3d " was appropriately rated " m " and had no real nu ##dity , and speculated that that was enough to make it in ##off ##ens ##ive to the general public . [SEP]
