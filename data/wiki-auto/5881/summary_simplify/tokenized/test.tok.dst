[CLS] " century " is sometimes abbreviated as c . [SEP]
[CLS] a centenary is a hundred ##th anniversary , or a celebration of this , typically the remembrance of an event which took place a hundred years earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] although a century can mean any arbitrary period of 100 years , a standard century in the gregorian calendar is a period starting on a year of which the last two digits are 01 and ending on the following year which is a multiple of 100 : the 1st century was the period from 1 to 100 , the 2nd century the period from 101 to 200 , and so on . [SEP]
[CLS] although , the most common way to count centuries as well as decades is to group years based on their shared digits ( i . e . [SEP]
[CLS] however , this way to count centuries is formally not correct , as these periods end on a year of which the last two digits are 99 ( i . e . [SEP]
[CLS] 1999 ) , and these years are no multiple ##s of 100 ; this would make the 1st century being the period from 1 to 99 which is not a period of 100 years . [SEP]
[CLS] the astronomical year numbering and iso 86 ##01 systems both contain a year zero , so the first century begins with the year zero , rather than the year one . [SEP]
[CLS] informally , years may be referred to in groups based on the hundreds part of the year . [SEP]
[CLS] while the century has been commonly used in the west , other cultures and calendar ##s have utilized differently sized groups of years in a similar manner . [SEP]
[CLS] the hindu calendar , in particular , sum ##mar ##izes its years into groups of 60 , while the aztec calendar considers groups of 52 . [SEP]
