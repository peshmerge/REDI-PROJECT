"Century" is sometimes abbreviated as c.
A centenary is a hundredth anniversary, or a celebration of this, typically the remembrance of an event which took place a hundred years earlier.
Although a century can mean any arbitrary period of 100 years, a standard century in the Gregorian calendar is a period starting on a year of which the last two digits are 01 and ending on the following year which is a multiple of 100: The 1st century was the period from 1 to 100, the 2nd century the period from 101 to 200, and so on.
Although, the most common way to count centuries as well as decades is to group years based on their shared digits (i.e.
However, this way to count centuries is formally not correct, as these periods end on a year of which the last two digits are 99 (i.e.
1999), and these years are no multiples of 100; this would make the 1st century being the period from 1 to 99 which is not a period of 100 years.
The astronomical year numbering and ISO 8601 systems both contain a year zero, so the first century begins with the year zero, rather than the year one.
Informally, years may be referred to in groups based on the hundreds part of the year.
While the century has been commonly used in the West, other cultures and calendars have utilized differently sized groups of years in a similar manner.
The Hindu calendar, in particular, summarizes its years into groups of 60, while the Aztec calendar considers groups of 52.
