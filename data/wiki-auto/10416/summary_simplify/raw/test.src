Emperor Bidatsu (敏達天皇 , Bidatsu-tennō , 538 – 14 September 585) was the 30th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
The years of reign of Bidatsu start in 572 and end in 585; however, there are no certain dates for this Emperor's life or reign.
The names and sequence of the early Emperors were not confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kanmu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.
The name Bidatsu"-tennō" was created for him posthumously by later generations.
In the 15th year of Kimmei's reign, Bidatsu was named Crown Prince.
In the 32nd year of Kimmei"-tennō"'s reign (欽明天皇32年 , 572) , the old Emperor died, and the succession was received by his second son.
Soon after, Emperor Bidatsu is said to have acceded to the throne.
Bidatsu's contemporary title would not have been "tennō", as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō.
Rather, it was presumably "Sumeramikoto" or "Amenoshita Shiroshimesu Ōkimi" (治天下大王 ) , meaning "the great king who rules all under heaven".
Bidatsu sought to re-establish relations with Korean Kingdoms and, according to "Nihon Shoki", his court successfully established relations with Baekje and Silla, two of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.
The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Osaka.
He was the second son of Emperor Kinmei.
Although he had many children, none of them would ever become Emperor.
To replace her, he elevated one of his consorts, Princess Nukatabe, to the rank of empress.
Later she ascended to the throne in her own right and is today known as Empress Suiko.
He was succeeded first by one of his brothers, Emperor Yōmei, then by another, Emperor Sushun, and then Empress Suiko, his sister and wife, before his grandson, Emperor Jomei, eventually took the throne.
