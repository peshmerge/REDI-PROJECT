Emperor Bidatsu (敏達天皇, Bidatsu-tennō, 538-585) was the 30th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
The years of reign of Bidatsu start in 572 and end in 585; however, there are no certain dates for this emperor's life or reign.
The names and sequence of the early emperors were not confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.
Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Bidatsu to be possibly legendary, but probable.
The name Bidatsu"-tennō" was created for him posthumously by later generations.
He was the second son of Emperor Kimmei.
His mother, Ishi-hime, was a daughter of Emperor Senka.
His palace in Yamato Province was called Osada no Miya of Iware.
Although he had many children, none of them would ever become emperor.
According to "Gukanshō", Bidatsu had four empresses and 16 Imperial children (6 sons and 10 daughters).
In the 15th year of Kimmei's reign, Bidatsu was named Crown Prince.
In the 32nd year of Kimmei's reign (572), the emperor died; and his successor was Bidatsu.
This was confirmed in ceremonies.
Bidatsu's reign was marked by power struggles about Buddhism.
The two most important men in the court of Bidatsu were Soga no Umako and Mononobe no Moriya.
Soga supported the growth of Buddhism, and Moriya wanted to stop it.
Bidatsu suffered from an unknown disease which afflicted him with sores.
Probably, he was the first royal victim of smallpox in Japan.
In the 14th year of Bidatsu's reign (585), he died; and the succession ("senso") were passed to his younger half-brother who became known as Emperor Yōmei.
According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun").
Bidatsu is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.
