[CLS] an aromatic hydro ##carbon or aren ##e ( or sometimes ar ##yl hydro ##carbon ) is a hydro ##carbon with sigma bonds and del ##oca ##lized pi electrons between carbon atoms forming a circle . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " aromatic " was assigned before the physical mechanism determining aromatic ##ity was discovered ; the term was coined as such simply because many of the compounds have a sweet or pleasant o ##dou ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] the configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a benz ##ene ring , after the simplest possible such hydro ##carbon , benz ##ene . [SEP]
[CLS] some non - benz ##ene - based compounds called het ##ero ##are ##nes , which follow hu ##cke ##l ' s rule ( for mono ##cy ##cl ##ic rings : when the number of its π electrons equals 4 " n " + 2 , where " n " = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . ) , are also called aromatic compounds . [SEP]
[CLS] in these compounds , at least one carbon atom is replaced by one of the het ##ero ##ato ##ms oxygen , nitrogen , or sulfur . [SEP]
[CLS] examples of non - benz ##ene compounds with aromatic properties are fur ##an , a het ##ero ##cy ##cl ##ic compound with a five - member ##ed ring that includes a single oxygen atom , and p ##yr ##idi ##ne , a het ##ero ##cy ##cl ##ic compound with a six - member ##ed ring containing one nitrogen atom . [SEP]
[CLS] benz ##ene , ch , is the least complex aromatic hydro ##carbon , and it was the first one named as such . [SEP]
[CLS] each carbon atom in the he ##xa ##gonal cycle has four electrons to share . [SEP]
[CLS] this leaves one electron to share with one of the two neighbouring carbon atoms , thus creating a double bond with one carbon and leaving a single bond with the other , which is why the benz ##ene molecule is drawn with alternating single and double bonds around the he ##xa ##gon . [SEP]
[CLS] the structure is alternatively illustrated as a circle around the inside of the ring to show six electrons floating around in del ##oca ##lized molecular orbital ##s the size of the ring itself . [SEP]
[CLS] this depiction represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon – carbon bonds all of bond order 1 . 5 ; the e ##qui ##vale ##ncy is explained by resonance forms . [SEP]
[CLS] the electrons are visual ##ized as floating above and below the ring with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat . [SEP]
[CLS] the proper use of the symbol is debated ; it is used to describe any cyclic π system in some publications , or only those π systems that obey hu ##cke ##l ' s rule in others . [SEP]
[CLS] jensen argues that , in line with robinson ' s original proposal , the use of the circle symbol should be limited to mono ##cy ##cl ##ic 6 π - electron systems . [SEP]
[CLS] in this way the circle symbol for a six - center six - electron bond can be compared to the y symbol for a three - center two - electron bond . [SEP]
[CLS] al ##ky ##ne trim ##eri ##zation describes the 2 + 2 + 2 cy ##cl ##ization of three al ##ky ##nes , in the dot ##z reaction an al ##ky ##ne , carbon mono ##xide and a ch ##rom ##ium car ##ben ##e complex are the react ##ants . [SEP]
[CLS] die ##ls – al ##der reactions of al ##ky ##nes with p ##yr ##one or cy ##cl ##open ##tad ##ien ##one with expulsion of carbon dioxide or carbon mono ##xide also form aren ##e compounds . [SEP]
[CLS] in bergman cy ##cl ##ization the react ##ants are an en ##yne plus a hydrogen donor . [SEP]
[CLS] another set of methods is the aroma ##ti ##zation of cy ##cl ##oh ##ex ##ane ##s and other ali ##pha ##tic rings : re ##age ##nts are catalyst ##s used in hydrogen ##ation such as platinum , pal ##lad ##ium and nickel ( reverse hydrogen ##ation ) , qui ##non ##es and the elements sulfur and se ##len ##ium . [SEP]
[CLS] the two main types are electro ##phi ##lic aromatic substitution when the active re ##age ##nt is an electro ##phile and nu ##cle ##op ##hil ##ic aromatic substitution when the re ##age ##nt is a nu ##cle ##op ##hil ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] unusual thermal die ##ls – al ##der react ##ivity of aren ##es can be found in the wagner - ja ##ure ##gg reaction . [SEP]
[CLS] in dear ##oma ##ti ##zation reactions the aromatic ##ity of the react ##ant is permanently lost . [SEP]
[CLS] examples of benz ##ene compounds with just one sub ##sti ##tu ##ent are ph ##eno ##l , which carries a hydro ##xy ##l group , and to ##lu ##ene with a methyl group . [SEP]
[CLS] when there is more than one sub ##sti ##tu ##ent present on the ring , their spatial relationship becomes important for which the aren ##e substitution patterns " or ##th ##o " , " meta " , and " para " are devised . [SEP]
[CLS] the aren ##e ring has an ability to stabilize charges . [SEP]
[CLS] this is seen in , for example , ph ##eno ##l ( ch – oh ) , which is acidic at the hydro ##xy ##l ( oh ) , since a charge on this oxygen ( al ##ko ##xide – o ) is partially del ##oca ##lized into the benz ##ene ring . [SEP]
[CLS] studies have shown that high levels of pa ##hs are found , for example , in meat cooked at high temperatures such as grill ##ing or bar ##be ##cu ##ing , and in smoked fish . [SEP]
[CLS] they are also found in the inter ##stellar medium , in comets , and in meteor ##ites and are a candidate molecule to act as a basis for the earliest forms of life . [SEP]
