[CLS] an electrical network is an inter ##con ##ne ##ction of electrical components ( e . g . , batteries , resist ##ors , ind ##uc ##tors , cap ##ac ##itors , switches , trans ##isto ##rs ) or a model of such an inter ##con ##ne ##ction , consisting of electrical elements ( e . g . , voltage sources , current sources , resistance ##s , ind ##uc ##tance ##s , cap ##ac ##itan ##ces ) . [SEP]
[CLS] an electrical circuit is a network consisting of a closed loop , giving a return path for the current . [SEP]
[CLS] linear electrical networks , a special type consisting only of sources ( voltage or current ) , linear lump ##ed elements ( resist ##ors , cap ##ac ##itors , ind ##uc ##tors ) , and linear distributed elements ( transmission lines ) , have the property that signals are linear ##ly super ##im ##po ##sable . [SEP]
[CLS] they are thus more easily analyzed , using powerful frequency domain methods such as lap ##lace transforms , to determine dc response , ac response , and transient response . [SEP]
[CLS] a resist ##ive circuit is a circuit containing only resist ##ors and ideal current and voltage sources . [SEP]
[CLS] analysis of resist ##ive circuits is less complicated than analysis of circuits containing cap ##ac ##itors and ind ##uc ##tors . [SEP]
[CLS] if the sources are constant ( dc ) sources , the result is a dc circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] the effective resistance and current distribution properties of arbitrary resist ##or networks can be modeled in terms of their graph measures and geometric ##al properties . [SEP]
[CLS] a network that contains active electronic components is known as an " electronic circuit " . [SEP]
[CLS] such networks are generally nonlinear and require more complex design and analysis tools . [SEP]
[CLS] an active network is a network that contains an active source â€“ either a voltage source or current source . [SEP]
[CLS] a passive network is a network that does not contain an active source . [SEP]
[CLS] an active network contains one or more sources of electro ##mot ##ive force . [SEP]
[CLS] it consists of active elements like a battery or a trans ##isto ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] active elements can in ##ject power to the circuit , provide power gain , and control the current flow within the circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] passive networks do not contain any sources of electro ##mot ##ive force . [SEP]
[CLS] they consist of passive elements like resist ##ors and cap ##ac ##itors . [SEP]
[CLS] these elements are not capable of the same functions as active elements . [SEP]
[CLS] a network is linear if its signals obey the principle of super ##position ; otherwise it is non - linear . [SEP]
[CLS] discrete passive components ( resist ##ors , cap ##ac ##itors and ind ##uc ##tors ) are called " lump ##ed elements " because all of their , respectively , resistance , cap ##ac ##itan ##ce and ind ##uc ##tance is assumed to be located ( " lump ##ed " ) at one place . [SEP]
[CLS] this design philosophy is called the lump ##ed element model and networks so designed are called " lump ##ed element circuits " . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the conventional approach to circuit design . [SEP]
[CLS] at high enough frequencies the lump ##ed assumption no longer holds because there is a significant fraction of a wavelength across the component dimensions . [SEP]
[CLS] a new design model is needed for such cases called the distributed element model . [SEP]
[CLS] networks designed to this model are called " distributed element circuits " . [SEP]
[CLS] a distributed element circuit that includes some lump ##ed components is called a " semi - lump ##ed " design . [SEP]
[CLS] an example of a semi - lump ##ed circuit is the comb ##line filter . [SEP]
[CLS] sources can be classified as independent sources and dependent sources . [SEP]
[CLS] an ideal independent source maintains the same voltage or current regardless of the other elements present in the circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] its value is either constant ( dc ) or sin ##uso ##idal ( ac ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the strength of voltage or current is not changed by any variation in the connected network . [SEP]
[CLS] dependent sources depend upon a particular element of the circuit for delivering the power or voltage or current depending upon the type of source it is . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of electrical laws apply to all electrical networks . [SEP]
[CLS] other more complex laws may be needed if the network contains nonlinear or reactive components . [SEP]
[CLS] non - linear self - reg ##ener ##ative het ##ero ##dy ##ning systems can be approximate ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] applying these laws results in a set of simultaneous equations that can be solved either algebraic ##ally or numerical ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] to design any electrical circuit , either analog or digital , electrical engineers need to be able to predict the voltage ##s and currents at all places within the circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] simple linear circuits can be analyzed by hand using complex number theory . [SEP]
[CLS] in more complex cases the circuit may be analyzed with specialized computer programs or estimation techniques such as the piece ##wise - linear model . [SEP]
[CLS] circuit simulation software , such as hs ##pic ##e ( an analog circuit simulator ) , and languages such as v ##hd ##l - am ##s and ve ##ril ##og - am ##s allow engineers to design circuits without the time , cost and risk of error involved in building circuit prototypes . [SEP]
[CLS] more complex circuits can be analyzed numerical ##ly with software such as spice or gnu ##cap , or symbolic ##ally using software such as sap ##win . [SEP]
[CLS] when faced with a new circuit , the software first tries to find a steady state solution , that is , one where all nodes conform to ki ##rch ##hoff ' s current law " and " the voltage ##s across and through each element of the circuit conform to the voltage / current equations governing that element . [SEP]
[CLS] once the steady state solution is found , the " operating points " of each element in the circuit are known . [SEP]
[CLS] for a small signal analysis , every non - linear element can be linear ##ized around its operation point to obtain the small - signal estimate of the voltage ##s and currents . [SEP]
[CLS] this is an application of oh ##m ' s law . [SEP]
[CLS] the resulting linear circuit matrix can be solved with ga ##uss ##ian elimination . [SEP]
[CLS] software such as the pl ##ec ##s interface to sim ##ulin ##k uses piece ##wise - linear approximation of the equations governing the elements of a circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] the circuit is treated as a completely linear network of ideal di ##odes . [SEP]
[CLS] every time a di ##ode switches from on to off or vice versa , the configuration of the linear network changes . [SEP]
[CLS] adding more detail to the approximation of equations increases the accuracy of the simulation , but also increases its running time . [SEP]
