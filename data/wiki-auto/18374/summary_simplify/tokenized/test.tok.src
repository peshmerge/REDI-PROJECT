[CLS] lake eyre , officially known as kat ##i than ##da – lake eyre , contains the lowest natural point in australia , at approximately 15 m below sea level ( ah ##d ) , and , on the rare occasions that it fills , is the largest lake in australia , covering 950 ##0 km ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the shallow end ##or ##hei ##c lake is the de ##po ##cent ##re of the vast lake eyre basin and is found in northern south australia , some 700 km north of adelaide . [SEP]
[CLS] when the lake is full , it has the same sal ##ini ##ty level as the sea , but as the lake dr ##ies up and the water eva ##por ##ates , sal ##ini ##ty increases . [SEP]
[CLS] the lake was named by europeans in honour of edward john eyre , who was the first european to see it , in 1840 . [SEP]
[CLS] the native title over the lake and surrounding region is held by the arab ##ana people . [SEP]
[CLS] the lake eyre basin is a large end ##or ##hei ##c system surrounding the lake ##bed , the lowest part of which is filled with the characteristic salt pan caused by the seasonal expansion and subsequent eva ##por ##ation of the trapped waters . [SEP]
[CLS] even in the dry season , there is usually some water remaining in kat ##i than ##da – lake eyre , normally collecting in over 200 smaller sub - lakes within its margins . [SEP]
[CLS] during the rainy season , rivers from the north - east part of the lake eyre basin — in out ##back ( south - west and central ) queensland — flow towards the lake through the channel country . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 15 m altitude usually attributed to kat ##i than ##da – lake eyre refers to the deepest parts of the lake floor , in belt bay and the mad ##igan gulf . [SEP]
[CLS] lake eyre is divided into two sections which are joined by the go ##yde ##r channel . [SEP]
[CLS] since 1883 , proposals have been made to flood lake eyre with sea ##water brought to the basin via a canal or pipeline . [SEP]
[CLS] due to the basin ' s low elevation below sea level and the region ' s high annual eva ##por ##ation rate ( between 2500 and ) , such schemes have generally been considered imp ##rac ##tical , as it is likely that accumulation of salt deposits would rapidly block the engineered channel . [SEP]
[CLS] the sal ##ini ##ty in the lake increases as the 450 mm salt crust dissolve ##s over a period of six months of a major flood , resulting in a massive fish kill . [SEP]
[CLS] when over 4 m deep , the lake is no more salty than the sea , but sal ##ini ##ty increases as the water eva ##por ##ates , with sat ##uration occurring at about a 500 mm depth . [SEP]
[CLS] the water in the lake soon eva ##por ##ates , with a minor or medium flood drying by the end of the following summer . [SEP]
[CLS] when recently flooded , the lake is almost fresh , and native freshwater fish , including bony br ##ea ##m ( " ne ##mat ##olo ##sa er ##eb ##i " ) , the lake eyre basin sub - species of golden perch ( " mac ##qua ##ria am ##bi ##gua " ) and various small hardy ##head species ( " crater ##oc ##ep ##hal ##us " spp . ) [SEP]
[CLS] the 2009 lake eyre flood peaked at 1 . 5 m deep in late may , which is a quarter of its maximum recorded depth of 6 m . [SEP]
[CLS] 9 km ##3 of water crossed the queensland – south australian border with most of it coming from massive floods in the georgina river . [SEP]
[CLS] however , owing to the very low rainfall in the lower reaches of these rivers ( contrasting with heavy rainfall in the upper catchment ##s ) , the greater proportion soaked into the desert or eva ##por ##ated en route to the lake , leaving less than 4 km ##3 in the lake , which covered an area of 800 km ##2 , or 12 % of the total . [SEP]
[CLS] as the flood did not start filling the lake ' s deepest point ( belt bay ) until late march , little bird life appeared , preferring instead to nest in the upper reaches of the lake eyre basin , north of birds ##ville , where large lakes appeared in january as a result of monsoon ##al rain . [SEP]
[CLS] the high rainfall in summer 2010 sent flood water into the dia ##man ##tina , georgina and cooper creek catchment ##s of the lake eyre basin , with the cooper creek reaching the lake for the first time since 1990 . [SEP]
[CLS] heavy local rain in early march 2011 in the stuart creek and war ##rine ##r catchment ##s filled lake eyre south , with lake eyre north about 75 per cent covered with water firstly from the neal ##es and mac ##umb ##a rivers , and later from the war ##bu ##rton river . [SEP]
[CLS] in late 2015 , water began flowing into lake eyre following heavy rain in the north - east of the state . [SEP]
[CLS] traditional owners and graz ##iers agree that it is essential that the river run its course and should not be harvested during floods , as any interference in the natural systems could damage the ecosystem . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of 6 m trailer sail ##ers sailed on kat ##i than ##da – lake eyre in 1975 , 1976 , and 1984 , when the flood depth reached 3 – . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 2010 the yacht club held its first regatta since 1976 and its first on lake kill ##amp ##er ##pu ##nna , a freshwater lake on cooper creek . [SEP]
[CLS] when the lake is full , a notable phenomenon is that around midday the surface can often become very flat . [SEP]
[CLS] the surface then reflects the sky in a way that leaves both the horizon and water surface virtually impossible to see . [SEP]
[CLS] the commodore of the lake eyre yacht club has stated that sailing during this time has the appearance of sailing in the sky . [SEP]
[CLS] kat ##i than ##da – lake eyre has been a site for various land speed record attempts on its salt flats , similar to those found in the bonn ##eville salt flats , especially those by donald campbell with the blue ##bird - pro ##te ##us cn ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] scientists are presently unable to determine how such birds appear able to detect the filling of the lake , even when hundreds or thousands of kilometres away from the basin . [SEP]
[CLS] the extent of the lake is covered by two protected areas declared by the government of south australia - the kat ##i than ##da - lake eyre national park and the elliot price conservation park . [SEP]
[CLS] lake eyre has been identified by bird ##life international as an important bird area ( ib ##a ) known as the lake eyre important bird area , because , when flooded , it supports major breeding events of the banded stil ##t and australian pe ##lica ##n , as well as over 1 % of the world populations of red - neck ##ed av ##oc ##ets , sharp - tailed sand ##pipe ##rs , red - neck ##ed stint ##s , silver gu ##lls and caspian ter ##ns .
