Loris is the common name for the strepsirrhine primates of the subfamily Lorinae (sometimes spelled Lorisinae) in the family Lorisidae.
"Loris" is one genus in this subfamily and includes the slender lorises, while "Nycticebus" is the genus containing the slow lorises.
They are found in tropical and woodland forests of India, Sri Lanka, and parts of southeast Asia.
Some lorises are almost entirely insectivorous, while others also include fruits, gums, leaves, and slugs in their diet.
Before they do this, they bathe their young with allergenic saliva that is acquired by licking patches on the insides of their elbows, which produce a mild toxin that discourages most predators, though orangutans occasionally eat lorises.
The family Lorisidae is found within the infraorder Lemuriformes and superfamily Lorisoidea, along with the family Galagidae, the galagos.
