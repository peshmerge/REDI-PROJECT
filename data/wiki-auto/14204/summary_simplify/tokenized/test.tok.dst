[CLS] some well - known species give off a red color from car ##ote ##no ##id compounds , notably ba ##cter ##ior ##ho ##do ##ps ##in . [SEP]
[CLS] halo ##phile ##s can be found anywhere with a concentration of salt five times greater than the salt concentration of the ocean , such as the great salt lake in utah , owens lake in california , the dead sea , and in eva ##por ##ation ponds . [SEP]
[CLS] high sal ##ini ##ty represents an extreme environment to which relatively few organisms have been able to adapt and occupy . [SEP]
[CLS] to survive the high sal ##ini ##ties , halo ##phile ##s employ two differing strategies to prevent des ##ic ##cation through os ##mot ##ic movement of water out of their cy ##top ##las ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] both strategies work by increasing the internal os ##mo ##lar ##ity of the cell . [SEP]
[CLS] in the first ( which is employed by the majority of halo ##phi ##lic bacteria , some arch ##aea , yeast ##s , algae and fungi ) , organic compounds are accumulated in the cy ##top ##las ##m â€” os ##mo ##pro ##tec ##tan ##ts which are known as compatible sol ##ute ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common compatible sol ##ute ##s are neutral or z ##wi ##tter ##ion ##ic , and include amino acids , sugar ##s , poly ##ols , beta ##ines , and ec ##to ##ines , as well as derivatives of some of these compounds . [SEP]
[CLS] the second , more radical adaptation involves the selective influx of potassium ( k ) ions into the cy ##top ##las ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence of this adaptation in three distinct evolutionary lineage ##s suggests converge ##nt evolution of this strategy , it being unlikely to be an ancient characteristic retained in only scattered groups or passed on through massive lateral gene transfer . [SEP]
[CLS] must be adapted to high salt levels , whereas in the compatible sol ##ute adaptation , little or no adjustment is required to intra ##cellular macro ##mo ##le ##cule ##s ; in fact , the compatible sol ##ute ##s often act as more general stress protect ##ants , as well as just os ##mo ##pro ##tec ##tan ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] of particular note are the extreme halo ##phile ##s or halo ##ar ##cha ##ea ( often known as halo ##ba ##cter ##ia ) , a group of arch ##aea , which require at least a 2 m salt concentration and are usually found in saturated solutions ( about 36 % w / v salts ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these are the primary inhabitants of salt lakes , inland seas , and eva ##por ##ating ponds of sea ##water , such as the deep salt ##ern ##s , where they tin ##t the water column and sediments bright colors . [SEP]
[CLS] these species most likely per ##ish if they are exposed to anything other than a very high - concentration , salt - conditioned environment . [SEP]
[CLS] the high concentration of sodium chloride in their environment limits the availability of oxygen for res ##piration . [SEP]
[CLS] their cellular machinery is adapted to high salt concentrations by having charged amino acids on their surfaces , allowing the retention of water molecules around these components . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , many cells are so fragile that when placed in di ##sti ##lled water , they immediately l ##yse from the change in os ##mot ##ic conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] halo ##phile ##s may use a variety of energy sources . [SEP]
[CLS] the halo ##ar ##cha ##ea , and particularly the family halo ##ba ##cter ##iaceae , are members of the domain arch ##aea , and comprise the majority of the pro ##kar ##yo ##tic population in hyper ##sal ##ine environments . [SEP]
[CLS] the domain bacteria ( mainly " sal ##ini ##ba ##cter rub ##er " ) can comprise up to 25 % of the pro ##kar ##yo ##tic community , but is more commonly a much lower percentage of the overall population . [SEP]
[CLS] a comparatively wide range of taxa has been isolated from salt ##ern crystal ##lis ##er ponds , including members of these genera : " halo ##fera ##x , halo ##ge ##ometric ##um , halo ##co ##ccus , halo ##ter ##ri ##gen ##a , halo ##ru ##br ##um , halo ##ar ##cula " , and " halo ##ba ##cter ##ium " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the viable counts in these cultivation studies have been small when compared to total counts , and the numerical significance of these isolate ##s has been unclear . [SEP]
[CLS] only recently has it become possible to determine the identities and relative abundance ##s of organisms in natural populations , typically using pc ##r - based strategies that target 16 ##s small subunit rib ##osomal rib ##on ##uc ##lei ##c acid ( 16 ##s rr ##na ) genes . [SEP]
[CLS] while comparatively few studies of this type have been performed , results from these suggest that some of the most readily isolated and studied genera may not in fact be significant in the " in situ " community . [SEP]
[CLS] the comparative gen ##omic and pro ##te ##omic analysis showed distinct molecular signatures exist for environmental adaptation of halo ##phile ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] at the protein level , the halo ##phi ##lic species are characterized by low hydro ##phobic ##ity , over ##re ##pres ##entation of acidic residues , under ##re ##pres ##entation of cy ##s , lower prop ##ens ##ities for helix formation , and higher prop ##ens ##ities for coil structure . [SEP]
[CLS] " halo ##ba ##cter ##ium " is a genus of the arch ##aea that has a high tolerance for elevated levels of sal ##ini ##ty . [SEP]
[CLS] some species of halo ##ba ##cter ##ia have acidic proteins that resist the den ##at ##uring effects of salts . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the ma ##k ##ga ##di ##k ##ga ##di pan ##s in botswana form a vast , seasonal , high - sal ##ini ##ty water body that manifest ##s halo ##phi ##lic species within the dia ##tom genus " ni ##tz ##sch ##ia " in the family ba ##ci ##llar ##iaceae , as well as species within the genus " love ##nu ##la " in the family dia ##pt ##omi ##dae . [SEP]
[CLS] even species that can tolerate salt concentrations close to sat ##uration ( for example " ho ##rta ##ea we ##rne ##cki ##i " ) in almost all cases grow well in standard micro ##bio ##logical media without the addition of salt . [SEP]
[CLS] one example is " ch ##rom ##oh ##alo ##ba ##cter bei ##jer ##in ##cki ##i " , found in salt ##ed beans preserved in br ##ine and in salt ##ed herring . [SEP]
[CLS] they have limited access to fresh water sources on the island and to their only food source is sea ##weed . [SEP]
[CLS] they have adapted to handle salt concentrations that would kill other breeds of sheep . [SEP]
