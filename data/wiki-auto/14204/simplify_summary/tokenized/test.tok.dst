[CLS] halo ##phile ##s are organisms that thrive in high salt concentrations . [SEP]
[CLS] they are a type of ex ##tre ##mo ##phile organism . [SEP]
[CLS] the name comes from the greek word for " salt - loving " . [SEP]
[CLS] while most halo ##phile ##s are classified into the arch ##aea domain , there are also bacterial halo ##phile ##s and some eu ##kar ##yo ##ta , such as the al ##ga " dun ##ali ##ella sal ##ina " or fungus " wall ##emia ich ##thy ##op ##ha ##ga " . [SEP]
[CLS] some well - known species give off a red color from car ##ote ##no ##id compounds , notably ba ##cter ##ior ##ho ##do ##ps ##in . [SEP]
[CLS] halo ##phile ##s can be found anywhere with a concentration of salt five times greater than the salt concentration of the ocean , such as the great salt lake in utah , owens lake in california , the dead sea , and in eva ##por ##ation ponds . [SEP]
[CLS] halo ##phile ##s are categorized as slight , moderate , or extreme , by the extent of their halo ##to ##ler ##ance . [SEP]
[CLS] slight halo ##phile ##s prefer 0 . 3 to 0 . 8 m ( 1 . 7 to 4 . 8 % — sea ##water is 0 . 6 m or 3 . 5 % ) , moderate halo ##phile ##s 0 . 8 to 3 . 4 m ( 4 . 7 to 20 % ) , and extreme halo ##phile ##s 3 . 4 to 5 . 1 m ( 20 to 30 % ) salt content . [SEP]
[CLS] halo ##phile ##s require sodium chloride ( salt ) for growth , in contrast to halo ##to ##ler ##ant organisms , which do not require salt but can grow under saline conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] high sal ##ini ##ty represents an extreme environment to which relatively few organisms have been able to adapt and occupy . [SEP]
[CLS] most halo ##phi ##lic and all halo ##to ##ler ##ant organisms ex ##pen ##d energy to exclude salt from their cy ##top ##las ##m to avoid protein aggregation ( ' salt ##ing out ' ) . [SEP]
[CLS] to survive the high sal ##ini ##ties , halo ##phile ##s employ two differing strategies to prevent des ##ic ##cation through os ##mot ##ic movement of water out of their cy ##top ##las ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] both strategies work by increasing the internal os ##mo ##lar ##ity of the cell . [SEP]
[CLS] in the first ( which is employed by the majority of halo ##phi ##lic bacteria , some arch ##aea , yeast ##s , algae and fungi ) , organic compounds are accumulated in the cy ##top ##las ##m — os ##mo ##pro ##tec ##tan ##ts which are known as compatible sol ##ute ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] these can be either synthesis ##ed or accumulated from the environment . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common compatible sol ##ute ##s are neutral or z ##wi ##tter ##ion ##ic , and include amino acids , sugar ##s , poly ##ols , beta ##ines , and ec ##to ##ines , as well as derivatives of some of these compounds . [SEP]
[CLS] the second , more radical adaptation involves the selective influx of potassium ( k ) ions into the cy ##top ##las ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] this adaptation is restricted to the moderately halo ##phi ##lic bacterial order hal ##ana ##ero ##bial ##es , the extremely halo ##phi ##lic arch ##aea ##l family halo ##ba ##cter ##iaceae , and the extremely halo ##phi ##lic bacterium " sal ##ini ##ba ##cter rub ##er " . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence of this adaptation in three distinct evolutionary lineage ##s suggests converge ##nt evolution of this strategy , it being unlikely to be an ancient characteristic retained in only scattered groups or passed on through massive lateral gene transfer . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary reason for this is the entire intra ##cellular machinery ( enzymes , structural proteins , etc . ) must be adapted to high salt levels , whereas in the compatible sol ##ute adaptation , little or no adjustment is required to intra ##cellular macro ##mo ##le ##cule ##s ; in fact , the compatible sol ##ute ##s often act as more general stress protect ##ants , as well as just os ##mo ##pro ##tec ##tan ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] of particular note are the extreme halo ##phile ##s or halo ##ar ##cha ##ea ( often known as halo ##ba ##cter ##ia ) , a group of arch ##aea , which require at least a 2 m salt concentration and are usually found in saturated solutions ( about 36 % w / v salts ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these are the primary inhabitants of salt lakes , inland seas , and eva ##por ##ating ponds of sea ##water , such as the deep salt ##ern ##s , where they tin ##t the water column and sediments bright colors . [SEP]
[CLS] these species most likely per ##ish if they are exposed to anything other than a very high - concentration , salt - conditioned environment . [SEP]
[CLS] these pro ##kar ##yo ##tes require salt for growth . [SEP]
[CLS] the high concentration of sodium chloride in their environment limits the availability of oxygen for res ##piration . [SEP]
[CLS] their cellular machinery is adapted to high salt concentrations by having charged amino acids on their surfaces , allowing the retention of water molecules around these components . [SEP]
[CLS] they are het ##ero ##tro ##phs that normally res ##pire by aero ##bic means . [SEP]
[CLS] most halo ##phile ##s are unable to survive outside their high - salt native environments . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , many cells are so fragile that when placed in di ##sti ##lled water , they immediately l ##yse from the change in os ##mot ##ic conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] halo ##phile ##s may use a variety of energy sources . [SEP]
[CLS] they can be aero ##bic or ana ##ero ##bic . [SEP]
[CLS] ana ##ero ##bic halo ##phile ##s include photo ##tro ##phic , fe ##rm ##ent ##ative , sulfate - reducing , homo ##ace ##to ##genic , and met ##han ##ogenic species . [SEP]
[CLS] the halo ##ar ##cha ##ea , and particularly the family halo ##ba ##cter ##iaceae , are members of the domain arch ##aea , and comprise the majority of the pro ##kar ##yo ##tic population in hyper ##sal ##ine environments . [SEP]
[CLS] currently , 15 recognised genera are in the family . [SEP]
[CLS] the domain bacteria ( mainly " sal ##ini ##ba ##cter rub ##er " ) can comprise up to 25 % of the pro ##kar ##yo ##tic community , but is more commonly a much lower percentage of the overall population . [SEP]
[CLS] at times , the al ##ga " dun ##ali ##ella sal ##ina " can also pro ##life ##rate in this environment . [SEP]
[CLS] a comparatively wide range of taxa has been isolated from salt ##ern crystal ##lis ##er ponds , including members of these genera : " halo ##fera ##x , halo ##ge ##ometric ##um , halo ##co ##ccus , halo ##ter ##ri ##gen ##a , halo ##ru ##br ##um , halo ##ar ##cula " , and " halo ##ba ##cter ##ium " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the viable counts in these cultivation studies have been small when compared to total counts , and the numerical significance of these isolate ##s has been unclear . [SEP]
[CLS] only recently has it become possible to determine the identities and relative abundance ##s of organisms in natural populations , typically using pc ##r - based strategies that target 16 ##s small subunit rib ##osomal rib ##on ##uc ##lei ##c acid ( 16 ##s rr ##na ) genes . [SEP]
[CLS] while comparatively few studies of this type have been performed , results from these suggest that some of the most readily isolated and studied genera may not in fact be significant in the " in situ " community . [SEP]
[CLS] this is seen in cases such as the genus " halo ##ar ##cula " , which is estimated to make up less than 0 . 1 % of the " in situ " community , but commonly appears in isolation studies . [SEP]
[CLS] the comparative gen ##omic and pro ##te ##omic analysis showed distinct molecular signatures exist for environmental adaptation of halo ##phile ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] at the protein level , the halo ##phi ##lic species are characterized by low hydro ##phobic ##ity , over ##re ##pres ##entation of acidic residues , under ##re ##pres ##entation of cy ##s , lower prop ##ens ##ities for helix formation , and higher prop ##ens ##ities for coil structure . [SEP]
[CLS] the core of these proteins is less hydro ##phobic , such as dh ##fr , that was found to have narrower β - strands . [SEP]
[CLS] at the dna level , the halo ##phile ##s exhibit distinct din ##uc ##le ##otide and cod ##on usage . [SEP]
[CLS] " halo ##ba ##cter ##ium " is a genus of the arch ##aea that has a high tolerance for elevated levels of sal ##ini ##ty . [SEP]
[CLS] some species of halo ##ba ##cter ##ia have acidic proteins that resist the den ##at ##uring effects of salts . [SEP]
[CLS] " halo ##co ##ccus " is a specific genus of the family halo ##ba ##cter ##iaceae . [SEP]
[CLS] some hyper ##sal ##ine lakes are a habitat to numerous families of halo ##phile ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the ma ##k ##ga ##di ##k ##ga ##di pan ##s in botswana form a vast , seasonal , high - sal ##ini ##ty water body that manifest ##s halo ##phi ##lic species within the dia ##tom genus " ni ##tz ##sch ##ia " in the family ba ##ci ##llar ##iaceae , as well as species within the genus " love ##nu ##la " in the family dia ##pt ##omi ##dae . [SEP]
[CLS] owens lake in california also contains a large population of the halo ##phi ##lic bacterium " halo ##ba ##cter ##ium halo ##bi ##um " . [SEP]
[CLS] " wall ##emia ich ##thy ##op ##ha ##ga " is a bas ##idi ##omy ##ce ##tou ##s fungus , which requires at least 1 . 5 m sodium chloride for " in vitro " growth , and it thrive ##s even in media saturated with salt . [SEP]
[CLS] ob ##liga ##te requirement for salt is an exception in fungi . [SEP]
[CLS] even species that can tolerate salt concentrations close to sat ##uration ( for example " ho ##rta ##ea we ##rne ##cki ##i " ) in almost all cases grow well in standard micro ##bio ##logical media without the addition of salt . [SEP]
[CLS] the fe ##rm ##entation of salty foods ( such as soy sauce , chinese fe ##rm ##ented beans , salt ##ed cod , salt ##ed an ##cho ##vies , sa ##uer ##kra ##ut , etc . ) often involves halo ##ba ##cter ##ia , as either essential ingredients or accidental con ##tam ##ina ##nts . [SEP]
[CLS] one example is " ch ##rom ##oh ##alo ##ba ##cter bei ##jer ##in ##cki ##i " , found in salt ##ed beans preserved in br ##ine and in salt ##ed herring . [SEP]
[CLS] " te ##tra ##gen ##oco ##ccus halo ##phi ##lus " is found in salt ##ed an ##cho ##vies and soy sauce . [SEP]
[CLS] " arte ##mia " is a ubiquitous genus of small halo ##phi ##lic crust ##ace ##ans living in salt lakes ( such as great salt lake ) and solar salt ##ern ##s that can exist in water approaching the precipitation point of na ##cl , 340 g l ##−1 and can withstand strong os ##mot ##ic shocks thanks to its mit ##iga ##ting strategies for flu ##ct ##uating sal ##ini ##ty levels , such as its unique la ##rval salt gland and os ##more ##gul ##atory capacity . [SEP]
[CLS] north ronald ##say sheep are a breed of sheep originating from or ##kney , scotland . [SEP]
[CLS] they have limited access to fresh water sources on the island and to their only food source is sea ##weed . [SEP]
[CLS] they have adapted to handle salt concentrations that would kill other breeds of sheep . [SEP]
