[CLS] the family alligator ##idae of cr ##oco ##dy ##lian ##s includes alligator ##s and cai ##mans . [SEP]
[CLS] the superfamily alligator ##oid ##ea includes all cr ##oco ##di ##lian ##s ( fossil and extant ) that are more closely related to the american alligator than to either the nile crocodile or the g ##hari ##al . [SEP]
[CLS] members of this superfamily first arose in the late cretaceous . [SEP]
[CLS] " lei ##dy ##os ##uch ##us " of alberta is the earliest known genus . [SEP]
[CLS] fossil alligator ##oids have been found throughout eu ##rasia as land bridges across both the north atlantic and the be ##ring strait have connected north america to eu ##rasia during the cretaceous , pale ##ogen ##e , and neo ##gen ##e periods . [SEP]
[CLS] alligator ##s and cai ##mans split in north america during the late cretaceous and the latter reached south america by the pale ##ogen ##e , before the closure of the ist ##hm ##us of panama during the neo ##gen ##e period . [SEP]
[CLS] the chinese alligator likely descended from a lineage that crossed the be ##ring land bridge during the neo ##gen ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] the modern american alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the pleistocene . [SEP]
[CLS] the alligator ' s full mitochondrial genome was sequence ##d in the 1990s and it suggests the animal evolved at a rate similar to mammals and greater than birds and most cold - blooded ve ##rte ##brates . [SEP]
[CLS] the full genome , published in 2014 , suggests that the alligator evolved much more slowly than mammals and birds . [SEP]
[CLS] the lineage including alligator ##s proper ( alligator ##inae ) occurs in the flu ##vial deposits of the age of the upper chalk in europe , where they did not die out until the pl ##io ##cene age . [SEP]
[CLS] the true alligator ##s are today represented by two species , " a . mississippi ##ensis " in the southeastern united states , which can grow to 15 ft ( 4 . 6 m ) and weigh 1000 lbs ( 45 ##3 kg ) and the small " a . sin ##ensis " in the yang ##tze river , china , which grows to an average of 5 ft ( 1 . 5 m ) . [SEP]
[CLS] their name derives from the spanish " el la ##gart ##o " , which means " the lizard " . [SEP]
[CLS] in central and south america , the alligator family is represented by six species of the subfamily cai ##mani ##nae , which differ from the alligator by the absence of a bony sept ##um between the nostrils , and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony sc ##ute ##s , each of which is formed of two parts united by a su ##ture . [SEP]
[CLS] besides the three species in " cai ##man " , the smooth - fronted cai ##mans in genus " pale ##os ##uch ##us " and the black cai ##man in " mel ##ano ##su ##chus " are described . [SEP]
[CLS] cai ##mans tend to be more agile and crocodile - like in their movements , and have longer , sharpe ##r teeth than alligator ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] " c . cr ##oco ##di ##lus " , the spectacle ##d cai ##man , has the wide ##st distribution , from southern mexico to the northern half of argentina , and grows to a modest size of about 2 . 2 m . [SEP]
[CLS] the largest is the near - threatened " mel ##ano ##su ##chus niger " , the " ja ##care - ass ##u " or large or black cai ##man of the amazon river basin . [SEP]
[CLS] black cai ##mans grow to 16 . 5 ft , with the largest recorded size 5 . 79 m . [SEP]
[CLS] the black cai ##man and american alligator are the only members of the alligator family that pose the same danger to humans as the larger species of the crocodile family . [SEP]
[CLS] although cai ##mans have not been studied in depth , scientists have learned their mating cycles ( previously thought to be spontaneous or year - round ) are linked to the rainfall cycles and the river levels , which increases chances of survival for their offspring . [SEP]
[CLS] alligator ##s differ from crocodile ##s principally in having wider and shorter heads , with more ob ##tus ##e snout ##s ; in having the fourth , enlarged tooth of the under jaw received , not into an external notch , but into a pit formed for it within the upper one ; in lacking a jagged fringe which appears on the hind legs and feet of the crocodile ; in having the toes of the hind feet webb ##ed not more than half way to the tips ; and a difference in habitat , alligator ##s generally being found in fresh water ( though they have been found in salt marshes as well ) , while crocodile ##s can tolerate salt water due to specialized glands for filtering out salt . [SEP]
[CLS] in general , crocodile ##s tend to be more dangerous to humans than alligator ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] another recently discovered trait is that of both cai ##mans and american alligator ##s part ##aking of foliage and fruit in addition to their normal diet of fish and meat . [SEP]
