[CLS] thrust is a reaction force described quantitative ##ly by newton ' s third law . [SEP]
[CLS] when a system ex ##pel ##s or accelerate ##s mass in one direction , the accelerated mass will cause a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on that system . [SEP]
[CLS] the force applied on a surface in a direction perpendicular or normal to the surface is also called thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] force , and thus thrust , is measured using the international system of units ( si ) in newton ##s ( symbol : n ) , and represents the amount needed to accelerate 1 ki ##logram of mass at the rate of 1 meter per second per second . [SEP]
[CLS] in mechanical engineering , force orthogonal to the main load ( such as in parallel he ##lica ##l gears ) is referred to as thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] a fixed - wing aircraft generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight . [SEP]
[CLS] this can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a propeller , or a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine , or by e ##ject ##ing hot gases from a rocket engine . [SEP]
[CLS] the forward thrust is proportional to the mass of the airs ##tream multiplied by the difference in velocity of the airs ##tream . [SEP]
[CLS] reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by rev ##ers ##ing the pitch of variable - pitch propeller blades , or using a thrust reverse ##r on a jet engine . [SEP]
[CLS] rotary wing aircraft and thrust vector ##ing v / st ##ol aircraft use engine thrust to support the weight of the aircraft , and vector sum of this thrust fore and aft to control forward speed . [SEP]
[CLS] a motor ##boat generates thrust ( or reverse thrust ) when the propellers are turned to accelerate water backwards ( or forwards ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the resulting thrust pushes the boat in the opposite direction to the sum of the momentum change in the water flowing through the propeller . [SEP]
[CLS] a rocket is propelled forward by a thrust force equal in magnitude , but opposite in direction , to the time - rate of momentum change of the exhaust gas accelerated from the combustion chamber through the rocket engine no ##zzle . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the exhaust velocity with respect to the rocket , times the time - rate at which the mass is expelled , or in mathematical terms : where t is the thrust generated ( force ) , formula _ 2 is the rate of change of mass with respect to time ( mass flow rate of exhaust ) , and v is the speed of the exhaust gases measured relative to the rocket . [SEP]
[CLS] for vertical launch of a rocket the initial thrust at lift ##off must be more than the weight . [SEP]
[CLS] each of the three space shuttle main engines could produce a thrust of 1 . 8 megan ##ew ##ton , and each of the space shuttle ' s two solid rocket booster ##s 14 . 7 mn , together 29 . 4 mn . [SEP]
[CLS] by contrast , the simplified aid for eva rescue ( safer ) has 24 thrust ##ers of 3 . 56 n each . [SEP]
[CLS] in the air - breathing category , the am ##t - usa at - 180 jet engine developed for radio - controlled aircraft produce 90 n ( 20 lb ##f ) of thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] the ge ##90 - 115 ##b engine fitted on the boeing 77 ##7 - 300 ##er , recognized by the guinness book of world records as the " world ' s most powerful commercial jet engine , " has a thrust of 56 ##9 kn ( 127 , 900 lb ##f ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the power needed to generate thrust and the force of the thrust can be related in a non - linear way . [SEP]
[CLS] note that these calculations are only valid for when the incoming air is accelerated from a stands ##till – for example when hovering . [SEP]
[CLS] the inverse of the proportional ##ity constant , the " efficiency " of an otherwise - perfect thrust ##er , is proportional to the area of the cross section of the propelled volume of fluid ( formula _ 8 ) and the density of the fluid ( formula _ 9 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this helps to explain why moving through water is easier and why aircraft have much larger propellers than water ##craft . [SEP]
[CLS] a very common question is how to compare the thrust rating of a jet engine with the power rating of a piston engine . [SEP]
[CLS] such comparison is difficult , as these quantities are not equivalent . [SEP]
[CLS] a piston engine does not move the aircraft by itself ( the propeller does that ) , so piston engines are usually rated by how much power they deliver to the propeller . [SEP]
[CLS] except for changes in temperature and air pressure , this quantity depends basically on the throttle setting . [SEP]
[CLS] a jet engine has no propeller , so the prop ##ulsive power of a jet engine is determined from its thrust as follows . [SEP]
[CLS] in case of a rocket or a jet aircraft , the force is exactly the thrust ( t ) produced by the engine . [SEP]
[CLS] this formula looks very surprising , but it is correct : the " prop ##ulsive power " ( or " power available " ) of a jet engine increases with its speed . [SEP]
[CLS] if the speed is zero , then the prop ##ulsive power is zero . [SEP]
[CLS] if a jet aircraft is at full throttle but attached to a static test stand , then the jet engine produces no prop ##ulsive power , however thrust is still produced . [SEP]
[CLS] compare that to a piston engine . [SEP]
[CLS] the combination piston engine – propeller also has a prop ##ulsive power with exactly the same formula , and it will also be zero at zero speed – but that is for the engine – propeller set . [SEP]
[CLS] the engine alone will continue to produce its rated power at a constant rate , whether the aircraft is moving or not . [SEP]
[CLS] now , imagine the strong chain is broken , and the jet and the piston aircraft start to move . [SEP]
[CLS] at low speeds : the piston engine will have constant 100 % power , and the propeller ' s thrust will vary with speed the jet engine will have constant 100 % thrust , and the engine ' s power will vary with speed if a powered aircraft is generating thrust t and experiencing drag d , the difference between the two , t − d , is termed the excess thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] the instant ##aneous performance of the aircraft is mostly dependent on the excess thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] excess thrust is a vector and is determined as the vector difference between the thrust vector and the drag vector . [SEP]
[CLS] the thrust axis for an airplane is the line of action of the total thrust at any instant . [SEP]
[CLS] it depends on the location , number , and characteristics of the jet engines or propellers . [SEP]
[CLS] it usually differs from the drag axis . [SEP]
[CLS] if so , the distance between the thrust axis and the drag axis will cause a moment that must be resisted by a change in the aerodynamic force on the horizontal stab ##ilis ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] notably , the boeing 737 max , with larger , lower - slung engines than previous 737 models , had a greater distance between the thrust axis and the drag axis , causing the nose to rise up in some flight regimes , nec ##ess ##itating a pitch - control system , mca ##s . [SEP]
