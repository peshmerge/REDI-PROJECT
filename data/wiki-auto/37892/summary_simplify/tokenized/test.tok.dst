[CLS] when a system ex ##pel ##s or accelerate ##s mass in one direction , the accelerated mass will cause a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on that system . [SEP]
[CLS] force , and thus thrust , is measured using the international system of units ( si ) in newton ##s ( symbol : n ) , and represents the amount needed to accelerate 1 ki ##logram of mass at the rate of 1 meter per second per second . [SEP]
[CLS] in mechanical engineering , force orthogonal to the main load ( such as in parallel he ##lica ##l gears ) is referred to as thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] a fixed - wing aircraft generates forward thrust when air is pushed in the direction opposite to flight . [SEP]
[CLS] this can be done in several ways including by the spinning blades of a propeller , or a rotating fan pushing air out from the back of a jet engine , or by e ##ject ##ing hot gases from a rocket engine . [SEP]
[CLS] the forward thrust is proportional to the mass of the airs ##tream multiplied by the difference in velocity of the airs ##tream . [SEP]
[CLS] reverse thrust can be generated to aid braking after landing by rev ##ers ##ing the pitch of variable - pitch propeller blades , or using a thrust reverse ##r on a jet engine . [SEP]
[CLS] a rocket is propelled forward by a thrust force equal in magnitude , but opposite in direction , to the time - rate of momentum change of the exhaust gas accelerated from the combustion chamber through the rocket engine no ##zzle . [SEP]
[CLS] each of the three space shuttle main engines could produce a thrust of 1 . 8 megan ##ew ##ton , and each of the space shuttle ' s two solid rocket booster ##s 14 . 7 mn , together 29 . 4 mn . [SEP]
[CLS] in the air - breathing category , the am ##t - usa at - 180 jet engine developed for radio - controlled aircraft produce 90 n ( 20 lb ##f ) of thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] the power needed to generate thrust and the force of the thrust can be related in a non - linear way . [SEP]
[CLS] note that these calculations are only valid for when the incoming air is accelerated from a stands ##till – for example when hovering . [SEP]
[CLS] the inverse of the proportional ##ity constant , the " efficiency " of an otherwise - perfect thrust ##er , is proportional to the area of the cross section of the propelled volume of fluid ( formula _ 8 ) and the density of the fluid ( formula _ 9 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a piston engine does not move the aircraft by itself ( the propeller does that ) , so piston engines are usually rated by how much power they deliver to the propeller . [SEP]
[CLS] except for changes in temperature and air pressure , this quantity depends basically on the throttle setting . [SEP]
[CLS] a jet engine has no propeller , so the prop ##ulsive power of a jet engine is determined from its thrust as follows . [SEP]
[CLS] in case of a rocket or a jet aircraft , the force is exactly the thrust ( t ) produced by the engine . [SEP]
[CLS] if a jet aircraft is at full throttle but attached to a static test stand , then the jet engine produces no prop ##ulsive power , however thrust is still produced . [SEP]
[CLS] the engine alone will continue to produce its rated power at a constant rate , whether the aircraft is moving or not . [SEP]
[CLS] at low speeds : the piston engine will have constant 100 % power , and the propeller ' s thrust will vary with speed the jet engine will have constant 100 % thrust , and the engine ' s power will vary with speed if a powered aircraft is generating thrust t and experiencing drag d , the difference between the two , t − d , is termed the excess thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] it depends on the location , number , and characteristics of the jet engines or propellers . [SEP]
[CLS] if so , the distance between the thrust axis and the drag axis will cause a moment that must be resisted by a change in the aerodynamic force on the horizontal stab ##ilis ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] notably , the boeing 737 max , with larger , lower - slung engines than previous 737 models , had a greater distance between the thrust axis and the drag axis , causing the nose to rise up in some flight regimes , nec ##ess ##itating a pitch - control system , mca ##s . [SEP]
