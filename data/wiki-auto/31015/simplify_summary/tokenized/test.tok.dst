[CLS] however , paul mccann of " the independent " defended this aspect of the show , stating that " " tel ##et ##ub ##bies " upset ##s those who automatically assume that progressive and creative learning is trend ##y nonsense . [SEP]
[CLS] those who believe that education should be strictly disciplined and functional , even when you ' re 18 months old . [SEP]
[CLS] thankfully " tel ##et ##ub ##bies " isn ' t for them . [SEP]
[CLS] a controversy began in 1999 related to tin ##ky wink ##y and his carrying a bag that looks much like a woman ' s hand ##bag ( although he was first " out ##ed " by the academic and cultural critic andy med ##hurst in a letter of july 1997 to " the face " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] he aroused the interest of jerry fa ##l ##well in 1999 when fa ##l ##well alleged that the character was a " gay role model " . [SEP]
[CLS] fa ##l ##well issued an attack in his " national liberty journal " , citing a " washington post " " in / out " column which stated that lesbian comedian ellen de ##gen ##eres was " out " as the chief national gay representative , while trend ##y tin ##ky wink ##y was " in " . [SEP]
[CLS] he warned parents that tin ##ky wink ##y could be a covert homosexual symbol , because " he is purple , the gay pride colour , and his antenna is shaped like a triangle : the gay pride symbol . " [SEP]
[CLS] the bbc made an official response , explaining that " tin ##ky wink ##y is simply a sweet , technological baby with a magic bag . " [SEP]
[CLS] ken vis ##elman of its ##y - bits ##y entertainment commented , " he ' s not gay . [SEP]
[CLS] he ' s just a character in a children ' s series . " [SEP]
[CLS] in may 2007 , polish om ##bu ##ds ##man for children , e ##wa so ##win ##ska revisited the matter , and planned to order an investigation . [SEP]
[CLS] " i noticed that he has a woman ' s hand ##bag , but i didn ' t realise he ' s a boy , " so ##win ##ska said in a public statement . [SEP]
[CLS] she asked her office ' s psychologists to look into the allegations . [SEP]
[CLS] after the research in late 2007 , she stated : " the opinion of a leading sex ##ologist , who maintains that this series has no negative effects on a child ' s psychology , is perfectly credible . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result i have decided that it is no longer necessary to seek the opinion of other psychologists . " [SEP]
[CLS] despite the objections , the " independent on sunday " ' s editors included tin ##ky wink ##y as the only fictional character in the 2008 inaugural " happy list " , alongside 99 real - life adults recognised for making britain a better and happier place . [SEP]
[CLS] although the programme is aimed at children between the ages of one and four , it had a substantial cult following with older generations , mainly university and college students . [SEP]
[CLS] the mixture of bright colours , unusual designs , repetitive non - verbal dialogue , ritual ##istic format , and occasional for ##ays into physical comedy appealed to many who perceived the programme as having psychedelic qualities . [SEP]
[CLS] adam roberts suggests that " tel ##et ##ub ##bies " constitutes an example of radical utopia ##n fiction . [SEP]
[CLS] in this reading , the tel ##et ##ub ##bies are an advanced culture which has eliminated all need to work , worry , or struggle in any way , and reg ##ressed into a child ##like state . [SEP]
[CLS] roberts positions the tel ##et ##ub ##bies as the end ##point of the science - fictional idea of paradise based on infant ##ilis ##ation – a more extreme version of the future humans in aldo ##us hu ##xley ' s " brave new world " and the el ##oi in h . g . wells ' s " the time machine " ( who are mentally child ##like , but still physically and sexually adult ) . [SEP]
[CLS] following si ##gm ##und freud ' s insight that adult pleasure must media ##te id and super - ego – gr ##ati ##fication and anxiety – the only way to attain a completely stress - free life is to surrender the super - ego , including sex . [SEP]
[CLS] it follows that the broadcasts shown on the tel ##et ##ub ##bies ' in - set television ##s are historical documentaries suggesting infant ##ile existence as the paradigm , with the baby in the sun likely being the society ' s central machine intelligence . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , the todd ##ler - oriented aspect of the show can be read not in cl ##ums ##ily production - intention terms ( ‘ the show is designed to appeal to todd ##lers ’ ) , but as a commentary upon the necessary infant ##ilis ##ation implicit in any utopia ##n fantasy . [SEP]
[CLS] it poses a question : to achieve a total happiness for all on the planet , once technology has removed the practical barriers , how far along the road towards infant ##ile consciousness will it be necessary to travel ? [SEP]
[CLS] will we become like the citizens of hu ##xley ’ s brave new world ? [SEP]
[CLS] or more infant ##ile , like wells ’ s el ##oi ? [SEP]
[CLS] or will we go the whole hog , and sub ##sume our ang ##st - ridden adult consciousness ##es completely in the bright colours and satisfying repetition ##s of tel ##et ##ub ##by ##land ? [SEP]
[CLS] the enduring appeal of the tel ##et ##ub ##bies to adults suggests , perhaps , this latter . " [SEP]
[CLS] in december 1997 , bbc worldwide released a cd single from the series , based on the show ' s theme song , called " tel ##et ##ub ##bies say ' eh - oh ! ' " [SEP]
[CLS] it is the only single from " tel ##et ##ub ##bies " , making the characters a one - hit wonder in the united kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] the song was written by andrew mcc ##ror ##ie - shan ##d and andrew davenport , and produced by mcc ##ror ##ie - shan ##d and steve james . [SEP]
[CLS] the single reached number 1 in the uk singles chart in december 1997 , and remained in the top 75 for 32 weeks after its release . [SEP]
[CLS] in december 2017 , tel ##et ##ub ##bies play time was released worldwide for mobile devices by built games . [SEP]
