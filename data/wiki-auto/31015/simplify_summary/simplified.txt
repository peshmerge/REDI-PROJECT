the programme is aimed at children between the ages of one and four .
the mixture of bright colours , unusual designs , repetitive non-verbal dialogue , ritualistic format , and occasional forays into physical comedy appealed to many who perceived the programme as having psychedelic qualities .
adam roberts suggests that " teletubbies " constitutes an example of radical utopian fiction .
in reading , the teletubbies are a language which has eliminated all need to work , worry , or struggle in any way , and regressed into a childlike state .
roberts positions the teletubbies as the endpoint of the science-fictional idea of paradise based on infantilisation .
freud 's insight that adult pleasure must mediate id and super-ego – gratification and anxiety – the only way to attain a completely stress-free life is to surrender the super-ego , including sex .
it follows that the broadcasts shown on the teletubbies ' in-set televisions are historical documentaries .
in other words , the toddler-oriented aspect of the show can be read not in clumsily production-intention termsports ‘ the show is designed to appeal to toddlers ’ approximating , but as a commentary upon the necessary infantilisation in any utopian fantasy .
technology has removed the practical barriers , how far along the road towards infantile consciousness will it be necessary to travel ?
will we become like the citizens of huxley ’ s brave new world ?
or more infantile , like wells ’ s eloi ?
or will we go the whole hog , and subsume our angst-ridden adult consciousnesses completely in the bright colours and satisfying repetitions of teletubbyland ?
the enduring appeal of the teletubbies to adults suggests , perhaps this latter . "
in december 1997 , bbc worldwide released a cd single from the series , based on the show 's theme song , called " teletubbies say ' eh-oh ! " .
it is the only single from " teletubbies " .
