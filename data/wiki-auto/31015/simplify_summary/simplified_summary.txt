or will we go the whole hog , and subsume our angst-ridden adult consciousnesses completely in the bright colours and satisfying repetitions of teletubbyland ?
in december 1997 , bbc worldwide released a cd single from the series , based on the show 's theme song , called " teletubbies say ' eh-oh ! "
