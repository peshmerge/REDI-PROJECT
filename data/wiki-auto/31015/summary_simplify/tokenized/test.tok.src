[CLS] adam roberts suggests that " tel ##et ##ub ##bies " constitutes an example of radical utopia ##n fiction . [SEP]
[CLS] in this reading , the tel ##et ##ub ##bies are an advanced culture which has eliminated all need to work , worry , or struggle in any way , and reg ##ressed into a child ##like state . [SEP]
[CLS] roberts positions the tel ##et ##ub ##bies as the end ##point of the science - fictional idea of paradise based on infant ##ilis ##ation – a more extreme version of the future humans in aldo ##us hu ##xley ' s " brave new world " and the el ##oi in h . g . wells ' s " the time machine " ( who are mentally child ##like , but still physically and sexually adult ) . [SEP]
[CLS] following si ##gm ##und freud ' s insight that adult pleasure must media ##te id and super - ego – gr ##ati ##fication and anxiety – the only way to attain a completely stress - free life is to surrender the super - ego , including sex . [SEP]
[CLS] it follows that the broadcasts shown on the tel ##et ##ub ##bies ' in - set television ##s are historical documentaries suggesting infant ##ile existence as the paradigm , with the baby in the sun likely being the society ' s central machine intelligence . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , the todd ##ler - oriented aspect of the show can be read not in cl ##ums ##ily production - intention terms ( ‘ the show is designed to appeal to todd ##lers ’ ) , but as a commentary upon the necessary infant ##ilis ##ation implicit in any utopia ##n fantasy . [SEP]
[CLS] it poses a question : to achieve a total happiness for all on the planet , once technology has removed the practical barriers , how far along the road towards infant ##ile consciousness will it be necessary to travel ? [SEP]
[CLS] or will we go the whole hog , and sub ##sume our ang ##st - ridden adult consciousness ##es completely in the bright colours and satisfying repetition ##s of tel ##et ##ub ##by ##land ? [SEP]
[CLS] it is the only single from " tel ##et ##ub ##bies " , making the characters a one - hit wonder in the united kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] the single reached number 1 in the uk singles chart in december 1997 , and remained in the top 75 for 32 weeks after its release . [SEP]
