[CLS] a sign is an object , quality , event , or entity whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else . [SEP]
[CLS] a natural sign bears a causal relation to its object — for instance , thunder is a sign of storm , or medical symptoms sign ##ify a disease . [SEP]
[CLS] a conventional sign signifies by agreement , as a full stop signifies the end of a sentence ; similarly the words and expressions of a language , as well as bodily gestures , can be regarded as signs , expressing particular meanings . [SEP]
[CLS] the physical objects most commonly referred to as signs ( notices , road signs , etc . , collectively known as signage ) generally inform or ins ##truct using written text , symbols , pictures or a combination of these . [SEP]
[CLS] the philosophical study of signs and symbols is called semi ##otic ##s ; this includes the study of semi ##osis , which is the way in which signs ( in the semi ##otic sense ) operate . [SEP]
[CLS] semi ##otic ##s , ep ##iste ##mology , logic , and philosophy of language are concerned about the nature of signs , what they are and how they sign ##ify . [SEP]
[CLS] the nature of signs and symbols and sign ##ification ##s , their definition , elements , and types , is mainly established by aristotle , augustine , and a ##quin ##as . [SEP]
[CLS] according to these classic sources , significance is a relationship between two sorts of things : signs and the kinds of things they sign ##ify ( intend , express or mean ) , where one term necessarily causes something else to come to the mind . [SEP]
[CLS] distinguishing natural signs and conventional signs , the traditional theory of signs ( augustine ) sets the following three ##fold partition of things : all sorts of indications , evidence ##s , symptoms , and physical signals , there are signs which are " always " signs ( the entities of the mind as ideas and images , thoughts and feelings , construct ##s and intentions ) ; and there are signs that " have " to get their sign ##ification ( as linguistic entities and cultural symbols ) . [SEP]
[CLS] so , while natural signs serve as the source of sign ##ification , the human mind is the agency through which signs sign ##ify naturally occurring things , such as objects , states , qualities , quantities , events , processes , or relationships . [SEP]
[CLS] human language and discourse , communication , philosophy , science , logic , mathematics , poetry , theology , and religion are only some of fields of human study and activity where grasping the nature of signs and symbols and patterns of sign ##ification may have a decisive value . [SEP]
[CLS] communication takes place without words but via the mind as a result of signs and symbols ; they communicate / pass across / messages to the human mind through their pictorial representation . [SEP]
[CLS] st . augustine was the first man who synthesized the classical and hellenistic theories of signs . [SEP]
[CLS] for him a sign is a thing which is used to sign ##ify other things and to make them come to mind ( " de doc ##tri ##na christian ##a " ( here ##af ##ter dd ##c ) 1 . 2 . 2 ; 2 . 1 . 1 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common signs are spoken and written words ( dd ##c 1 . 2 . 2 ; 2 . 3 . 4 - 2 . 4 . 5 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] although god cannot be fully express ##ible , augustine gave emphasis to the possibility of god ’ s communication with humans by signs in scripture ( dd ##c 1 . 6 . 6 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] augustine endorsed and developed the classical and hellenistic theories of signs . [SEP]
[CLS] among the mainstream in the theories of signs , i . e . , that of aristotle and that of st ##oic ##s , the former theory filtered into the works of cicero ( 106 - 43 bc , " de invention ##e rhetoric ##a " 1 . 30 . 47 - 48 ) and qui ##nti ##lian ( circa 35 - 100 , " institut ##io or ##ator ##ia " 5 . 9 . 9 - 10 ) , which regarded the sign as an instrument of inference . [SEP]
[CLS] in his commentary on aristotle ’ s " de interpretation ##e " , am ##mon ##ius said , " according to the division of the philosopher theo ##ph ##ras ##tus , the relation of speech is two ##fold , first in regard to the audience , to which speech signifies something , and secondly in regard to the things about which the speaker intends to persuade the audience . " [SEP]
[CLS] if we match dd ##c with this division , the first part belongs to dd ##c book iv and the second part to dd ##c books i - iii . [SEP]
[CLS] augustine , although influenced by these theories , advanced his own theological theory of signs , with whose help one can in ##fer the mind of god from the events and words of scripture . [SEP]
[CLS] books ii and iii of dd ##c en ##ume ##rate all kinds of signs and explain how to interpret them . [SEP]
[CLS] signs are divided into natural ( " natural ##ia " ) and conventional ( " data " ) ; the latter is divided into animal ( " best ##iae " ) and human ( " ho ##mine ##s " ) ; the latter is divided into non - words ( " ce ##tera " ) and words ( " verb ##a " ) ; the latter is divided into spoken words ( " vo ##ces " ) and written words ( " litter ##ae " ) ; the latter is divided into unknown signs ( " sign ##a ign ##ota " ) and ambiguous signs ( " sign ##a am ##bi ##gua " ) ; both the former and the latter are divided respectively into particular signs ( " sign ##a prop ##ria " ) and figurative signs ( " sign ##a trans ##lat ##a " ) , among which the unknown figurative signs belong to the pagan ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to ex ##ege ##tical knowledge ( qui ##nti ##lian , " institut ##io or ##ator ##ia " 1 . 4 . 1 - 3 and 1 . 8 . 1 - 21 ) which follows the order of reading ( " le ##ct ##io " ) , textual criticism ( " em ##end ##ati ##o " ) , explanation ( " en ##ar ##rat ##io " ) , and judgment ( " i ##udi ##ci ##um " ) , one needs to know the original language ( hebrew and greek ) and broad background information on scripture ( dd ##c 2 . 9 . 14 - 2 . 40 . 60 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] augustine ’ s understanding of signs includes several her ##men ##eu ##tical pre ##su ##pp ##osition ##s as important factors . [SEP]
[CLS] first , the interpreter should proceed with hum ##ility , because only a humble person can grasp the truth of scripture ( dd ##c 2 . 41 . 62 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] second , the interpreter must have a spirit of active inquiry and should not hesitate to learn and use pagan education for the purpose of leading to christian learning , because all truth is god ’ s truth ( dd ##c 2 . 40 . 60 - 2 . 42 . 63 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] third , the heart of interpreter should be founded , rooted , and built up in love which is the final goal of the entire scriptures ( dd ##c 2 . 42 . 63 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the sign does not function as its own goal , but its purpose lies in its role as a sign ##ification ( " res sign ##ific ##ans " , dd ##c 3 . 9 . 13 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] god gave signs as a means to reveal himself ; christians need to exercise her ##men ##eu ##tical principles in order to understand that divine revelation . [SEP]
[CLS] even if the script ##ural text is obscure , it has meaningful benefits . [SEP]
[CLS] for the obscure text prevents us from falling into pride , triggers our intelligence ( dd ##c 2 . 6 . 7 ) , temper ##s our faith in the history of revelation ( dd ##c 3 . 8 . 12 ) , and ref ##ines our mind to be suitable to the holy mysteries ( dd ##c 4 . 8 . 22 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when interpreting signs , the literal meaning should first be sought , and then the figurative meaning ( dd ##c 3 . 10 . 14 - 3 . 23 . 33 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] augustine suggests the her ##men ##eu ##tical principle that the obscure script ##ural verse is interpreted with the help of plain and simple verses , which formed the doctrine of " script ##ura script ##ura ##e inter ##pres " ( scripture is the interpreter of scripture ) in the reformation era . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , he introduces the seven rules of ty ##con ##ius the dona ##tist to interpret the obscure meaning of the bible , which demonstrates his understanding that all truth belongs to god ( dd ##c 3 . 3 . 42 - 3 . 37 . 56 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to apply augustine ' s her ##men ##eu ##tics of the sign appropriately in modern times , every division of theology must be involved and interdisciplinary approaches must be taken . [SEP]
