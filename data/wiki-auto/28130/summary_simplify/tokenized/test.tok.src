[CLS] a natural sign bears a causal relation to its object — for instance , thunder is a sign of storm , or medical symptoms sign ##ify a disease . [SEP]
[CLS] a conventional sign signifies by agreement , as a full stop signifies the end of a sentence ; similarly the words and expressions of a language , as well as bodily gestures , can be regarded as signs , expressing particular meanings . [SEP]
[CLS] the physical objects most commonly referred to as signs ( notices , road signs , etc . , collectively known as signage ) generally inform or ins ##truct using written text , symbols , pictures or a combination of these . [SEP]
[CLS] semi ##otic ##s , ep ##iste ##mology , logic , and philosophy of language are concerned about the nature of signs , what they are and how they sign ##ify . [SEP]
[CLS] according to these classic sources , significance is a relationship between two sorts of things : signs and the kinds of things they sign ##ify ( intend , express or mean ) , where one term necessarily causes something else to come to the mind . [SEP]
[CLS] distinguishing natural signs and conventional signs , the traditional theory of signs ( augustine ) sets the following three ##fold partition of things : all sorts of indications , evidence ##s , symptoms , and physical signals , there are signs which are " always " signs ( the entities of the mind as ideas and images , thoughts and feelings , construct ##s and intentions ) ; and there are signs that " have " to get their sign ##ification ( as linguistic entities and cultural symbols ) . [SEP]
[CLS] so , while natural signs serve as the source of sign ##ification , the human mind is the agency through which signs sign ##ify naturally occurring things , such as objects , states , qualities , quantities , events , processes , or relationships . [SEP]
[CLS] human language and discourse , communication , philosophy , science , logic , mathematics , poetry , theology , and religion are only some of fields of human study and activity where grasping the nature of signs and symbols and patterns of sign ##ification may have a decisive value . [SEP]
[CLS] communication takes place without words but via the mind as a result of signs and symbols ; they communicate / pass across / messages to the human mind through their pictorial representation . [SEP]
[CLS] st . augustine was the first man who synthesized the classical and hellenistic theories of signs . [SEP]
[CLS] among the mainstream in the theories of signs , i . e . , that of aristotle and that of st ##oic ##s , the former theory filtered into the works of cicero ( 106 - 43 bc , " de invention ##e rhetoric ##a " 1 . 30 . 47 - 48 ) and qui ##nti ##lian ( circa 35 - 100 , " institut ##io or ##ator ##ia " 5 . 9 . 9 - 10 ) , which regarded the sign as an instrument of inference . [SEP]
[CLS] in his commentary on aristotle ’ s " de interpretation ##e " , am ##mon ##ius said , " according to the division of the philosopher theo ##ph ##ras ##tus , the relation of speech is two ##fold , first in regard to the audience , to which speech signifies something , and secondly in regard to the things about which the speaker intends to persuade the audience . " [SEP]
[CLS] augustine , although influenced by these theories , advanced his own theological theory of signs , with whose help one can in ##fer the mind of god from the events and words of scripture . [SEP]
[CLS] second , the interpreter must have a spirit of active inquiry and should not hesitate to learn and use pagan education for the purpose of leading to christian learning , because all truth is god ’ s truth ( dd ##c 2 . 40 . 60 - 2 . 42 . 63 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] third , the heart of interpreter should be founded , rooted , and built up in love which is the final goal of the entire scriptures ( dd ##c 2 . 42 . 63 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] even if the script ##ural text is obscure , it has meaningful benefits . [SEP]
[CLS] for the obscure text prevents us from falling into pride , triggers our intelligence ( dd ##c 2 . 6 . 7 ) , temper ##s our faith in the history of revelation ( dd ##c 3 . 8 . 12 ) , and ref ##ines our mind to be suitable to the holy mysteries ( dd ##c 4 . 8 . 22 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , he introduces the seven rules of ty ##con ##ius the dona ##tist to interpret the obscure meaning of the bible , which demonstrates his understanding that all truth belongs to god ( dd ##c 3 . 3 . 42 - 3 . 37 . 56 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to apply augustine ' s her ##men ##eu ##tics of the sign appropriately in modern times , every division of theology must be involved and interdisciplinary approaches must be taken . [SEP]
