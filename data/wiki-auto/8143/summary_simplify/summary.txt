December got its name from the Latin word "decem" (meaning ten) because it was originally the tenth month of the year in the calendar of Romulus 750 which began in March.
The winter days following December were not included as part of any month.
Later, the months of January and February were created out of the monthless period and added to the beginning of the calendar, but December retained its name.
Dies natalis (birthday) was held at the temple of Tellus on December 13, Consualia was held on December 15, Saturnalia was held December 17–23, Opiconsivia was held on December 19, Divalia was held on December 21, Larentalia was held on December 23, and the dies natalis of Sol Invictus was held on December 25.
December contains the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, the day with the fewest daylight hours, and the summer solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, the day with the most daylight hours (excluding polar regions in both cases).
In the Northern hemisphere, the beginning of the astronomical winter is traditionally 21 December or the date of the solstice.
This shower can also start in November), the Phoenicids (November 29 to December 9, with a peak occurring around 5/6 December), the Quadrantids (typically a January shower but can also start in December), the Sigma Hydrids (December 4–15), and the Ursids (December 17-to December 25/26, peaking around December 22).
