[CLS] abortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fe ##tus before it can survive outside the ut ##erus . [SEP]
[CLS] an abortion that occurs without intervention is known as a mis ##carriage or spontaneous abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] when deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy , it is called an induced abortion , or less frequently " induced mis ##carriage " . [SEP]
[CLS] the un ##mo ##di ##fied word " abortion " generally refers to an induced abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar procedure after the fe ##tus has potential to survive outside the womb is known as a " late termination of pregnancy " or less accurately as a " late term abortion " . [SEP]
[CLS] when properly done , abortion is one of the safe ##st procedures in medicine , but unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal death , especially in the developing world . [SEP]
[CLS] making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths . [SEP]
[CLS] it is safer than childbirth , which has a 14 times higher risk of death in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] modern methods use medication or surgery for abortion ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the drug mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne in combination with pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trim ##ester of pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common surgical technique involves dil ##ating the ce ##r ##vi ##x and using a su ##ction device . [SEP]
[CLS] birth control , such as the pill or intra ##uter ##ine devices , can be used immediately following abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] when performed legally and safely on a woman who desires it , induced abortion ##s do not increase the risk of long - term mental or physical problems . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , unsafe abortion ##s ( those performed by un ##ski ##lled individuals , with hazardous equipment , or in un ##san ##ita ##ry facilities ) cause 47 , 000 deaths and 5 million hospital admissions each year . [SEP]
[CLS] the world health organization recommends safe and legal abortion ##s be available to all women . [SEP]
[CLS] around 56 million abortion ##s are performed each year in the world , with about 45 % done unsafe ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008 , before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased . [SEP]
[CLS] s of 2008 , 40 % of the world ' s women had access to legal abortion ##s without limits as to reason . [SEP]
[CLS] countries that permit abortion ##s have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , abortion ##s have been attempted using herbal medicines , sharp tools , forceful massage , or through other traditional methods . [SEP]
[CLS] abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortion ##s are different around the world . [SEP]
[CLS] in some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape , problems with the fe ##tus , poverty , risk to a woman ' s health , or inc ##est . [SEP]
[CLS] there is debate over the moral , ethical , and legal issues of abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] those who oppose abortion often argue that an embryo or fe ##tus is a human with a right to life , and they may compare abortion to murder . [SEP]
[CLS] those who support the legal ##ity of abortion often hold that it is part of a woman ' s right to make decisions about her own body . [SEP]
[CLS] others favor legal and accessible abortion as a public health measure . [SEP]
[CLS] an induced abortion may be classified as " therapeutic " ( done in response to a health condition of the women or fe ##tus ) or " elect ##ive " ( chosen for other reasons ) . [SEP]
[CLS] approximately 205 million pre ##gnan ##cies occur each year worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] over a third are un ##int ##ended and about a fifth end in induced abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] most abortion ##s result from un ##int ##ended pre ##gnan ##cies . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united kingdom , 1 to 2 % of abortion ##s are done due to genetic problems in the fe ##tus . [SEP]
[CLS] a pregnancy can be intentionally ab ##orted in several ways . [SEP]
[CLS] the manner selected often depends upon the ge ##station ##al age of the embryo or fe ##tus , which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses . [SEP]
[CLS] specific procedures may also be selected due to legal ##ity , regional availability , and doctor or a woman ' s personal preference . [SEP]
[CLS] reasons for pro ##cu ##ring induced abortion ##s are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elect ##ive . [SEP]
[CLS] an abortion is medical ##ly referred to as a therapeutic abortion when it is performed to save the life of the pregnant woman ; to prevent harm to the woman ' s physical or mental health ; to terminate a pregnancy where indications are that the child will have a significantly increased chance of mortality or mor ##bid ##ity ; or to selective ##ly reduce the number of fe ##tus ##es to less ##en health risks associated with multiple pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] an abortion is referred to as an elect ##ive or voluntary abortion when it is performed at the request of the woman for non - medical reasons . [SEP]
[CLS] confusion sometimes arises over the term " elect ##ive " because " elect ##ive surgery " generally refers to all scheduled surgery , whether medical ##ly necessary or not . [SEP]
[CLS] mis ##carriage , also known as spontaneous abortion , is the un ##int ##ent ##ional expulsion of an embryo or fe ##tus before the 24th week of ge ##station . [SEP]
[CLS] a pregnancy that ends before 37 weeks of ge ##station resulting in a live - born infant is a " premature birth " or a " pre ##ter ##m birth " . [SEP]
[CLS] when a fe ##tus dies in ut ##ero after via ##bility , or during delivery , it is usually termed " still ##born " . [SEP]
[CLS] premature births and still ##bir ##ths are generally not considered to be mis ##carriage ##s although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap . [SEP]
[CLS] only 30 % to 50 % of conception ##s progress past the first trim ##ester . [SEP]
[CLS] the vast majority of those that do not progress are lost before the woman is aware of the conception , and many pre ##gnan ##cies are lost before medical practitioners can detect an embryo . [SEP]
[CLS] between 15 % and 30 % of known pre ##gnan ##cies end in clinical ##ly apparent mis ##carriage , depending upon the age and health of the pregnant woman . [SEP]
[CLS] 80 % of these spontaneous abortion ##s happen in the first trim ##ester . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common cause of spontaneous abortion during the first trim ##ester is ch ##rom ##osomal abnormalities of the embryo or fe ##tus , accounting for at least 50 % of sampled early pregnancy losses . [SEP]
[CLS] other causes include vascular disease ( such as lu ##pus ) , diabetes , other ho ##rm ##onal problems , infection , and abnormalities of the ut ##erus . [SEP]
[CLS] advancing maternal age and a woman ' s history of previous spontaneous abortion ##s are the two leading factors associated with a greater risk of spontaneous abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] a spontaneous abortion can also be caused by accidental trauma ; intentional trauma or stress to cause mis ##carriage is considered induced abortion or fe ##tic ##ide . [SEP]
[CLS] medical abortion ##s are those induced by ab ##ort ##if ##ac ##ient pharmaceuticals . [SEP]
[CLS] medical abortion became an alternative method of abortion with the availability of pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in analog ##s in the 1970s and the anti ##pro ##ges ##to ##gen mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne ( also known as ru - 48 ##6 ) in the 1980s . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common early first - trim ##ester medical abortion regime ##ns use mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne in combination with mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l ( or sometimes another pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in analog , gem ##ep ##ros ##t ) up to 10 weeks ( 70 days ) ge ##station ##al age , met ##hot ##re ##xa ##te in combination with a pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in analog up to 7 weeks ge ##station , or a pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in analog alone . [SEP]
[CLS] mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne – mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l combination regime ##ns work faster and are more effective at later ge ##station ##al ages than met ##hot ##re ##xa ##te – mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l combination regime ##ns , and combination regime ##ns are more effective than mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l alone . [SEP]
[CLS] this regime is effective in the second trim ##ester . [SEP]
[CLS] medical abortion regiments involving mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne followed by mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l in the cheek between 24 and 48 hours later are effective when performed before 70 days ' ge ##station . [SEP]
[CLS] in very early abortion ##s , up to 7 weeks ge ##station , medical abortion using a mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne – mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l combination regime ##n is considered to be more effective than surgical abortion ( vacuum as ##piration ) , especially when clinical practice does not include detailed inspection of as ##pi ##rated tissue . [SEP]
[CLS] early medical abortion regime ##ns using mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne , followed 24 – 48 hours later by bu ##cca ##l or va ##ginal mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l are 98 % effective up to 9 weeks ge ##station ##al age ; from 9 to 10 weeks efficacy decreases modest ##ly to 94 % . [SEP]
[CLS] if medical abortion fails , surgical abortion must be used to complete the procedure . [SEP]
[CLS] early medical abortion ##s account for the majority of abortion ##s before 9 weeks ge ##station in britain , france , switzerland , and the nordic countries . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , the percentage of early medical abortion ##s performed in non - hospital facilities is 31 % as of 2014 . [SEP]
[CLS] medical abortion regime ##ns using mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne in combination with a pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in analog are the most common methods used for second - trim ##ester abortion ##s in canada , most of europe , china and india , in contrast to the united states where 96 % of second - trim ##ester abortion ##s are performed surgical ##ly by dil ##ation and evacuation . [SEP]
[CLS] up to 15 weeks ' ge ##station , su ##ction - as ##piration or vacuum as ##piration are the most common surgical methods of induced abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] " manual vacuum as ##piration " ( mv ##a ) consists of removing the fe ##tus or embryo , place ##nta , and membranes by su ##ction using a manual sy ##ring ##e , while " electric vacuum as ##piration " ( eva ) uses an electric pump . [SEP]
[CLS] these techniques can both be used very early in pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] mv ##a can be used up to 14 weeks but is more often used earlier in the u . s . eva can be used later . [SEP]
[CLS] mv ##a , also known as " mini - su ##ction " and " men ##st ##ru ##al extraction " or eva can be used in very early pregnancy when cervical dil ##ation may not be required . [SEP]
[CLS] dil ##ation and cure ##tta ##ge ( d & c ) refers to opening the ce ##r ##vi ##x ( dil ##ation ) and removing tissue ( cure ##tta ##ge ) via su ##ction or sharp instruments . [SEP]
[CLS] d & c is a standard g ##yne ##col ##ogical procedure performed for a variety of reasons , including examination of the ut ##erine lining for possible mali ##gnan ##cy , investigation of abnormal bleeding , and abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] the world health organization recommends " sharp cure ##tta ##ge " only when su ##ction as ##piration is unavailable . [SEP]
[CLS] dil ##ation and evacuation ( d & e ) , used after 12 to 16 weeks , consists of opening the ce ##r ##vi ##x and empty ##ing the ut ##erus using surgical instruments and su ##ction . [SEP]
[CLS] d & e is performed va ##ginal ##ly and does not require an inc ##ision . [SEP]
[CLS] intact dil ##ation and extraction ( d & x ) refers to a variant of d & e sometimes used after 18 to 20 weeks when removal of an intact fe ##tus improves surgical safety or for other reasons . [SEP]
[CLS] abortion may also be performed surgical ##ly by h ##yst ##ero ##tom ##y or gr ##avi ##d h ##yst ##ere ##ct ##omy . [SEP]
[CLS] h ##yst ##ero ##tom ##y abortion is a procedure similar to a caesar ##ean section and is performed under general an ##esthesia . [SEP]
[CLS] it requires a smaller inc ##ision than a caesar ##ean section and can be used during later stages of pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] gr ##avi ##d h ##yst ##ere ##ct ##omy refers to removal of the whole ut ##erus while still containing the pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] h ##yst ##ero ##tom ##y and h ##yst ##ere ##ct ##omy are associated with much higher rates of maternal mor ##bid ##ity and mortality than d & e or induction abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] first - trim ##ester procedures can generally be performed using local an ##esthesia , while second - trim ##ester methods may require deep se ##dation or general an ##esthesia . [SEP]
[CLS] in places lacking the necessary medical skill for dil ##ation and extraction , or where preferred by practitioners , an abortion can be induced by first inducing labor and then inducing fetal demise if necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] this is sometimes called " induced mis ##carriage " . [SEP]
[CLS] this procedure may be performed from 13 weeks ge ##station to the third trim ##ester . [SEP]
[CLS] although it is very uncommon in the united states , more than 80 % of induced abortion ##s throughout the second trim ##ester are labor - induced abortion ##s in sweden and other nearby countries . [SEP]
[CLS] only limited data are available comparing this method with dil ##ation and extraction . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike d & e , labor - induced abortion ##s after 18 weeks may be complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival , which may be legally characterized as live birth . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , labor - induced abortion is legally risky in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , a number of herbs reputed to possess ab ##ort ##if ##ac ##ient properties have been used in folk medicine . [SEP]
[CLS] among these are : tan ##sy , penny ##roy ##al , black co ##hosh , and the now - extinct si ##lp ##hi ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1978 one woman in colorado died and another was seriously injured when they attempted to pro ##cure an abortion by taking penny ##roy ##al oil . [SEP]
[CLS] because the ind ##is ##cr ##imi ##nant use of herbs as ab ##ort ##if ##ac ##ient ##s can cause serious — even lethal — side effects , such as multiple organ failure , such use is not recommended by physicians . [SEP]
[CLS] abortion is sometimes attempted by causing trauma to the abdomen . [SEP]
[CLS] the degree of force , if severe , can cause serious internal injuries without necessarily succeeding in inducing mis ##carriage . [SEP]
[CLS] in southeast asia , there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the bas reliefs decor ##ating the temple of ang ##kor wat in cambodia depicts a demon performing such an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the underworld . [SEP]
[CLS] reported methods of unsafe , self - induced abortion include mis ##use of mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l and insertion of non - surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hang ##ers into the ut ##erus . [SEP]
[CLS] these and other methods to terminate pregnancy may be called " induced mis ##carriage " . [SEP]
[CLS] such methods are rarely used in countries where surgical abortion is legal and available . [SEP]
[CLS] the health risks of abortion depend principally upon whether the procedure is performed safely or unsafe ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] the world health organization defines unsafe abortion ##s as those performed by un ##ski ##lled individuals , with hazardous equipment , or in un ##san ##ita ##ry facilities . [SEP]
[CLS] legal abortion ##s performed in the developed world are among the safe ##st procedures in medicine . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , abortion is estimated to be about 14 times safer for women than childbirth . [SEP]
[CLS] cdc estimated in 2019 that us pregnancy - related mortality was 17 . 2 maternal deaths per 100 , 000 live births , while the us abortion mortality rate is 0 . 7 maternal deaths per 100 , 000 procedures . [SEP]
[CLS] in the us from 2000 to 2009 , abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery , and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon . [SEP]
[CLS] five years after seeking abortion services , women who gave birth after being denied an abortion reported worse health than women who had either first or second trim ##ester abortion ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the risk of abortion - related mortality increases with ge ##station ##al age , but remains lower than that of childbirth . [SEP]
[CLS] out ##patient abortion is as safe from 64 to 70 days ' ge ##station as it before 63 days . [SEP]
[CLS] vacuum as ##piration in the first trim ##ester is the safe ##st method of surgical abortion , and can be performed in a primary care office , abortion clinic , or hospital . [SEP]
[CLS] complications , which are rare , can include ut ##erine per ##for ##ation , pe ##l ##vic infection , and retained products of conception requiring a second procedure to evacuate . [SEP]
[CLS] infections account for one - third of abortion - related deaths in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] the rate of complications of vacuum as ##piration abortion in the first trim ##ester is similar regardless of whether the procedure is performed in a hospital , surgical center , or office . [SEP]
[CLS] prevent ##ive antibiotics ( such as do ##xy ##cy ##cl ##ine or metro ##ni ##da ##zo ##le ) are typically given before abortion procedures , as they are believed to substantially reduce the risk of post ##oper ##ative ut ##erine infection ; however , antibiotics are not routinely given with abortion pills . [SEP]
[CLS] the rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the abortion is performed by a doctor or a mid - level practitioner . [SEP]
[CLS] complications after second - trim ##ester abortion are similar to those after first - trim ##ester abortion , and depend somewhat on the method chosen . [SEP]
[CLS] second - trim ##ester abortion ##s are generally well - tolerated . [SEP]
[CLS] there is little difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical abortion using a combined regime ##n of mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne and mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l and surgical abortion ( vacuum as ##piration ) in early first trim ##ester abortion ##s up to 10 weeks ge ##station . [SEP]
[CLS] medical abortion using the pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in analog mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l alone is less effective and more painful than medical abortion using a combined regime ##n of mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne and mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l or surgical abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] some purported risks of abortion are promoted primarily by anti - abortion groups , but lack scientific support . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the question of a link between induced abortion and breast cancer has been investigated extensively . [SEP]
[CLS] major medical and scientific bodies ( including the world health organization , national cancer institute , american cancer society , royal college of ob ##gy ##n and american congress of ob ##gy ##n ) have concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer . [SEP]
[CLS] in the past even illegal ##ity has not automatically meant that the abortion ##s were unsafe . [SEP]
[CLS] referring to the u . s . , historian linda gordon states : " in fact , illegal abortion ##s in this country have an impressive safety record . " [SEP]
[CLS] according to rick ##ie sol ##inger , authors jerome bates and edward za ##wad ##z ##ki describe the case of an illegal abortion ##ist in the eastern u . s . in the early 20th century who was proud of having successfully completed 13 , 84 ##4 abortion ##s without any fatal ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1870s new york city the famous abortion ##ist / mid ##wife madame rest ##ell ( anna tr ##ow lo ##hman ) appears to have lost very few women among her more than 100 , 000 patients — a lower mortality rate than the childbirth mortality rate at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1936 the prominent professor of ob ##ste ##trics and g ##yne ##cology frederick j . tau ##ssi ##g wrote that a cause of increasing mortality during the years of illegal ##ity in the u . s . was that [SEP]
[CLS] current evidence finds no relationship between most induced abortion ##s and mental - health problems other than those expected for any unwanted pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] a report by the american psychological association concluded that a woman ' s first abortion is not a threat to mental health when carried out in the first trim ##ester , with such women no more likely to have mental - health problems than those carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term ; the mental - health outcome of a woman ' s second or greater abortion is less certain . [SEP]
[CLS] some older reviews concluded that abortion was associated with an increased risk of psychological problems ; however , they did not use an appropriate control group . [SEP]
[CLS] although some studies show negative mental - health outcomes in women who choose abortion ##s after the first trim ##ester because of fetal abnormalities , more rigorous research would be needed to show this con ##clusive ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] some proposed negative psychological effects of abortion have been referred to by anti - abortion advocates as a separate condition called " post - abortion syndrome " , but this is not recognized by medical or psychological professionals in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] women seeking an abortion may use unsafe methods , especially when abortion is legally restricted . [SEP]
[CLS] they may attempt self - induced abortion or seek the help of a person without proper medical training or facilities . [SEP]
[CLS] this can lead to severe complications , such as incomplete abortion , sep ##sis , hem ##or ##rh ##age , and damage to internal organs . [SEP]
[CLS] unsafe abortion ##s are a major cause of injury and death among women worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] although data are imp ##re ##cise , it is estimated that approximately 20 million unsafe abortion ##s are performed annually , with 97 % taking place in developing countries . [SEP]
[CLS] unsafe abortion ##s are believed to result in millions of injuries . [SEP]
[CLS] estimates of deaths vary according to methodology , and have ranged from 37 , 000 to 70 , 000 in the past decade ; deaths from unsafe abortion account for around 13 % of all maternal deaths . [SEP]
[CLS] the world health organization believes that mortality has fallen since the 1990s . [SEP]
[CLS] to reduce the number of unsafe abortion ##s , public health organizations have generally advocated emphasizing the legal ##ization of abortion , training of medical personnel , and ensuring access to reproductive - health services . [SEP]
[CLS] in response , opponents of abortion point out that abortion ban ##s in no way affect pre ##nat ##al care for women who choose to carry their fe ##tus to term . [SEP]
[CLS] the dublin declaration on maternal health , signed in 2012 , notes , " the prohibition of abortion does not affect , in any way , the availability of optimal care to pregnant women . " [SEP]
[CLS] a major factor in whether abortion ##s are performed safely or not is the legal standing of abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] countries with restrictive abortion laws have higher rates of unsafe abortion and similar overall abortion rates compared to those where abortion is legal and available . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the 1996 legal ##ization of abortion in south africa had an immediate positive impact on the frequency of abortion - related complications , with abortion - related deaths dropping by more than 90 % . [SEP]
[CLS] similar reductions in maternal mortality have been observed after other countries have liberal ##ized their abortion laws , such as romania and nepal . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2011 study concluded that in the united states , some state - level anti - abortion laws are correlated with lower rates of abortion in that state . [SEP]
[CLS] the analysis , however , did not take into account travel to other states without such laws to obtain an abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , a lack of access to effective contra ##ception contributes to unsafe abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been estimated that the incidence of unsafe abortion could be reduced by up to 75 % ( from 20 million to 5 million annually ) if modern family planning and maternal health services were readily available globally . [SEP]
[CLS] rates of such abortion ##s may be difficult to measure because they can be reported variously as mis ##carriage , " induced mis ##carriage " , " men ##st ##ru ##al regulation " , " mini - abortion " , and " regulation of a delayed / suspended men ##st ##ru ##ation " . [SEP]
[CLS] forty percent of the world ' s women are able to access therapeutic and elect ##ive abortion ##s within ge ##station ##al limits , while an additional 35 percent have access to legal abortion if they meet certain physical , mental , or socio ##economic criteria . [SEP]
[CLS] while maternal mortality seldom results from safe abortion ##s , unsafe abortion ##s result in 70 , 000 deaths and 5 million disabilities per year . [SEP]
[CLS] complications of unsafe abortion account for approximately an eighth of maternal mortal ##ities worldwide , though this varies by region . [SEP]
[CLS] secondary in ##fer ##tility caused by an unsafe abortion affects an estimated 24 million women . [SEP]
[CLS] the rate of unsafe abortion ##s has increased from 44 % to 49 % between 1995 and 2008 . [SEP]
[CLS] health education , access to family planning , and improvements in health care during and after abortion have been proposed to address this phenomenon . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2019 , a us senate bill entitled the " born - alive abortion survivors protection act " raised the issue of live birth after abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] the bill would mandate that medical providers res ##us ##cit ##ate neon ##ates delivered showing signs of life during an abortion process . [SEP]
[CLS] during the debate around this issue , us republicans falsely alleged that medical providers " execute " live - born babies . [SEP]
[CLS] existing us laws would punish execution as homicide . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , us abortion experts ref ##ute the claim that a " born - alive " fe ##tus is a common event and reject laws that would mandate res ##us ##cit ##ation against the wishes of the parents . [SEP]
[CLS] only 1 . 3 % of abortion ##s occur after 21 weeks of pregnancy in the us . [SEP]
[CLS] although it is very uncommon , women undergoing surgical abortion after this ge ##station ##al age sometimes give birth to a fe ##tus that may survive briefly . [SEP]
[CLS] the per ##iv ##iable period is considered to be between 20 to 25 weeks ge ##station . [SEP]
[CLS] long - term survival is possible after 22 weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] however , odds of long - term survival between 22 and 23 weeks are 2 - 3 percent and odds of survival between 23 and 24 weeks are 20 percent . [SEP]
[CLS] " intact survival " , which means survival of a neon ##ate without subsequent damage to organs such as the brain or bow ##el is 1 % at 22 weeks and 13 % at 23 weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] survival odds increase with increasing ge ##station ##al age . [SEP]
[CLS] if medical staff observe signs of life , they may be required to provide care : emergency medical care if the child has a good chance of survival and pal ##lia ##tive care if not . [SEP]
[CLS] induced fetal demise before termination of pregnancy after 20 – 21 weeks ge ##station is recommended by some sources to avoid this and to comply with the us partial birth abortion ban . [SEP]
[CLS] induced fetal demise does not improve the safety of an abortion procedure and may inc ##ur risks to the health of the woman having the abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] in many places , where abortion is illegal or carries a heavy social stigma , medical reporting of abortion is not reliable . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , estimates of the incidence of abortion must be made without determining certainty related to standard error . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of abortion ##s performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in recent years , with 41 . 6 million having been performed in 2003 and 43 . 8 million having been performed in 2008 . [SEP]
[CLS] the abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women , though it was 24 per 1000 women for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women for developing countries . [SEP]
[CLS] the same 2012 study indicated that in 2008 , the estimated abortion percentage of known pre ##gnan ##cies was at 21 % worldwide , with 26 % in developed countries and 20 % in developing countries . [SEP]
[CLS] on average , the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] however , restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortion ##s performed unsafe ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] the unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly at ##tri ##bu ##table to lack of access to modern contra ##ceptive ##s ; according to the gut ##tma ##cher institute , providing access to contra ##ceptive ##s would result in about 14 . 5 million fewer unsafe abortion ##s and 38 , 000 fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] the rate of legal , induced abortion varies extensively worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the report of employees of gut ##tma ##cher institute it ranged from 7 per 1000 women ( germany and switzerland ) to 30 per 1000 women ( estonia ) in countries with complete statistics in 2008 . [SEP]
[CLS] the proportion of pre ##gnan ##cies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about 10 % ( israel , the netherlands and switzerland ) to 30 % ( estonia ) in the same group , though it might be as high as 36 % in hungary and romania , whose statistics were deemed incomplete . [SEP]
[CLS] an american study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortion ##s were using a form of contra ##ception at the time of becoming pregnant . [SEP]
[CLS] inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and three - quarters of those using the birth control pill ; 42 % of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or break ##age . [SEP]
[CLS] the gut ##tma ##cher institute estimated that " most abortion ##s in the united states are obtained by minority women " because minority women " have much higher rates of un ##int ##ended pregnancy " . [SEP]
[CLS] the abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortion ##s a woman has during her reproductive years ; this is referred to as " total abortion rate " ( tar ) . [SEP]
[CLS] abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2003 , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) reported that 26 % of reported legal induced abortion ##s in the united states were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks ' ge ##station , 18 % at 7 weeks , 15 % at 8 weeks , 18 % at 9 through 10 weeks , 10 % at 11 through 12 weeks , 6 % at 13 through 15 weeks , 4 % at 16 through 20 weeks and 1 % at more than 21 weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] 91 % of these were classified as having been done by " cure ##tta ##ge " ( su ##ction - as ##piration , dil ##ation and cure ##tta ##ge , dil ##ation and evacuation ) , 8 % by " medical " means ( mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne ) , > 1 % by " intra ##uter ##ine ins ##till ##ation " ( saline or pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in ) , and 1 % by " other " ( including h ##yst ##ero ##tom ##y and h ##yst ##ere ##ct ##omy ) . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the cdc , due to data collection difficulties the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond 20 weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortion ##s if the removal of the dead fe ##tus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion .

[CLS] the gut ##tma ##cher institute estimated there were 2 , 200 intact dil ##ation and extraction procedures in the us during 2000 ; this accounts for < 0 . 2 % of the total number of abortion ##s performed that year . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , in england and wales in 2006 , 89 % of termination ##s occurred at or under 12 weeks , 9 % between 13 and 19 weeks , and 2 % at or over 20 weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] 64 % of those reported were by vacuum as ##piration , 6 % by d & e , and 30 % were medical . [SEP]
[CLS] there are more second trim ##ester abortion ##s in developing countries such as china , india and vietnam than in developed countries . [SEP]
[CLS] the reasons why women have abortion ##s are diverse and vary across the world . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the reasons may include an inability to afford a child , domestic violence , lack of support , feeling they are too young , and the wish to complete education or advance a career . [SEP]
[CLS] additional reasons include not being willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or inc ##est . [SEP]
[CLS] some abortion ##s are undergone as the result of societal pressures . [SEP]
[CLS] these might include the preference for children of a specific sex or race , disapproval of single or early mother ##hood , stigma ##ti ##zation of people with disabilities , insufficient economic support for families , lack of access to or rejection of contra ##ceptive methods , or efforts toward population control ( such as china ' s one - child policy ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or sex - selective abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] an additional factor is risk to maternal or fetal health , which was cited as the primary reason for abortion in over a third of cases in some countries and as a significant factor in only a single - digit percentage of abortion ##s in other countries . [SEP]
[CLS] in the u . s . , the supreme court decisions in " roe v . wade " and " doe v . bolton " : " ruled that the state ' s interest in the life of the fe ##tus became compelling only at the point of via ##bility , defined as the point at which the fe ##tus can survive independently of its mother . [SEP]
[CLS] even after the point of via ##bility , the state cannot favor the life of the fe ##tus over the life or health of the pregnant woman . [SEP]
[CLS] under the right of privacy , physicians must be free to use their " medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother . " [SEP]
[CLS] on the same day that the court decided roe , it also decided doe v . bolton , in which the court defined health very broadly : " the medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors — physical , emotional , psychological , fa ##mi ##lia ##l , and the woman ' s age — relevant to the well - being of the patient . [SEP]
[CLS] all these factors may relate to health . [SEP]
[CLS] this allows the attending physician the room he needs to make his best medical judgment . " [SEP]
[CLS] public opinion shifted in america following television personality she ##rri fin ##k ##bine ' s discovery during her fifth month of pregnancy that she had been exposed to tha ##lid ##omi ##de . [SEP]
[CLS] unable to obtain a legal abortion in the united states , she traveled to sweden . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1962 to 1965 , an outbreak of german me ##as ##les left 15 , 000 babies with severe birth defects . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1967 , the american medical association publicly supported liberal ##ization of abortion laws . [SEP]
[CLS] a national opinion research center poll in 1965 showed 73 % supported abortion when the mother ' s life was at risk , 57 % when birth defects were present and 59 % for pre ##gnan ##cies resulting from rape or inc ##est . [SEP]
[CLS] the rate of cancer during pregnancy is 0 . 02 – 1 % , and in many cases , cancer of the mother leads to consideration of abortion to protect the life of the mother , or in response to the potential damage that may occur to the fe ##tus during treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] this is particularly true for cervical cancer , the most common type of which occurs in 1 of every 2 , 000 – 13 , 000 pre ##gnan ##cies , for which initiation of treatment " cannot co - exist with preservation of fetal life ( unless neo ##ad ##ju ##vant chemotherapy is chosen ) " . [SEP]
[CLS] very early stage cervical cancers ( i and ii ##a ) may be treated by radical h ##yst ##ere ##ct ##omy and pe ##l ##vic l ##ym ##ph node di ##sse ##ction , radiation therapy , or both , while later stages are treated by radio ##therapy . [SEP]
[CLS] chemotherapy may be used simultaneously . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations , because lump ##ect ##omy is discouraged in favor of modified radical mast ##ect ##omy unless late - term pregnancy allows follow - up radiation therapy to be administered after the birth . [SEP]
[CLS] exposure to a single chemotherapy drug is estimated to cause a 7 . 5 – 17 % risk of ter ##ato ##genic effects on the fe ##tus , with higher risks for multiple drug treatments . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment with more than 40 g ##y of radiation usually causes spontaneous abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] exposure to much lower doses during the first trim ##ester , especially 8 to 15 weeks of development , can cause intellectual disability or micro ##ce ##pha ##ly , and exposure at this or subsequent stages can cause reduced intra ##uter ##ine growth and birth weight . [SEP]
[CLS] exposure ##s above 0 . 00 ##5 – 0 . 02 ##5 g ##y cause a dose - dependent reduction in iq . [SEP]
[CLS] it is possible to greatly reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding , depending on how far the area to be ir ##rad ##iated is from the fe ##tus . [SEP]
[CLS] the process of birth itself may also put the mother at risk . [SEP]
[CLS] " va ##ginal delivery may result in dissemination of neo ##pl ##astic cells into l ##ym ##ph ##ova ##scu ##lar channels , ha ##em ##or ##rh ##age , cervical lace ##ration and implant ##ation of mali ##gnant cells in the ep ##isi ##oto ##my site , while abdominal delivery may delay the initiation of non - surgical treatment . " [SEP]
[CLS] since ancient times abortion ##s have been done using herbal medicines , sharp tools , with force , or through other traditional methods . [SEP]
[CLS] induced abortion has long history and can be traced back to civilizations as varied as china under shen ##non ##g ( c . 270 ##0 bce ) , ancient egypt with its e ##bers papyrus ( c . 1550 bce ) , and the roman empire in the time of ju ##ven ##al ( c . 200 ce ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there is evidence to suggest that pre ##gnan ##cies were terminated through a number of methods , including the administration of ab ##ort ##if ##ac ##ient herbs , the use of sharpened implements , the application of abdominal pressure , and other techniques . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the earliest known artistic representations of abortion is in a bas relief at ang ##kor wat ( c . 115 ##0 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] found in a series of fr ##ie ##zes that represent judgment after death in hindu and buddhist culture , it depicts the technique of abdominal abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] some medical scholars and abortion opponents have suggested that the hip ##po ##cratic oath forbade ancient greek physicians from performing abortion ##s ; other scholars disagree with this interpretation , and state that the medical texts of hip ##po ##cratic corpus contain descriptions of ab ##ort ##ive techniques right alongside the oath . [SEP]
[CLS] the physician sc ##ri ##bon ##ius la ##rg ##us wrote in 43 ce that the hip ##po ##cratic oath prohibits abortion , as did so ##ran ##us , although apparently not all doctors adhere ##d to it strictly at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] according to so ##ran ##us ' 1st or 2nd century ce work " g ##yna ##ec ##ology " , one party of medical practitioners banished all ab ##ort ##ives as required by the hip ##po ##cratic oath ; the other party — to which he belonged — was willing to pre ##scribe abortion ##s , but only for the sake of the mother ' s health . [SEP]
[CLS] aristotle , in his treatise on government " politics " ( 350 bce ) , condemn ##s infant ##icide as a means of population control . [SEP]
[CLS] he preferred abortion in such cases , with the restriction " that it must be practised on it before it has developed sensation and life ; for the line between lawful and unlawful abortion will be marked by the fact of having sensation and being alive " . [SEP]
[CLS] in christianity , pope six ##tus v ( 158 ##5 – 90 ) was the only pope before 1869 to declare that abortion is homicide regardless of the stage of pregnancy ; and his pro ##no ##unce ##ment of 158 ##8 was reversed three years later by his successor . [SEP]
[CLS] through most of its history the catholic church was divided on whether it believed that abortion was murder , and it did not begin vigorously opposing abortion until the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , several historians have written that prior to the 19th century most catholic authors did not regard termination of pregnancy before " quick ##ening " or " en ##so ##ul ##ment " as an abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] a 1995 survey reported that catholic women are as likely as the general population to terminate a pregnancy , protestants are less likely to do so , and evangelical christians are the least likely to do so . [SEP]
[CLS] islamic tradition has traditionally permitted abortion until a point in time when muslims believe the soul enters the fe ##tus , considered by various theologians to be at conception , 40 days after conception , 120 days after conception , or quick ##ening . [SEP]
[CLS] however , abortion is largely heavily restricted or forbidden in areas of high islamic faith such as the middle east and north africa . [SEP]
[CLS] in europe and north america , abortion techniques advanced starting in the 17th century . [SEP]
[CLS] however , con ##ser ##vati ##sm by most physicians with regards to sexual matters prevented the wide expansion of safe abortion techniques . [SEP]
[CLS] other medical practitioners in addition to some physicians advertised their services , and they were not widely regulated until the 19th century , when the practice ( sometimes called " rest ##elli ##sm " ) was banned in both the united states and the united kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] church groups as well as physicians were highly influential in anti - abortion movements . [SEP]
[CLS] in the us , according to some sources , abortion was more dangerous than childbirth until about 1930 when inc ##rem ##ental improvements in abortion procedures relative to childbirth made abortion safer . [SEP]
[CLS] however , other sources maintain that in the 19th century early abortion ##s under the h ##y ##gie ##nic conditions in which mid ##wives usually worked were relatively safe . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , some commentators have written that , despite improved medical procedures , the period from the 1930s until legal ##ization also saw more ze ##alo ##us enforcement of anti - abortion laws , and con ##com ##itan ##tly an increasing control of abortion providers by organized crime . [SEP]
[CLS] soviet russia ( 1919 ) , iceland ( 1935 ) and sweden ( 1938 ) were among the first countries to legal ##ize certain or all forms of abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1935 nazi germany , a law was passed permitting abortion ##s for those deemed " here ##dit ##ari ##ly ill " , while women considered of german stock were specifically prohibited from having abortion ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning in the second half of the twentieth century , abortion was legal ##ized in a greater number of countries . [SEP]
[CLS] induced abortion has long been the source of considerable debate . [SEP]
[CLS] ethical , moral , philosophical , biological , religious and legal issues surrounding abortion are related to value systems . [SEP]
[CLS] opinions of abortion may be about fetal rights , governmental authority , and women ' s rights . [SEP]
[CLS] in both public and private debate , arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral per ##mis ##sibility of an induced abortion , or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] the world medical association declaration on therapeutic abortion notes , " circumstances bringing the interests of a mother into conflict with the interests of her un ##born child create a dilemma and raise the question as to whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated . " [SEP]
[CLS] abortion debates , especially pertaining to abortion laws , are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions . [SEP]
[CLS] anti - abortion groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion , including complete prohibition , most often describe themselves as " pro - life " while abortion rights groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as " pro - choice " . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , the former position argues that a human fe ##tus is a human person with a right to live , making abortion morally the same as murder . [SEP]
[CLS] the latter position argues that a woman has certain reproductive rights , especially the right to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term . [SEP]
[CLS] current laws pertaining to abortion are diverse . [SEP]
[CLS] religious , moral , and cultural factors continue to influence abortion laws throughout the world . [SEP]
[CLS] the right to life , the right to liberty , the right to security of person , and the right to reproductive health are major issues of human rights that sometimes constitute the basis for the existence or absence of abortion laws . [SEP]
[CLS] in jurisdictions where abortion is legal , certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a safe , legal abortion ( an abortion performed without the woman ' s consent is considered fe ##tic ##ide ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these requirements usually depend on the age of the fe ##tus , often using a trim ##ester - based system to regulate the window of legal ##ity , or as in the u . s . , on a doctor ' s evaluation of the fe ##tus ' via ##bility . [SEP]
[CLS] some jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure , pre ##scribe the distribution of information on fetal development , or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the consent of the fe ##tus ' father before ab ##ort ##ing the fe ##tus , that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure — sometimes including " risks " not supported by the medical literature — and that multiple medical authorities ce ##rti ##fy that the abortion is either medical ##ly or socially necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] many restrictions are waived in emergency situations . [SEP]
[CLS] china , which has ended their one - child policy , and now has a two child policy , has at times incorporated mandatory abortion ##s as part of their population control strategy . [SEP]
[CLS] other jurisdictions ban abortion almost entirely . [SEP]
[CLS] many , but not all , of these allow legal abortion ##s in a variety of circumstances . [SEP]
[CLS] these circumstances vary based on jurisdiction , but may include whether the pregnancy is a result of rape or inc ##est , the fe ##tus ' development is impaired , the woman ' s physical or mental well - being is endangered , or socio ##economic considerations make childbirth a hardship . [SEP]
[CLS] in countries where abortion is banned entirely , such as nicaragua , medical authorities have recorded rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy as well as deaths due to doctors ' fears of prosecution if they treat other g ##yne ##col ##ogical emergencies . [SEP]
[CLS] some countries , such as bangladesh , that nominally ban abortion , may also support clinics that perform abortion ##s under the guise of men ##st ##ru ##al hygiene . [SEP]
[CLS] this is also a terminology in traditional medicine . [SEP]
[CLS] in places where abortion is illegal or carries heavy social stigma , pregnant women may engage in medical tourism and travel to countries where they can terminate their pre ##gnan ##cies . [SEP]
[CLS] women without the means to travel can resort to providers of illegal abortion ##s or attempt to perform an abortion by themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] the organization women on waves , has been providing education about medical abortion ##s since 1999 . [SEP]
[CLS] the ngo created a mobile medical clinic inside a shipping container , which then travels on rented ships to countries with restrictive abortion laws . [SEP]
[CLS] because the ships are registered in the netherlands , dutch law pre ##va ##ils when the ship is in international waters . [SEP]
[CLS] while in port , the organization provides free workshops and education ; while in international waters , medical personnel are legally able to pre ##scribe medical abortion drugs and counseling . [SEP]
[CLS] son ##ography and am ##nio ##cent ##esis allow parents to determine sex before childbirth . [SEP]
[CLS] the development of this technology has led to sex - selective abortion , or the termination of a fe ##tus based on sex . [SEP]
[CLS] the selective termination of a female fe ##tus is most common . [SEP]
[CLS] sex - selective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable di ##spar ##ities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries . [SEP]
[CLS] the preference for male children is reported in many areas of asia , and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in taiwan , south korea , india , and china . [SEP]
[CLS] this deviation from the standard birth rates of males and females occurs despite the fact that the country in question may have officially banned sex - selective abortion or even sex - screening . [SEP]
[CLS] in china , a historical preference for a male child has been ex ##ace ##rba ##ted by the one - child policy , which was enacted in 1979 . [SEP]
[CLS] many countries have taken legislative steps to reduce the incidence of sex - selective abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] at the international conference on population and development in 1994 over 180 states agreed to eliminate " all forms of discrimination against the girl child and the root causes of son preference " , conditions also condemned by a pace resolution in 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] the world health organization and unicef , along with other united nations agencies , have found that measures to reduce access to abortion are much less effective at reducing sex - selective abortion ##s than measures to reduce gender inequality . [SEP]
[CLS] in a number of cases , abortion providers and these facilities have been subjected to various forms of violence , including murder , attempted murder , kidnapping , stalking , assault , arson , and bombing . [SEP]
[CLS] anti - abortion violence is classified by both governmental and scholarly sources as terrorism . [SEP]
[CLS] in the u . s . and canada , over 8 , 000 incidents of violence , tres ##pass ##ing , and death threats have been recorded by providers since 1977 , including over 200 bombings / arson ##s and hundreds of assaults . [SEP]
[CLS] the majority of abortion opponents have not been involved in violent acts . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , four physicians who performed abortion ##s have been murdered : david gunn ( 1993 ) , john brit ##ton ( 1994 ) , barnett sl ##ep ##ian ( 1998 ) , and george till ##er ( 2009 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] also murdered , in the u . s . and australia , have been other personnel at abortion clinics , including receptionist ##s and security guards such as james barrett , shannon low ##ney , lee ann nichols , and robert sanders ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] wounding ##s ( e . g . , ga ##rson roma ##lis ) and attempted murders have also taken place in the united states and canada . [SEP]
[CLS] hundreds of bombings , arson ##s , acid attacks , invasions , and incidents of van ##dal ##ism against abortion providers have occurred . [SEP]
[CLS] notable perpetrators of anti - abortion violence include eric robert rudolph , scott roe ##der , shelley shannon , and paul jennings hill , the first person to be executed in the united states for murdering an abortion provider . [SEP]
[CLS] legal protection of access to abortion has been brought into some countries where abortion is legal . [SEP]
[CLS] these laws typically seek to protect abortion clinics from obstruction , van ##dal ##ism , picket ##ing , and other actions , or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment . [SEP]
[CLS] far more common than physical violence is psychological pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2003 , chris dan ##ze organized pro - life organizations throughout texas to prevent the construction of a planned parent ##hood facility in austin . [SEP]
[CLS] the organizations released the personal information online , of those involved with construction , sending them up to 1200 phone calls a day and contact ##ing their churches . [SEP]
[CLS] some protest ##ors record women entering clinics on camera . [SEP]
[CLS] spontaneous abortion occurs in various animals . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in sheep it may be caused by stress or physical ex ##ert ##ion , such as crowd ##ing through doors or being chased by dogs . [SEP]
[CLS] in cows , abortion may be caused by con ##tag ##ious disease , such as bruce ##llo ##sis or " camp ##yl ##ob ##act ##er " , but can often be controlled by va ##cci ##nation . [SEP]
[CLS] eating pine needles can also induce abortion ##s in cows . [SEP]
[CLS] several plants , including broom ##weed , sk ##unk cabbage , poison hem ##lock , and tree tobacco , are known to cause fetal def ##or ##mit ##ies and abortion in cattle and in sheep and goats . [SEP]
[CLS] in horses , a fe ##tus may be ab ##orted or res ##or ##bed if it has lethal white syndrome ( congenital int ##estinal ag ##ang ##lion ##osis ) . [SEP]
[CLS] f ##oa ##l embryo ##s that are homo ##zy ##go ##us for the dominant white gene ( w ##w ) are theo ##rized to also be ab ##orted or res ##or ##bed before birth . [SEP]
[CLS] in many species of sharks and rays , stress - induced abortion ##s occur frequently on capture . [SEP]
[CLS] viral infection can cause abortion in dogs . [SEP]
[CLS] cats can experience spontaneous abortion for many reasons , including ho ##rm ##onal im ##balance . [SEP]
[CLS] a combined abortion and spa ##ying is performed on pregnant cats , especially in trap - ne ##uter - return programs , to prevent unwanted kitten ##s from being born . [SEP]
[CLS] female rodents may terminate a pregnancy when exposed to the smell of a male not responsible for the pregnancy , known as the bruce effect . [SEP]
[CLS] abortion may also be induced in animals , in the context of animal husband ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , abortion may be induced in mare ##s that have been mated improper ##ly , or that have been purchased by owners who did not realize the mare ##s were pregnant , or that are pregnant with twin f ##oa ##ls . [SEP]
[CLS] fe ##tic ##ide can occur in horses and zebra ##s due to male harassment of pregnant mare ##s or forced cop ##ulation , although the frequency in the wild has been questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] male gray lang ##ur monkeys may attack females following male takeover , causing mis ##carriage . [SEP]
