[CLS] abortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fe ##tus before it can survive outside the ut ##erus . [SEP]
[CLS] when deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy , it is called an induced abortion , or less frequently " induced mis ##carriage " . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar procedure after the fe ##tus has potential to survive outside the womb is known as a " late termination of pregnancy " or less accurately as a " late term abortion " . [SEP]
[CLS] when properly done , abortion is one of the safe ##st procedures in medicine , but unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal death , especially in the developing world . [SEP]
[CLS] the drug mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne in combination with pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in appears to be as safe and effective as surgery during the first and second trim ##ester of pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] birth control , such as the pill or intra ##uter ##ine devices , can be used immediately following abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] when performed legally and safely on a woman who desires it , induced abortion ##s do not increase the risk of long - term mental or physical problems . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , unsafe abortion ##s ( those performed by un ##ski ##lled individuals , with hazardous equipment , or in un ##san ##ita ##ry facilities ) cause 47 , 000 deaths and 5 million hospital admissions each year . [SEP]
[CLS] around 56 million abortion ##s are performed each year in the world , with about 45 % done unsafe ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008 , before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased . [SEP]
[CLS] countries that permit abortion ##s have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed . [SEP]
[CLS] in some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape , problems with the fe ##tus , poverty , risk to a woman ' s health , or inc ##est . [SEP]
[CLS] an induced abortion may be classified as " therapeutic " ( done in response to a health condition of the women or fe ##tus ) or " elect ##ive " ( chosen for other reasons ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united kingdom , 1 to 2 % of abortion ##s are done due to genetic problems in the fe ##tus . [SEP]
[CLS] the manner selected often depends upon the ge ##station ##al age of the embryo or fe ##tus , which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses . [SEP]
[CLS] an abortion is medical ##ly referred to as a therapeutic abortion when it is performed to save the life of the pregnant woman ; to prevent harm to the woman ' s physical or mental health ; to terminate a pregnancy where indications are that the child will have a significantly increased chance of mortality or mor ##bid ##ity ; or to selective ##ly reduce the number of fe ##tus ##es to less ##en health risks associated with multiple pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] an abortion is referred to as an elect ##ive or voluntary abortion when it is performed at the request of the woman for non - medical reasons . [SEP]
[CLS] mis ##carriage , also known as spontaneous abortion , is the un ##int ##ent ##ional expulsion of an embryo or fe ##tus before the 24th week of ge ##station . [SEP]
[CLS] a pregnancy that ends before 37 weeks of ge ##station resulting in a live - born infant is a " premature birth " or a " pre ##ter ##m birth " . [SEP]
[CLS] premature births and still ##bir ##ths are generally not considered to be mis ##carriage ##s although usage of these terms can sometimes overlap . [SEP]
[CLS] the vast majority of those that do not progress are lost before the woman is aware of the conception , and many pre ##gnan ##cies are lost before medical practitioners can detect an embryo . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common cause of spontaneous abortion during the first trim ##ester is ch ##rom ##osomal abnormalities of the embryo or fe ##tus , accounting for at least 50 % of sampled early pregnancy losses . [SEP]
[CLS] advancing maternal age and a woman ' s history of previous spontaneous abortion ##s are the two leading factors associated with a greater risk of spontaneous abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] medical abortion became an alternative method of abortion with the availability of pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in analog ##s in the 1970s and the anti ##pro ##ges ##to ##gen mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne ( also known as ru - 48 ##6 ) in the 1980s . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common early first - trim ##ester medical abortion regime ##ns use mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne in combination with mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l ( or sometimes another pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in analog , gem ##ep ##ros ##t ) up to 10 weeks ( 70 days ) ge ##station ##al age , met ##hot ##re ##xa ##te in combination with a pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in analog up to 7 weeks ge ##station , or a pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in analog alone . [SEP]
[CLS] medical abortion regiments involving mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne followed by mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l in the cheek between 24 and 48 hours later are effective when performed before 70 days ' ge ##station . [SEP]
[CLS] in very early abortion ##s , up to 7 weeks ge ##station , medical abortion using a mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne – mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l combination regime ##n is considered to be more effective than surgical abortion ( vacuum as ##piration ) , especially when clinical practice does not include detailed inspection of as ##pi ##rated tissue . [SEP]
[CLS] early medical abortion ##s account for the majority of abortion ##s before 9 weeks ge ##station in britain , france , switzerland , and the nordic countries . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , the percentage of early medical abortion ##s performed in non - hospital facilities is 31 % as of 2014 . [SEP]
[CLS] medical abortion regime ##ns using mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne in combination with a pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in analog are the most common methods used for second - trim ##ester abortion ##s in canada , most of europe , china and india , in contrast to the united states where 96 % of second - trim ##ester abortion ##s are performed surgical ##ly by dil ##ation and evacuation . [SEP]
[CLS] mv ##a , also known as " mini - su ##ction " and " men ##st ##ru ##al extraction " or eva can be used in very early pregnancy when cervical dil ##ation may not be required . [SEP]
[CLS] intact dil ##ation and extraction ( d & x ) refers to a variant of d & e sometimes used after 18 to 20 weeks when removal of an intact fe ##tus improves surgical safety or for other reasons . [SEP]
[CLS] h ##yst ##ero ##tom ##y abortion is a procedure similar to a caesar ##ean section and is performed under general an ##esthesia . [SEP]
[CLS] it requires a smaller inc ##ision than a caesar ##ean section and can be used during later stages of pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] gr ##avi ##d h ##yst ##ere ##ct ##omy refers to removal of the whole ut ##erus while still containing the pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] h ##yst ##ero ##tom ##y and h ##yst ##ere ##ct ##omy are associated with much higher rates of maternal mor ##bid ##ity and mortality than d & e or induction abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] in places lacking the necessary medical skill for dil ##ation and extraction , or where preferred by practitioners , an abortion can be induced by first inducing labor and then inducing fetal demise if necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] although it is very uncommon in the united states , more than 80 % of induced abortion ##s throughout the second trim ##ester are labor - induced abortion ##s in sweden and other nearby countries . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , labor - induced abortion is legally risky in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , a number of herbs reputed to possess ab ##ort ##if ##ac ##ient properties have been used in folk medicine . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1978 one woman in colorado died and another was seriously injured when they attempted to pro ##cure an abortion by taking penny ##roy ##al oil . [SEP]
[CLS] because the ind ##is ##cr ##imi ##nant use of herbs as ab ##ort ##if ##ac ##ient ##s can cause serious — even lethal — side effects , such as multiple organ failure , such use is not recommended by physicians . [SEP]
[CLS] in southeast asia , there is an ancient tradition of attempting abortion through forceful abdominal massage . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the bas reliefs decor ##ating the temple of ang ##kor wat in cambodia depicts a demon performing such an abortion upon a woman who has been sent to the underworld . [SEP]
[CLS] reported methods of unsafe , self - induced abortion include mis ##use of mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l and insertion of non - surgical implements such as knitting needles and clothes hang ##ers into the ut ##erus . [SEP]
[CLS] such methods are rarely used in countries where surgical abortion is legal and available . [SEP]
[CLS] the world health organization defines unsafe abortion ##s as those performed by un ##ski ##lled individuals , with hazardous equipment , or in un ##san ##ita ##ry facilities . [SEP]
[CLS] the risk of abortion - related mortality increases with ge ##station ##al age , but remains lower than that of childbirth . [SEP]
[CLS] vacuum as ##piration in the first trim ##ester is the safe ##st method of surgical abortion , and can be performed in a primary care office , abortion clinic , or hospital . [SEP]
[CLS] the rate of complications of vacuum as ##piration abortion in the first trim ##ester is similar regardless of whether the procedure is performed in a hospital , surgical center , or office . [SEP]
[CLS] prevent ##ive antibiotics ( such as do ##xy ##cy ##cl ##ine or metro ##ni ##da ##zo ##le ) are typically given before abortion procedures , as they are believed to substantially reduce the risk of post ##oper ##ative ut ##erine infection ; however , antibiotics are not routinely given with abortion pills . [SEP]
[CLS] the rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the abortion is performed by a doctor or a mid - level practitioner . [SEP]
[CLS] complications after second - trim ##ester abortion are similar to those after first - trim ##ester abortion , and depend somewhat on the method chosen . [SEP]
[CLS] there is little difference in terms of safety and efficacy between medical abortion using a combined regime ##n of mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne and mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l and surgical abortion ( vacuum as ##piration ) in early first trim ##ester abortion ##s up to 10 weeks ge ##station . [SEP]
[CLS] medical abortion using the pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in analog mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l alone is less effective and more painful than medical abortion using a combined regime ##n of mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne and mis ##op ##ros ##to ##l or surgical abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] in the past even illegal ##ity has not automatically meant that the abortion ##s were unsafe . [SEP]
[CLS] referring to the u . s . , historian linda gordon states : " in fact , illegal abortion ##s in this country have an impressive safety record . " [SEP]
[CLS] according to rick ##ie sol ##inger , authors jerome bates and edward za ##wad ##z ##ki describe the case of an illegal abortion ##ist in the eastern u . s . in the early 20th century who was proud of having successfully completed 13 , 84 ##4 abortion ##s without any fatal ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1870s new york city the famous abortion ##ist / mid ##wife madame rest ##ell ( anna tr ##ow lo ##hman ) appears to have lost very few women among her more than 100 , 000 patients — a lower mortality rate than the childbirth mortality rate at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1936 the prominent professor of ob ##ste ##trics and g ##yne ##cology frederick j . tau ##ssi ##g wrote that a cause of increasing mortality during the years of illegal ##ity in the u . s . was that [SEP]
[CLS] current evidence finds no relationship between most induced abortion ##s and mental - health problems other than those expected for any unwanted pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] a report by the american psychological association concluded that a woman ' s first abortion is not a threat to mental health when carried out in the first trim ##ester , with such women no more likely to have mental - health problems than those carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term ; the mental - health outcome of a woman ' s second or greater abortion is less certain . [SEP]
[CLS] some older reviews concluded that abortion was associated with an increased risk of psychological problems ; however , they did not use an appropriate control group . [SEP]
[CLS] although some studies show negative mental - health outcomes in women who choose abortion ##s after the first trim ##ester because of fetal abnormalities , more rigorous research would be needed to show this con ##clusive ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] some proposed negative psychological effects of abortion have been referred to by anti - abortion advocates as a separate condition called " post - abortion syndrome " , but this is not recognized by medical or psychological professionals in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] women seeking an abortion may use unsafe methods , especially when abortion is legally restricted . [SEP]
[CLS] they may attempt self - induced abortion or seek the help of a person without proper medical training or facilities . [SEP]
[CLS] this can lead to severe complications , such as incomplete abortion , sep ##sis , hem ##or ##rh ##age , and damage to internal organs . [SEP]
[CLS] although data are imp ##re ##cise , it is estimated that approximately 20 million unsafe abortion ##s are performed annually , with 97 % taking place in developing countries . [SEP]
[CLS] to reduce the number of unsafe abortion ##s , public health organizations have generally advocated emphasizing the legal ##ization of abortion , training of medical personnel , and ensuring access to reproductive - health services . [SEP]
[CLS] in response , opponents of abortion point out that abortion ban ##s in no way affect pre ##nat ##al care for women who choose to carry their fe ##tus to term . [SEP]
[CLS] countries with restrictive abortion laws have higher rates of unsafe abortion and similar overall abortion rates compared to those where abortion is legal and available . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the 1996 legal ##ization of abortion in south africa had an immediate positive impact on the frequency of abortion - related complications , with abortion - related deaths dropping by more than 90 % . [SEP]
[CLS] similar reductions in maternal mortality have been observed after other countries have liberal ##ized their abortion laws , such as romania and nepal . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2011 study concluded that in the united states , some state - level anti - abortion laws are correlated with lower rates of abortion in that state . [SEP]
[CLS] forty percent of the world ' s women are able to access therapeutic and elect ##ive abortion ##s within ge ##station ##al limits , while an additional 35 percent have access to legal abortion if they meet certain physical , mental , or socio ##economic criteria . [SEP]
[CLS] complications of unsafe abortion account for approximately an eighth of maternal mortal ##ities worldwide , though this varies by region . [SEP]
[CLS] health education , access to family planning , and improvements in health care during and after abortion have been proposed to address this phenomenon . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2019 , a us senate bill entitled the " born - alive abortion survivors protection act " raised the issue of live birth after abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] the bill would mandate that medical providers res ##us ##cit ##ate neon ##ates delivered showing signs of life during an abortion process . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , us abortion experts ref ##ute the claim that a " born - alive " fe ##tus is a common event and reject laws that would mandate res ##us ##cit ##ation against the wishes of the parents . [SEP]
[CLS] induced fetal demise before termination of pregnancy after 20 – 21 weeks ge ##station is recommended by some sources to avoid this and to comply with the us partial birth abortion ban . [SEP]
[CLS] induced fetal demise does not improve the safety of an abortion procedure and may inc ##ur risks to the health of the woman having the abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] in many places , where abortion is illegal or carries a heavy social stigma , medical reporting of abortion is not reliable . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , estimates of the incidence of abortion must be made without determining certainty related to standard error . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of abortion ##s performed worldwide seems to have remained stable in recent years , with 41 . 6 million having been performed in 2003 and 43 . 8 million having been performed in 2008 . [SEP]
[CLS] on average , the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] the unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly at ##tri ##bu ##table to lack of access to modern contra ##ceptive ##s ; according to the gut ##tma ##cher institute , providing access to contra ##ceptive ##s would result in about 14 . 5 million fewer unsafe abortion ##s and 38 , 000 fewer deaths from unsafe abortion annually worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] the proportion of pre ##gnan ##cies that ended in induced abortion ranged from about 10 % ( israel , the netherlands and switzerland ) to 30 % ( estonia ) in the same group , though it might be as high as 36 % in hungary and romania , whose statistics were deemed incomplete . [SEP]
[CLS] inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms and three - quarters of those using the birth control pill ; 42 % of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or break ##age . [SEP]
[CLS] abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced . [SEP]
[CLS] 91 % of these were classified as having been done by " cure ##tta ##ge " ( su ##ction - as ##piration , dil ##ation and cure ##tta ##ge , dil ##ation and evacuation ) , 8 % by " medical " means ( mi ##fe ##pr ##isto ##ne ) , > 1 % by " intra ##uter ##ine ins ##till ##ation " ( saline or pro ##sta ##gl ##and ##in ) , and 1 % by " other " ( including h ##yst ##ero ##tom ##y and h ##yst ##ere ##ct ##omy ) . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the cdc , due to data collection difficulties the data must be viewed as tentative and some fetal deaths reported beyond 20 weeks may be natural deaths erroneously classified as abortion ##s if the removal of the dead fe ##tus is accomplished by the same procedure as an induced abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] the gut ##tma ##cher institute estimated there were 2 , 200 intact dil ##ation and extraction procedures in the us during 2000 ; this accounts for < 0 . 2 % of the total number of abortion ##s performed that year . [SEP]
[CLS] there are more second trim ##ester abortion ##s in developing countries such as china , india and vietnam than in developed countries . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the reasons may include an inability to afford a child , domestic violence , lack of support , feeling they are too young , and the wish to complete education or advance a career . [SEP]
[CLS] additional reasons include not being willing to raise a child conceived as a result of rape or inc ##est . [SEP]
[CLS] these factors can sometimes result in compulsory abortion or sex - selective abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] an additional factor is risk to maternal or fetal health , which was cited as the primary reason for abortion in over a third of cases in some countries and as a significant factor in only a single - digit percentage of abortion ##s in other countries . [SEP]
[CLS] in the u . s . , the supreme court decisions in " roe v . wade " and " doe v . bolton " : " ruled that the state ' s interest in the life of the fe ##tus became compelling only at the point of via ##bility , defined as the point at which the fe ##tus can survive independently of its mother . [SEP]
[CLS] public opinion shifted in america following television personality she ##rri fin ##k ##bine ' s discovery during her fifth month of pregnancy that she had been exposed to tha ##lid ##omi ##de . [SEP]
[CLS] a national opinion research center poll in 1965 showed 73 % supported abortion when the mother ' s life was at risk , 57 % when birth defects were present and 59 % for pre ##gnan ##cies resulting from rape or inc ##est . [SEP]
[CLS] the rate of cancer during pregnancy is 0 . 02 – 1 % , and in many cases , cancer of the mother leads to consideration of abortion to protect the life of the mother , or in response to the potential damage that may occur to the fe ##tus during treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] this is particularly true for cervical cancer , the most common type of which occurs in 1 of every 2 , 000 – 13 , 000 pre ##gnan ##cies , for which initiation of treatment " cannot co - exist with preservation of fetal life ( unless neo ##ad ##ju ##vant chemotherapy is chosen ) " . [SEP]
[CLS] very early stage cervical cancers ( i and ii ##a ) may be treated by radical h ##yst ##ere ##ct ##omy and pe ##l ##vic l ##ym ##ph node di ##sse ##ction , radiation therapy , or both , while later stages are treated by radio ##therapy . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations , because lump ##ect ##omy is discouraged in favor of modified radical mast ##ect ##omy unless late - term pregnancy allows follow - up radiation therapy to be administered after the birth . [SEP]
[CLS] exposure to much lower doses during the first trim ##ester , especially 8 to 15 weeks of development , can cause intellectual disability or micro ##ce ##pha ##ly , and exposure at this or subsequent stages can cause reduced intra ##uter ##ine growth and birth weight . [SEP]
[CLS] it is possible to greatly reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding , depending on how far the area to be ir ##rad ##iated is from the fe ##tus . [SEP]
[CLS] since ancient times abortion ##s have been done using herbal medicines , sharp tools , with force , or through other traditional methods . [SEP]
[CLS] there is evidence to suggest that pre ##gnan ##cies were terminated through a number of methods , including the administration of ab ##ort ##if ##ac ##ient herbs , the use of sharpened implements , the application of abdominal pressure , and other techniques . [SEP]
[CLS] found in a series of fr ##ie ##zes that represent judgment after death in hindu and buddhist culture , it depicts the technique of abdominal abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] some medical scholars and abortion opponents have suggested that the hip ##po ##cratic oath forbade ancient greek physicians from performing abortion ##s ; other scholars disagree with this interpretation , and state that the medical texts of hip ##po ##cratic corpus contain descriptions of ab ##ort ##ive techniques right alongside the oath . [SEP]
[CLS] according to so ##ran ##us ' 1st or 2nd century ce work " g ##yna ##ec ##ology " , one party of medical practitioners banished all ab ##ort ##ives as required by the hip ##po ##cratic oath ; the other party — to which he belonged — was willing to pre ##scribe abortion ##s , but only for the sake of the mother ' s health . [SEP]
[CLS] he preferred abortion in such cases , with the restriction " that it must be practised on it before it has developed sensation and life ; for the line between lawful and unlawful abortion will be marked by the fact of having sensation and being alive " . [SEP]
[CLS] in christianity , pope six ##tus v ( 158 ##5 – 90 ) was the only pope before 1869 to declare that abortion is homicide regardless of the stage of pregnancy ; and his pro ##no ##unce ##ment of 158 ##8 was reversed three years later by his successor . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , several historians have written that prior to the 19th century most catholic authors did not regard termination of pregnancy before " quick ##ening " or " en ##so ##ul ##ment " as an abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] a 1995 survey reported that catholic women are as likely as the general population to terminate a pregnancy , protestants are less likely to do so , and evangelical christians are the least likely to do so . [SEP]
[CLS] islamic tradition has traditionally permitted abortion until a point in time when muslims believe the soul enters the fe ##tus , considered by various theologians to be at conception , 40 days after conception , 120 days after conception , or quick ##ening . [SEP]
[CLS] however , abortion is largely heavily restricted or forbidden in areas of high islamic faith such as the middle east and north africa . [SEP]
[CLS] however , con ##ser ##vati ##sm by most physicians with regards to sexual matters prevented the wide expansion of safe abortion techniques . [SEP]
[CLS] other medical practitioners in addition to some physicians advertised their services , and they were not widely regulated until the 19th century , when the practice ( sometimes called " rest ##elli ##sm " ) was banned in both the united states and the united kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] in the us , according to some sources , abortion was more dangerous than childbirth until about 1930 when inc ##rem ##ental improvements in abortion procedures relative to childbirth made abortion safer . [SEP]
[CLS] however , other sources maintain that in the 19th century early abortion ##s under the h ##y ##gie ##nic conditions in which mid ##wives usually worked were relatively safe . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , some commentators have written that , despite improved medical procedures , the period from the 1930s until legal ##ization also saw more ze ##alo ##us enforcement of anti - abortion laws , and con ##com ##itan ##tly an increasing control of abortion providers by organized crime . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1935 nazi germany , a law was passed permitting abortion ##s for those deemed " here ##dit ##ari ##ly ill " , while women considered of german stock were specifically prohibited from having abortion ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning in the second half of the twentieth century , abortion was legal ##ized in a greater number of countries . [SEP]
[CLS] in both public and private debate , arguments presented in favor of or against abortion access focus on either the moral per ##mis ##sibility of an induced abortion , or justification of laws permitting or restricting abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] the world medical association declaration on therapeutic abortion notes , " circumstances bringing the interests of a mother into conflict with the interests of her un ##born child create a dilemma and raise the question as to whether or not the pregnancy should be deliberately terminated . " [SEP]
[CLS] abortion debates , especially pertaining to abortion laws , are often spearheaded by groups advocating one of these two positions . [SEP]
[CLS] anti - abortion groups who favor greater legal restrictions on abortion , including complete prohibition , most often describe themselves as " pro - life " while abortion rights groups who are against such legal restrictions describe themselves as " pro - choice " . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , the former position argues that a human fe ##tus is a human person with a right to live , making abortion morally the same as murder . [SEP]
[CLS] the latter position argues that a woman has certain reproductive rights , especially the right to decide whether or not to carry a pregnancy to term . [SEP]
[CLS] in jurisdictions where abortion is legal , certain requirements must often be met before a woman may obtain a safe , legal abortion ( an abortion performed without the woman ' s consent is considered fe ##tic ##ide ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some jurisdictions require a waiting period before the procedure , pre ##scribe the distribution of information on fetal development , or require that parents be contacted if their minor daughter requests an abortion . [SEP]
[CLS] other jurisdictions may require that a woman obtain the consent of the fe ##tus ' father before ab ##ort ##ing the fe ##tus , that abortion providers inform women of health risks of the procedure — sometimes including " risks " not supported by the medical literature — and that multiple medical authorities ce ##rti ##fy that the abortion is either medical ##ly or socially necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] these circumstances vary based on jurisdiction , but may include whether the pregnancy is a result of rape or inc ##est , the fe ##tus ' development is impaired , the woman ' s physical or mental well - being is endangered , or socio ##economic considerations make childbirth a hardship . [SEP]
[CLS] in countries where abortion is banned entirely , such as nicaragua , medical authorities have recorded rises in maternal death directly and indirectly due to pregnancy as well as deaths due to doctors ' fears of prosecution if they treat other g ##yne ##col ##ogical emergencies . [SEP]
[CLS] some countries , such as bangladesh , that nominally ban abortion , may also support clinics that perform abortion ##s under the guise of men ##st ##ru ##al hygiene . [SEP]
[CLS] in places where abortion is illegal or carries heavy social stigma , pregnant women may engage in medical tourism and travel to countries where they can terminate their pre ##gnan ##cies . [SEP]
[CLS] women without the means to travel can resort to providers of illegal abortion ##s or attempt to perform an abortion by themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] the ngo created a mobile medical clinic inside a shipping container , which then travels on rented ships to countries with restrictive abortion laws . [SEP]
[CLS] because the ships are registered in the netherlands , dutch law pre ##va ##ils when the ship is in international waters . [SEP]
[CLS] while in port , the organization provides free workshops and education ; while in international waters , medical personnel are legally able to pre ##scribe medical abortion drugs and counseling . [SEP]
[CLS] son ##ography and am ##nio ##cent ##esis allow parents to determine sex before childbirth . [SEP]
[CLS] the preference for male children is reported in many areas of asia , and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in taiwan , south korea , india , and china . [SEP]
[CLS] this deviation from the standard birth rates of males and females occurs despite the fact that the country in question may have officially banned sex - selective abortion or even sex - screening . [SEP]
[CLS] at the international conference on population and development in 1994 over 180 states agreed to eliminate " all forms of discrimination against the girl child and the root causes of son preference " , conditions also condemned by a pace resolution in 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] the world health organization and unicef , along with other united nations agencies , have found that measures to reduce access to abortion are much less effective at reducing sex - selective abortion ##s than measures to reduce gender inequality . [SEP]
[CLS] in a number of cases , abortion providers and these facilities have been subjected to various forms of violence , including murder , attempted murder , kidnapping , stalking , assault , arson , and bombing . [SEP]
[CLS] in the u . s . and canada , over 8 , 000 incidents of violence , tres ##pass ##ing , and death threats have been recorded by providers since 1977 , including over 200 bombings / arson ##s and hundreds of assaults . [SEP]
[CLS] also murdered , in the u . s . and australia , have been other personnel at abortion clinics , including receptionist ##s and security guards such as james barrett , shannon low ##ney , lee ann nichols , and robert sanders ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] wounding ##s ( e . g . , ga ##rson roma ##lis ) and attempted murders have also taken place in the united states and canada . [SEP]
[CLS] notable perpetrators of anti - abortion violence include eric robert rudolph , scott roe ##der , shelley shannon , and paul jennings hill , the first person to be executed in the united states for murdering an abortion provider . [SEP]
[CLS] legal protection of access to abortion has been brought into some countries where abortion is legal . [SEP]
[CLS] these laws typically seek to protect abortion clinics from obstruction , van ##dal ##ism , picket ##ing , and other actions , or to protect women and employees of such facilities from threats and harassment . [SEP]
[CLS] the organizations released the personal information online , of those involved with construction , sending them up to 1200 phone calls a day and contact ##ing their churches . [SEP]
[CLS] several plants , including broom ##weed , sk ##unk cabbage , poison hem ##lock , and tree tobacco , are known to cause fetal def ##or ##mit ##ies and abortion in cattle and in sheep and goats . [SEP]
[CLS] in horses , a fe ##tus may be ab ##orted or res ##or ##bed if it has lethal white syndrome ( congenital int ##estinal ag ##ang ##lion ##osis ) . [SEP]
[CLS] female rodents may terminate a pregnancy when exposed to the smell of a male not responsible for the pregnancy , known as the bruce effect . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , abortion may be induced in mare ##s that have been mated improper ##ly , or that have been purchased by owners who did not realize the mare ##s were pregnant , or that are pregnant with twin f ##oa ##ls . [SEP]
[CLS] fe ##tic ##ide can occur in horses and zebra ##s due to male harassment of pregnant mare ##s or forced cop ##ulation , although the frequency in the wild has been questioned . [SEP]
