a hysterotomy abortion is a procedure similar to a caesarean section .
it requires a smaller cut than a caesarean section .
gravid hysterectomy is surgery to remove the whole uterus while taking care of the pregnancy .
hysterotomy and hysterectomy are associated with much higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality than d & e or induction abortion .
in places that have necessary medical skill for dilation and extraction , or where preferred by practitioners , an abortion can be induced by first inducing labor and then inducing fetal demise if necessary .
in the united states , many abortions are labor-induced abortions in sweden and other nearby countries .

in the past , even illegality has not automatically meant that abortions were unsafe .
historian linda gordon said : " in fact , illegal abortions in this country have an impressive safety record . "
the authors jerome bates and edward zawadzki describe the case of an illegal abortionist in the early 20th century who was proud of having completed 13,844 abortions without any fatality .
in 1870s , the famous abortionist madame restellheimer -lrb- anna trow -rrb- lohmanhmanhman foley , appears to have lost very few women among her more than 100,000 patients .
in 1936 the prominent professor of obstetrics and gynecology frederick j . taussig wrote that a cause of increasing mortality during the years of illegality in the u . s . was that that that there was a cause of increasing deaths in the us was that in the united states was that in the united states was that was that .
current evidence finds no relationship between most induced abortions and mental-health problems other than those expected for any unwanted pregnancy .

some older reviews said that abortion was associated with an increased risk of psychological problems .
some studies show that negative mental health results in women who choose abortions after the first trimester because of fetal abnormalities , more rigorous research would be needed to show this conclusively .

women seeking an abortion may use unsafe methods , especially when abortion is legally restricted .
they may try to seek the help of a person without proper medical training or facilities .
this can lead to severe complications , such as incomplete abortion , sepsis , hemorrhage , and damage to internal organs .
about 20 million unsafe abortions are performed annually , with 97 % taking place in developing countries .
to reduce the number of unsafe abortions , public health organizations have generally advocated the legalization of abortion , training of medical personnel , and ensuring access to reproductive-health services .
in response , opponents of abortion say that abortion bans in no way affect prenatal care for women who choose to carry their fetus to term .
countries with restrictive abortion laws have higher rates of unsafe abortion .
for example , the 1996 legalization of abortion in south africa had an immediate positive effect on the frequency of abortion-related complications , with abortion-related deaths dropping by more than 90 % .
similar reductions in maternal mortality have been observed after other countries have liberalized their abortion laws , such as romania and nepal .
in the united states , there are some state-level anti-abortion laws .
forty percent of the world 's women are able to access therapeutic and elective abortions within gestational limits .
complications of unsafe abortion account for approximately an eighth of maternal mortalities worldwide , though this varies by region .

inconsistent use was reported by half of those using condoms .
abortion rates also vary depending on the type of pregnancy .
91 % of these were said to be done by " curettage "chment , dilation and evacuation .

for example , initiation of treatment is performed with preservation of fetal life unless neoadjuvant chemotherapy is chosen .
very early stage cervical cancers may be treated by radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection , radiation therapy , or both , while later stages are treated by radiotherapy .
treatment of breast cancer during pregnancy also involves fetal considerations .
exposure to much lower doses during the first trimester , especially 8 to 15 weeks of development , can cause intellectual disability or microcephaly .
it is possible to reduce exposure to radiation with abdominal shielding , depending on how far the area to be irradiated is from the fetus .
traditionally abortions have been done using herbal medicines , sharp tools , or with force .
there is evidence to suggest that pregnancies were terminated through a number of methods .
it shows the technique of abdominal abortion .
