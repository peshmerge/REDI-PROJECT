[CLS] griffith ' s findings were followed by research in the late 1930s and early 40 ##s that isolated dna as the material that communicated this genetic information . [SEP]
[CLS] the iii - s strain synthesized a poly ##sa ##cc ##hari ##de capsule that protected itself from the host ' s immune system , resulting in the death of the host , while the ii - r strain did not have that protective capsule and was defeated by the host ' s immune system . [SEP]
[CLS] a german ba ##cter ##iol ##ogist , fred ne ##uf ##eld , had discovered the three p ##ne ##um ##oco ##cca ##l types ( types i , ii , and iii ) and discovered the que ##ll ##ung reaction to identify them in vitro . [SEP]
[CLS] griffith concluded that the type ii - r had been " transformed " into the lethal iii - s strain by a " transforming principle " that was somehow part of the dead iii - s strain bacteria . [SEP]
[CLS] today , we know that the " transforming principle " griffith observed was the dna of the iii - s strain bacteria . [SEP]
[CLS] while the bacteria had been killed , the dna had survived the heating process and was taken up by the ii - r strain bacteria . [SEP]
[CLS] the iii - s strain dna contains the genes that form the smooth protective poly ##sa ##cc ##hari ##de capsule . [SEP]
[CLS] equipped with this gene , the former ii - r strain bacteria were now protected from the host ' s immune system and could kill the host . [SEP]
[CLS] the exact nature of the transforming principle ( dna ) was verified in the experiments done by avery , mcleod and mcc ##arty and by hers ##hey and chase . [SEP]
