griffith 's findings were followed by research in the late 1930s and early 40s that isolated dna as the material that communicated this genetic information .
the iii-s strain also created a polysaccharide capsule that protects itself from the host 's immune system .
a german bacteriologist , fred neufeld , discovered the three pneumococcal types i , ii , and iiieux and found the quellung reaction to identify them in vitro .
griffith concluded that the type ii-r had been " transformed " into the lethal iii-s strain by a " transforming principle " that was somehow part of the dead iii-s strain bacteria .
today , we know that the " transforming principle " griffith observed was the dna of the iii-s strain bacteria .
the dna was taken up by the ii-r strain bacteria .
the iii-s strain dna contains the genes that form the protective polysaccharide part of the dna .
with this gene , the former ii-r strain bacteria were now protected from the host 's immune system and could kill the host .
avery , mcleod and mccarty and hershey and chase made the exact nature of the transforming principle .
