[CLS] romantic music is a stylistic movement in western classical music associated with the period spanning the nineteenth century , commonly referred to as the romantic era ( or romantic period ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it is closely related to the broader concept of romantic ##ism â€” the intellectual , artistic and literary movement that became prominent in western europe from approximately 1800 until 1850 . [SEP]
[CLS] romantic composers sought to create music that was individual ##istic , emotional , dramatic and often program ##matic ; reflecting broader trends within the movements of romantic literature , poetry , art and philosophy . [SEP]
[CLS] romantic music was often ostensibly inspired by ( or else sought to ev ##oke ) non - musical stimuli , such as nature , literature , poetry or the plastic arts . [SEP]
[CLS] influential composers of the early romantic era include ludwig van beethoven ( in his later works ) , franz schubert , felix men ##del ##sso ##hn , john field , gi ##oa ##chin ##o rossi ##ni , vincenzo bell ##ini , ga ##etano don ##ize ##tti , giacomo meyer ##bee ##r , robert schumann , frederic chopin , hector be ##rl ##io ##z , franz liszt , and richard wagner . [SEP]
[CLS] later nineteenth - century composers would appear to build upon certain early romantic ideas and musical techniques , such as the use of extended ch ##romatic harmony and expanded orchestra ##tion . [SEP]
[CLS] such later romantic composers include br ##uck ##ner , brahms , tchaikovsky , d ##vor ##ak , ma ##hler , richard strauss , pu ##cci ##ni , si ##bel ##ius , el ##gar , gr ##ieg , saint - sa ##ens , fa ##ure , ra ##chman ##ino ##ff and fran ##ck . [SEP]
[CLS] the romantic movement was an artistic , literary , and intellectual movement that originated in the second half of the 18th century in europe and strengthened in reaction to the industrial revolution . [SEP]
[CLS] in part , it was a revolt against social and political norms of the age of enlightenment and a reaction against the scientific rational ##ization of nature . [SEP]
[CLS] it was embodied most strongly in the visual arts , music , and literature , but had a major impact on his ##tori ##ography and education , and was in turn influenced by developments in natural history . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the first significant applications of the term to music was in 1789 , in the " memoir ##es " by the frenchman andre gr ##et ##ry , but it was e . t . a . hoffmann who really established the principles of musical romantic ##ism , in a lengthy review of ludwig van beethoven ' s fifth symphony published in 1810 , and in an 1813 article on beethoven ' s instrumental music . [SEP]
[CLS] in the first of these essays hoffmann traced the beginnings of musical romantic ##ism to the later works of haydn and mozart . [SEP]
[CLS] it was hoffmann ' s fusion of ideas already associated with the term " romantic " , used in opposition to the restraint and formal ##ity of classical models , that elevated music , and especially instrumental music , to a position of pre - emi ##nen ##ce in romantic ##ism as the art most suited to the expression of emotions . [SEP]
[CLS] it was also through the writings of hoffmann and other german authors that german music was brought to the centre of musical romantic ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] characteristics often attributed to romantic ##ism : such lists , however , pro ##life ##rated over time , resulting in a " chaos of anti ##the ##tical phenomena " , criticized for their superficial ##ity and for sign ##ifying so many different things that there came to be no central meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] the attributes have also been criticized for being too vague . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , features of the " ghostly and supernatural " could apply equally to mozart ' s " don giovanni " from 1787 and st ##ra ##vinsky ' s " the rake ' s progress " from 1951 . [SEP]
[CLS] in music there is a relatively clear dividing line in musical structure and form following the death of beethoven . [SEP]
[CLS] whether one counts beethoven as a " romantic " composer or not , the breadth and power of his work gave rise to a feeling that the classical sonata form and , indeed , the structure of the symphony , sonata and string quartet had been exhausted . [SEP]
[CLS] schumann , schubert , be ##rl ##io ##z and other early - romantic composers tended to look in alternative directions . [SEP]
[CLS] events and changes in society such as ideas , attitudes , discoveries , inventions , and historical events often affect music . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the industrial revolution was in full effect by the late 18th century and early 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] this event had a profound effect on music : there were major improvements in the mechanical valves and keys that most wood ##wind ##s and brass instruments depend on . [SEP]
[CLS] the new and innovative instruments could be played with greater ease and they were more reliable . [SEP]
[CLS] another development that had an effect on music was the rise of the middle class . [SEP]
[CLS] composers before this period lived on the patronage of the aristocracy . [SEP]
[CLS] many times their audience was small , composed mostly of the upper class and individuals who were knowledge ##able about music . [SEP]
[CLS] the romantic composers , on the other hand , often wrote for public concerts and festivals , with large audiences of paying customers , who had not necessarily had any music lessons . [SEP]
[CLS] composers of the romantic era , like el ##gar , showed the world that there should be " no segregation of musical tastes " and that the " purpose was to write music that was to be heard " . [SEP]
[CLS] during the romantic period , music often took on a much more nationalist ##ic purpose . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , jean si ##bel ##ius ' " finland ##ia " has been interpreted to represent the rising nation of finland , which would someday gain independence from russian control . [SEP]
[CLS] frederic chopin was one of the first composers to incorporate nationalist ##ic elements into his compositions . [SEP]
[CLS] joseph mach ##lis states , " poland ' s struggle for freedom from tsar ##ist rule aroused the national poet in poland . [SEP]
[CLS] . . . examples of musical nationalism ab ##ound in the output of the romantic era . [SEP]
[CLS] the folk id ##iom is prominent in the ma ##zu ##rka ##s of chopin " . [SEP]
[CLS] his ma ##zu ##rka ##s and polo ##nais ##es are particularly notable for their use of nationalist ##ic rhythms . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , " during world war ii the nazis forbade the playing of . . . chopin ' s polo ##nais ##es in warsaw because of the powerful symbolism residing in these works " . [SEP]
[CLS] other composers , such as bed ##rich sm ##eta ##na , wrote pieces that musically described their homeland ##s ; in particular , sm ##eta ##na ' s " v ##lta ##va " is a symphonic poem about the mold ##au river in the modern - day czech republic and the second in a cycle of six nationalist ##ic symphonic poems collectively titled " ma v ##las ##t " ( my homeland ) . [SEP]
[CLS] sm ##eta ##na also composed eight nationalist operas , all of which remain in the repertory . [SEP]
[CLS] they established him as the first czech nationalist composer as well as the most important czech opera composer of the generation who came to prominence in the 1860s . [SEP]
