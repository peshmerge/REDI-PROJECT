[CLS] since " martyrs " was delayed , the composer had time to write the music for " la fill ##e du regiment " , his first opera set to a french text , as well as to stage the french version of " lucia di lam ##mer ##moor " as " lucie de lam ##mer ##moor " . [SEP]
[CLS] " la fill ##e du regiment " quickly became a popular success partly because of the famous aria " " ah ! [SEP]

" [SEP]
[CLS] the source of be ##rl ##io ##z ' s hostility is revealed later in his review : what , two major scores for the opera , " les martyrs " and " le duc d ' al ##be " , two others at the theatre de la renaissance , " lucie de lam ##mer ##moor " and " l ' ang ##e de ni ##si ##da " , two at the opera - com ##ique , " la fill ##e du regiment " and another whose title is still unknown , and yet another for the theatre - it ##ali ##en , will have been written or transcribed in one year by the same composer !
