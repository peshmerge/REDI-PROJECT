An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.
However, because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP (IPv6), using 128 bits for the IP address, was developed in 1995, and standardized in none }} .
The IP address space is managed globally by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and by five regional Internet registries (RIRs) responsible in their designated territories for assignment to end users and local Internet registries, such as Internet service providers.
IPv4 addresses have been distributed by IANA to the RIRs in blocks of approximately 16.8 million addresses each.
Each ISP or private network administrator assigns an IP address to each device connected to its network.
It identifies the host, or more specifically its network interface, and it provides the location of the host in the network, and thus the capability of establishing a path to that host.
Two versions of the Internet Protocol are in common use in the Internet today.
The original version of the Internet Protocol that was first deployed in 1983 in the ARPANET, the predecessor of the Internet, is Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4).
The rapid exhaustion of IPv4 address space available for assignment to Internet service providers and end user organizations by the early 1990s, prompted the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to explore new technologies to expand the addressing capability in the Internet.
The result was a redesign of the Internet Protocol which became eventually known as Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) in 1995.
Today, these two versions of the Internet Protocol are in simultaneous use.
The gap in version sequence between IPv4 and IPv6 resulted from the assignment of version 5 to the experimental Internet Stream Protocol in 1979, which however was never referred to as IPv5.
For this purpose, an IP address is recognized as consisting of two parts: the "network prefix" in the high-order bits and the remaining bits called the "rest field", "host identifier", or "interface identifier" (IPv6), used for host numbering within a network.
The subnet mask or CIDR notation determines how the IP address is divided into network and host parts.
In this, the IP address is followed by a slash and the number (in decimal) of bits used for the network part, also called the "routing prefix".
The CIDR notation for the same IP address and subnet is "192.0.2.1/24" , because the first 24 bits of the IP address indicate the network and subnet.
Of this number, some addresses are reserved for special purposes such as private networks (~18 million addresses) and multicast addressing (~270 million addresses).
In some cases of technical writing, IPv4 addresses may be presented in various hexadecimal, octal, or binary representations.
In the early stages of development of the Internet Protocol, the network number was always the highest order octet (most significant eight bits).
Because this method allowed for only 256 networks, it soon proved inadequate as additional networks developed that were independent of the existing networks already designated by a network number.
Depending on the class derived, the network identification was based on octet boundary segments of the entire address.
Each class used successively additional octets in the network identifier, thus reducing the possible number of hosts in the higher order classes ("B" and "C").
Classful network design served its purpose in the startup stage of the Internet, but it lacked scalability in the face of the rapid expansion of networking in the 1990s.
The class system of the address space was replaced with Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) in 1993.
Today, remnants of classful network concepts function only in a limited scope as the default configuration parameters of some network software and hardware components (e.g.
However, it was found that this was not always necessary as private networks developed and public address space needed to be conserved.
Computers not connected to the Internet, such as factory machines that communicate only with each other via TCP/IP, need not have globally unique IP addresses.
Today, such private networks are widely used and typically connect to the Internet with network address translation (NAT), when needed.
These addresses are not routed on the Internet and thus their use need not be coordinated with an IP address registry.
Any user may use any of the reserved blocks.
The intent of the new design was not to provide just a sufficient quantity of addresses, but also redesign routing in the Internet by allowing more efficient aggregation of subnetwork routing prefixes.
The smallest possible individual allocation is a subnet for 2 hosts, which is the square of the size of the entire IPv4 Internet.
The new design also provides the opportunity to separate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment, i.e.
the local administration of the segment's available space, from the addressing prefix used to route traffic to and from external networks.
IPv6 has facilities that automatically change the routing prefix of entire networks, should the global connectivity or the routing policy change, without requiring internal redesign or manual renumbering.
With a large address space, there is no need to have complex address conservation methods as used in CIDR.
All modern desktop and enterprise server operating systems include native support for the IPv6 protocol, but it is not yet widely deployed in other devices, such as residential networking routers, voice over IP (VoIP) and multimedia equipment, and some networking hardware.
The addresses include a 40-bit pseudorandom number that minimizes the risk of address collisions if sites merge or packets are misrouted.
However, the definition of what constituted a "site" remained unclear and the poorly defined addressing policy created ambiguities for routing.
Addresses starting with "fe80::" , called link-local addresses, are assigned to interfaces for communication on the attached link.
This feature is used in the lower layers of IPv6 network administration, such as for the Neighbor Discovery Protocol.
Private and link-local address prefixes may not be routed on the public Internet.
IP addresses are assigned to a host either dynamically as they join the network, or persistently by configuration of the host hardware or software.
DHCP is the most frequently used technology for assigning addresses.
It avoids the administrative burden of assigning specific static addresses to each device on a network.
It also allows devices to share the limited address space on a network if only some of them are online at a particular time.
The address assigned with DHCP is associated with a "lease" and usually has an expiration period.
Some DHCP implementations attempt to reassign the same IP address to a host (based on its MAC address) each time it joins the network.
A network administrator may configure DHCP by allocating specific IP addresses based on MAC address.
Dialup and some broadband networks use dynamic address features of the Point-to-Point Protocol.
In the absence or failure of static or dynamic address configurations, an operating system may assign a link-local address to a host using stateless address autoconfiguration.
A "sticky dynamic IP address" is an informal term used by cable and DSL Internet access subscribers to describe a dynamically assigned IP address which seldom changes.
Since the modems are usually powered on for extended periods of time, the address leases are usually set to long periods and simply renewed.
If a modem is turned off and powered up again before the next expiration of the address lease, it often receives the same IP address.
In IPv6, every interface, whether using static or dynamic address assignments, also receives a link-local address automatically in the block "fe80::/10" .
These addresses are only valid on the link, such as a local network segment or point-to-point connection, to which a host is connected.
These addresses are not routable and, like private addresses, cannot be the source or destination of packets traversing the Internet.
When the link-local IPv4 address block was reserved, no standards existed for mechanisms of address autoconfiguration.
APIPA has been deployed on millions of machines and became a de facto standard in the industry.
An IP address conflict occurs when two devices on the same local physical or wireless network claim to have the same IP address.
A second assignment of an address generally stops the IP functionality of one or both of the devices.
When IP addresses are assigned by multiple people and systems with differing methods, any of them may be at fault.
It normally refers to a single sender or a single receiver, and can be used for both sending and receiving.
Usually, a unicast address is associated with a single device or host, but a device or host may have more than one unicast address.
Sending the same data to multiple unicast addresses requires the sender to send all the data many times over, once for each recipient.
In addition, a more limited directed broadcast uses the all-ones host address with the network prefix.
IPv6 does not implement broadcast addressing, and replaces it with multicast to the specially defined all-nodes multicast address.
In either case, the sender sends a single datagram from its unicast address to the multicast group address and the intermediary routers take care of making copies and sending them to all interested receivers (those that have joined the corresponding multicast group).
However, the data stream is not transmitted to all receivers, just the one which the router decides is logically closest in the network.
Anycast address is an inherent feature of only IPv6.
In IPv4, anycast addressing implementations typically operate using the shortest-path metric of BGP routing and do not take into account congestion or other attributes of the path.
A public IP address, in common parlance, is a globally routable unicast IP address, meaning that the address is not an address reserved for use in private networks, such as those reserved by , or the various IPv6 address formats of local scope or site-local scope, for example for link-local addressing.
Public IP addresses may be used for communication between hosts on the global Internet.
The source and destination IP addresses contained in the headers of each IP packet are a convenient means to discriminate traffic by IP address blocking or by selectively tailoring responses to external requests to internal servers.
Multiple client devices can appear to share an IP address, either because they are part of a shared hosting web server environment or because an IPv4 network address translator (NAT) or proxy server acts as an intermediary agent on behalf of the client, in which case the real originating IP address might be masked from the server receiving a request.
A common practice is to have a NAT mask a large number of devices in a private network.
Commonly, the NAT device maps TCP or UDP port numbers on the side of the larger, public network to individual private addresses on the masqueraded network.
In this scenario, the computers connected to the router have private IP addresses and the router has a public address on its external interface to communicate on the Internet.
Microsoft Windows provides the command-line interface tools ipconfig and netsh and users of Unix-like systems may use ifconfig, netstat, route, lanstat, fstat, and iproute2 utilities to accomplish the task.
