[CLS] an internet protocol address ( ip address ) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the internet protocol for communication . [SEP]
[CLS] however , because of the growth of the internet and the de ##ple ##tion of available ip ##v ##4 addresses , a new version of ip ( ip ##v ##6 ) , using 128 bits for the ip address , was developed in 1995 , and standardized in none } } . [SEP]
[CLS] the ip address space is managed globally by the internet assigned numbers authority ( ian ##a ) , and by five regional internet regis ##tries ( ri ##rs ) responsible in their designated territories for assignment to end users and local internet regis ##tries , such as internet service providers . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##4 addresses have been distributed by ian ##a to the ri ##rs in blocks of approximately 16 . 8 million addresses each . [SEP]
[CLS] each is ##p or private network administrator assigns an ip address to each device connected to its network . [SEP]
[CLS] it identifies the host , or more specifically its network interface , and it provides the location of the host in the network , and thus the capability of establishing a path to that host . [SEP]
[CLS] two versions of the internet protocol are in common use in the internet today . [SEP]
[CLS] the original version of the internet protocol that was first deployed in 1983 in the ar ##pan ##et , the predecessor of the internet , is internet protocol version 4 ( ip ##v ##4 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the rapid exhaustion of ip ##v ##4 address space available for assignment to internet service providers and end user organizations by the early 1990s , prompted the internet engineering task force ( ie ##tf ) to explore new technologies to expand the addressing capability in the internet . [SEP]
[CLS] the result was a redesign of the internet protocol which became eventually known as internet protocol version 6 ( ip ##v ##6 ) in 1995 . [SEP]
[CLS] today , these two versions of the internet protocol are in simultaneous use . [SEP]
[CLS] the gap in version sequence between ip ##v ##4 and ip ##v ##6 resulted from the assignment of version 5 to the experimental internet stream protocol in 1979 , which however was never referred to as ip ##v ##5 . [SEP]
[CLS] for this purpose , an ip address is recognized as consisting of two parts : the " network prefix " in the high - order bits and the remaining bits called the " rest field " , " host id ##ent ##ifier " , or " interface id ##ent ##ifier " ( ip ##v ##6 ) , used for host numbering within a network . [SEP]
[CLS] the sub ##net mask or cid ##r notation determines how the ip address is divided into network and host parts . [SEP]
[CLS] in this , the ip address is followed by a slash and the number ( in decimal ) of bits used for the network part , also called the " routing prefix " . [SEP]
[CLS] the cid ##r notation for the same ip address and sub ##net is " 192 . 0 . 2 . 1 / 24 " , because the first 24 bits of the ip address indicate the network and sub ##net . [SEP]
[CLS] of this number , some addresses are reserved for special purposes such as private networks ( ~ 18 million addresses ) and multi ##cast addressing ( ~ 270 million addresses ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in some cases of technical writing , ip ##v ##4 addresses may be presented in various he ##xa ##de ##ci ##mal , oct ##al , or binary representations . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early stages of development of the internet protocol , the network number was always the highest order oct ##et ( most significant eight bits ) . [SEP]
[CLS] because this method allowed for only 256 networks , it soon proved inadequate as additional networks developed that were independent of the existing networks already designated by a network number . [SEP]
[CLS] depending on the class derived , the network identification was based on oct ##et boundary segments of the entire address . [SEP]
[CLS] each class used successively additional oct ##ets in the network id ##ent ##ifier , thus reducing the possible number of hosts in the higher order classes ( " b " and " c " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] class ##ful network design served its purpose in the startup stage of the internet , but it lacked scala ##bility in the face of the rapid expansion of networking in the 1990s . [SEP]
[CLS] the class system of the address space was replaced with class ##less inter - domain routing ( cid ##r ) in 1993 . [SEP]
[CLS] today , remnants of class ##ful network concepts function only in a limited scope as the default configuration parameters of some network software and hardware components ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it was found that this was not always necessary as private networks developed and public address space needed to be conserved . [SEP]
[CLS] computers not connected to the internet , such as factory machines that communicate only with each other via tc ##p / ip , need not have globally unique ip addresses . [SEP]
[CLS] today , such private networks are widely used and typically connect to the internet with network address translation ( nat ) , when needed . [SEP]
[CLS] these addresses are not routed on the internet and thus their use need not be coordinated with an ip address registry . [SEP]
[CLS] any user may use any of the reserved blocks . [SEP]
[CLS] the intent of the new design was not to provide just a sufficient quantity of addresses , but also redesign routing in the internet by allowing more efficient aggregation of sub ##net ##work routing prefix ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] the smallest possible individual allocation is a sub ##net for 2 hosts , which is the square of the size of the entire ip ##v ##4 internet . [SEP]
[CLS] the new design also provides the opportunity to separate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment , i . e . [SEP]
[CLS] the local administration of the segment ' s available space , from the addressing prefix used to route traffic to and from external networks . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##6 has facilities that automatically change the routing prefix of entire networks , should the global connectivity or the routing policy change , without requiring internal redesign or manual ren ##umber ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] with a large address space , there is no need to have complex address conservation methods as used in cid ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] all modern desktop and enterprise server operating systems include native support for the ip ##v ##6 protocol , but it is not yet widely deployed in other devices , such as residential networking route ##rs , voice over ip ( vo ##ip ) and multimedia equipment , and some networking hardware . [SEP]
[CLS] the addresses include a 40 - bit pseudo ##rand ##om number that minimize ##s the risk of address collisions if sites merge or packets are mis ##routed . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the definition of what constituted a " site " remained unclear and the poorly defined addressing policy created am ##bi ##gui ##ties for routing . [SEP]
[CLS] addresses starting with " fe ##80 : : " , called link - local addresses , are assigned to interfaces for communication on the attached link . [SEP]
[CLS] this feature is used in the lower layers of ip ##v ##6 network administration , such as for the neighbor discovery protocol . [SEP]
[CLS] private and link - local address prefix ##es may not be routed on the public internet . [SEP]
[CLS] ip addresses are assigned to a host either dynamic ##ally as they join the network , or persistent ##ly by configuration of the host hardware or software . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##cp is the most frequently used technology for assign ##ing addresses . [SEP]
[CLS] it avoids the administrative burden of assign ##ing specific static addresses to each device on a network . [SEP]
[CLS] it also allows devices to share the limited address space on a network if only some of them are online at a particular time . [SEP]
[CLS] the address assigned with dh ##cp is associated with a " lease " and usually has an ex ##piration period . [SEP]
[CLS] some dh ##cp implementations attempt to re ##ass ##ign the same ip address to a host ( based on its mac address ) each time it joins the network . [SEP]
[CLS] a network administrator may con ##fi ##gur ##e dh ##cp by all ##ocating specific ip addresses based on mac address . [SEP]
[CLS] dial ##up and some broadband networks use dynamic address features of the point - to - point protocol . [SEP]
[CLS] in the absence or failure of static or dynamic address configurations , an operating system may assign a link - local address to a host using state ##less address auto ##con ##fi ##gur ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] a " sticky dynamic ip address " is an informal term used by cable and ds ##l internet access subscribers to describe a dynamic ##ally assigned ip address which seldom changes . [SEP]
[CLS] since the mode ##ms are usually powered on for extended periods of time , the address leases are usually set to long periods and simply renewed . [SEP]
[CLS] if a mode ##m is turned off and powered up again before the next ex ##piration of the address lease , it often receives the same ip address . [SEP]
[CLS] in ip ##v ##6 , every interface , whether using static or dynamic address assignments , also receives a link - local address automatically in the block " fe ##80 : : / 10 " . [SEP]
[CLS] these addresses are only valid on the link , such as a local network segment or point - to - point connection , to which a host is connected . [SEP]
[CLS] these addresses are not ro ##utable and , like private addresses , cannot be the source or destination of packets travers ##ing the internet . [SEP]
[CLS] when the link - local ip ##v ##4 address block was reserved , no standards existed for mechanisms of address auto ##con ##fi ##gur ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] api ##pa has been deployed on millions of machines and became a de facto standard in the industry . [SEP]
[CLS] an ip address conflict occurs when two devices on the same local physical or wireless network claim to have the same ip address . [SEP]
[CLS] a second assignment of an address generally stops the ip functionality of one or both of the devices . [SEP]
[CLS] when ip addresses are assigned by multiple people and systems with differing methods , any of them may be at fault . [SEP]
[CLS] it normally refers to a single send ##er or a single receiver , and can be used for both sending and receiving . [SEP]
[CLS] usually , a un ##ica ##st address is associated with a single device or host , but a device or host may have more than one un ##ica ##st address . [SEP]
[CLS] sending the same data to multiple un ##ica ##st addresses requires the send ##er to send all the data many times over , once for each recipient . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , a more limited directed broadcast uses the all - ones host address with the network prefix . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##6 does not implement broadcast addressing , and replaces it with multi ##cast to the specially defined all - nodes multi ##cast address . [SEP]
[CLS] in either case , the send ##er sends a single data ##gram from its un ##ica ##st address to the multi ##cast group address and the inter ##media ##ry route ##rs take care of making copies and sending them to all interested receivers ( those that have joined the corresponding multi ##cast group ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the data stream is not transmitted to all receivers , just the one which the route ##r decides is logical ##ly closest in the network . [SEP]
[CLS] any ##cast address is an inherent feature of only ip ##v ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] in ip ##v ##4 , any ##cast addressing implementations typically operate using the shortest - path metric of b ##gp routing and do not take into account congestion or other attributes of the path . [SEP]
[CLS] a public ip address , in common par ##lance , is a globally ro ##utable un ##ica ##st ip address , meaning that the address is not an address reserved for use in private networks , such as those reserved by , or the various ip ##v ##6 address formats of local scope or site - local scope , for example for link - local addressing . [SEP]
[CLS] public ip addresses may be used for communication between hosts on the global internet . [SEP]
[CLS] the source and destination ip addresses contained in the header ##s of each ip packet are a convenient means to disc ##rim ##inate traffic by ip address blocking or by selective ##ly tailor ##ing responses to external requests to internal servers . [SEP]
[CLS] multiple client devices can appear to share an ip address , either because they are part of a shared hosting web server environment or because an ip ##v ##4 network address translator ( nat ) or proxy server acts as an inter ##media ##ry agent on behalf of the client , in which case the real originating ip address might be masked from the server receiving a request . [SEP]
[CLS] a common practice is to have a nat mask a large number of devices in a private network . [SEP]
[CLS] commonly , the nat device maps tc ##p or ud ##p port numbers on the side of the larger , public network to individual private addresses on the mas ##que ##rade ##d network . [SEP]
[CLS] in this scenario , the computers connected to the route ##r have private ip addresses and the route ##r has a public address on its external interface to communicate on the internet . [SEP]
[CLS] microsoft windows provides the command - line interface tools ip ##con ##fi ##g and nets ##h and users of unix - like systems may use if ##con ##fi ##g , nets ##tat , route , lan ##sta ##t , f ##sta ##t , and ip ##rou ##te ##2 utilities to accomplish the task . [SEP]
