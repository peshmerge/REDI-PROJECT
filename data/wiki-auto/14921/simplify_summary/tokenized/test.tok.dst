[CLS] an internet protocol address ( ip address ) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the internet protocol for communication . [SEP]
[CLS] an ip address serves two main functions : host or network interface identification and location addressing . [SEP]
[CLS] internet protocol version 4 ( ip ##v ##4 ) defines an ip address as a 32 - bit number . [SEP]
[CLS] however , because of the growth of the internet and the de ##ple ##tion of available ip ##v ##4 addresses , a new version of ip ( ip ##v ##6 ) , using 128 bits for the ip address , was developed in 1995 , and standardized in none } } . [SEP]
[CLS] in none } } , a final definition of the protocol was published . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##6 deployment has been ongoing since the mid - 2000s . [SEP]
[CLS] ip addresses are usually written and displayed in human - read ##able notation ##s , such as " 172 . 16 . 254 . 1 " in ip ##v ##4 , and " 2001 : db ##8 : 0 : 123 ##4 : 0 : 56 ##7 : 8 : 1 " in ip ##v ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] the size of the routing prefix of the address is designated in cid ##r notation by suffix ##ing the address with the number of significant bits , e . g . , " 192 . 168 . 1 . 15 / 24 " , which is equivalent to the historically used sub ##net mask " 255 . 255 . 255 . 0 " . [SEP]
[CLS] the ip address space is managed globally by the internet assigned numbers authority ( ian ##a ) , and by five regional internet regis ##tries ( ri ##rs ) responsible in their designated territories for assignment to end users and local internet regis ##tries , such as internet service providers . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##4 addresses have been distributed by ian ##a to the ri ##rs in blocks of approximately 16 . 8 million addresses each . [SEP]
[CLS] each is ##p or private network administrator assigns an ip address to each device connected to its network . [SEP]
[CLS] such assignments may be on a " static " ( fixed or permanent ) or " dynamic " basis , depending on its software and practices . [SEP]
[CLS] an ip address serves two principal functions . [SEP]
[CLS] it identifies the host , or more specifically its network interface , and it provides the location of the host in the network , and thus the capability of establishing a path to that host . [SEP]
[CLS] its role has been characterized as follows : " a name indicates what we seek . [SEP]
[CLS] an address indicates where it is . [SEP]
[CLS] a route indicates how to get there . " [SEP]
[CLS] the header of each ip packet contains the ip address of the sending host , and that of the destination host . [SEP]
[CLS] two versions of the internet protocol are in common use in the internet today . [SEP]
[CLS] the original version of the internet protocol that was first deployed in 1983 in the ar ##pan ##et , the predecessor of the internet , is internet protocol version 4 ( ip ##v ##4 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the rapid exhaustion of ip ##v ##4 address space available for assignment to internet service providers and end user organizations by the early 1990s , prompted the internet engineering task force ( ie ##tf ) to explore new technologies to expand the addressing capability in the internet . [SEP]
[CLS] the result was a redesign of the internet protocol which became eventually known as internet protocol version 6 ( ip ##v ##6 ) in 1995 . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##6 technology was in various testing stages until the mid - 2000s , when commercial production deployment commenced . [SEP]
[CLS] today , these two versions of the internet protocol are in simultaneous use . [SEP]
[CLS] among other technical changes , each version defines the format of addresses differently . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the historical prevalence of ip ##v ##4 , the generic term " ip address " typically still refers to the addresses defined by ip ##v ##4 . [SEP]
[CLS] the gap in version sequence between ip ##v ##4 and ip ##v ##6 resulted from the assignment of version 5 to the experimental internet stream protocol in 1979 , which however was never referred to as ip ##v ##5 . [SEP]
[CLS] ip networks may be divided into sub ##net ##works in both ip ##v ##4 and ip ##v ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] for this purpose , an ip address is recognized as consisting of two parts : the " network prefix " in the high - order bits and the remaining bits called the " rest field " , " host id ##ent ##ifier " , or " interface id ##ent ##ifier " ( ip ##v ##6 ) , used for host numbering within a network . [SEP]
[CLS] the sub ##net mask or cid ##r notation determines how the ip address is divided into network and host parts . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " sub ##net mask " is only used within ip ##v ##4 . [SEP]
[CLS] both ip versions however use the cid ##r concept and notation . [SEP]
[CLS] in this , the ip address is followed by a slash and the number ( in decimal ) of bits used for the network part , also called the " routing prefix " . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , an ip ##v ##4 address and its sub ##net mask may be " 192 . 0 . 2 . 1 " and " 255 . 255 . 255 . 0 " , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] the cid ##r notation for the same ip address and sub ##net is " 192 . 0 . 2 . 1 / 24 " , because the first 24 bits of the ip address indicate the network and sub ##net . [SEP]
[CLS] an ip ##v ##4 address has a size of 32 bits , which limits the address space to ( 2 ) addresses . [SEP]
[CLS] of this number , some addresses are reserved for special purposes such as private networks ( ~ 18 million addresses ) and multi ##cast addressing ( ~ 270 million addresses ) . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##4 addresses are usually represented in dot - decimal notation , consisting of four decimal numbers , each ranging from 0 to 255 , separated by dots , e . g . , " 172 . 16 . 254 . 1 " . [SEP]
[CLS] each part represents a group of 8 bits ( an oct ##et ) of the address . [SEP]
[CLS] in some cases of technical writing , ip ##v ##4 addresses may be presented in various he ##xa ##de ##ci ##mal , oct ##al , or binary representations . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early stages of development of the internet protocol , the network number was always the highest order oct ##et ( most significant eight bits ) . [SEP]
[CLS] because this method allowed for only 256 networks , it soon proved inadequate as additional networks developed that were independent of the existing networks already designated by a network number . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1981 , the addressing specification was revised with the introduction of class ##ful network architecture . [SEP]
[CLS] class ##ful network design allowed for a larger number of individual network assignments and fine - grain ##ed sub ##net ##work design . [SEP]
[CLS] the first three bits of the most significant oct ##et of an ip address were defined as the " class " of the address . [SEP]
[CLS] three classes ( " a " , " b " , and " c " ) were defined for universal un ##ica ##st addressing . [SEP]
[CLS] depending on the class derived , the network identification was based on oct ##et boundary segments of the entire address . [SEP]
[CLS] each class used successively additional oct ##ets in the network id ##ent ##ifier , thus reducing the possible number of hosts in the higher order classes ( " b " and " c " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the following table gives an overview of this now obsolete system . [SEP]
[CLS] class ##ful network design served its purpose in the startup stage of the internet , but it lacked scala ##bility in the face of the rapid expansion of networking in the 1990s . [SEP]
[CLS] the class system of the address space was replaced with class ##less inter - domain routing ( cid ##r ) in 1993 . [SEP]
[CLS] cid ##r is based on variable - length sub ##net mask ##ing ( v ##ls ##m ) to allow allocation and routing based on arbitrary - length prefix ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] today , remnants of class ##ful network concepts function only in a limited scope as the default configuration parameters of some network software and hardware components ( e . g . net ##mas ##k ) , and in the technical jar ##gon used in network administrators ' discussions . [SEP]
[CLS] early network design , when global end - to - end connectivity was envisioned for communications with all internet hosts , intended that ip addresses be globally unique . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it was found that this was not always necessary as private networks developed and public address space needed to be conserved . [SEP]
[CLS] computers not connected to the internet , such as factory machines that communicate only with each other via tc ##p / ip , need not have globally unique ip addresses . [SEP]
[CLS] today , such private networks are widely used and typically connect to the internet with network address translation ( nat ) , when needed . [SEP]
[CLS] three non - overlapping ranges of ip ##v ##4 addresses for private networks are reserved . [SEP]
[CLS] these addresses are not routed on the internet and thus their use need not be coordinated with an ip address registry . [SEP]
[CLS] any user may use any of the reserved blocks . [SEP]
[CLS] typically , a network administrator will divide a block into sub ##nets ; for example , many home route ##rs automatically use a default address range of " 192 . 168 . 0 . 0 " through " 192 . 168 . 0 . 255 " ( " 192 . 168 . 0 . 0 / 24 " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in ip ##v ##6 , the address size was increased from 32 bits in ip ##v ##4 to 128 bits , thus providing up to 2 ( approximately ) addresses . [SEP]
[CLS] this is deemed sufficient for the fore ##see ##able future . [SEP]
[CLS] the intent of the new design was not to provide just a sufficient quantity of addresses , but also redesign routing in the internet by allowing more efficient aggregation of sub ##net ##work routing prefix ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] this resulted in slower growth of routing tables in route ##rs . [SEP]
[CLS] the smallest possible individual allocation is a sub ##net for 2 hosts , which is the square of the size of the entire ip ##v ##4 internet . [SEP]
[CLS] at these levels , actual address utilization ratios will be small on any ip ##v ##6 network segment . [SEP]
[CLS] the new design also provides the opportunity to separate the addressing infrastructure of a network segment , i . e . the local administration of the segment ' s available space , from the addressing prefix used to route traffic to and from external networks . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##6 has facilities that automatically change the routing prefix of entire networks , should the global connectivity or the routing policy change , without requiring internal redesign or manual ren ##umber ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] the large number of ip ##v ##6 addresses allows large blocks to be assigned for specific purposes and , where appropriate , to be aggregate ##d for efficient routing . [SEP]
[CLS] with a large address space , there is no need to have complex address conservation methods as used in cid ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] all modern desktop and enterprise server operating systems include native support for the ip ##v ##6 protocol , but it is not yet widely deployed in other devices , such as residential networking route ##rs , voice over ip ( vo ##ip ) and multimedia equipment , and some networking hardware . [SEP]
[CLS] just as ip ##v ##4 reserves addresses for private networks , blocks of addresses are set aside in ip ##v ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] in ip ##v ##6 , these are referred to as unique local addresses ( ul ##as ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the routing prefix " fc ##00 : : / 7 " is reserved for this block , which is divided into two " / 8 " blocks with different implied policies . [SEP]
[CLS] the addresses include a 40 - bit pseudo ##rand ##om number that minimize ##s the risk of address collisions if sites merge or packets are mis ##routed . [SEP]
[CLS] early practices used a different block for this purpose ( " fe ##c ##0 : : " ) , dubbed site - local addresses . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the definition of what constituted a " site " remained unclear and the poorly defined addressing policy created am ##bi ##gui ##ties for routing . [SEP]
[CLS] this address type was abandoned and must not be used in new systems . [SEP]
[CLS] addresses starting with " fe ##80 : : " , called link - local addresses , are assigned to interfaces for communication on the attached link . [SEP]
[CLS] the addresses are automatically generated by the operating system for each network interface . [SEP]
[CLS] this provides instant and automatic communication between all ip ##v ##6 host on a link . [SEP]
[CLS] this feature is used in the lower layers of ip ##v ##6 network administration , such as for the neighbor discovery protocol . [SEP]
[CLS] private and link - local address prefix ##es may not be routed on the public internet . [SEP]
[CLS] ip addresses are assigned to a host either dynamic ##ally as they join the network , or persistent ##ly by configuration of the host hardware or software . [SEP]
[CLS] persistent configuration is also known as using a static ip address . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , when a computer ' s ip address is assigned each time it restart ##s , this is known as using a dynamic ip address . [SEP]
[CLS] dynamic ip addresses are assigned by network using dynamic host configuration protocol ( dh ##cp ) . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##cp is the most frequently used technology for assign ##ing addresses . [SEP]
[CLS] it avoids the administrative burden of assign ##ing specific static addresses to each device on a network . [SEP]
[CLS] it also allows devices to share the limited address space on a network if only some of them are online at a particular time . [SEP]
[CLS] typically , dynamic ip configuration is enabled by default in modern desktop operating systems . [SEP]
[CLS] the address assigned with dh ##cp is associated with a " lease " and usually has an ex ##piration period . [SEP]
[CLS] if the lease is not renewed by the host before ex ##pi ##ry , the address may be assigned to another device . [SEP]
[CLS] some dh ##cp implementations attempt to re ##ass ##ign the same ip address to a host ( based on its mac address ) each time it joins the network . [SEP]
[CLS] a network administrator may con ##fi ##gur ##e dh ##cp by all ##ocating specific ip addresses based on mac address . [SEP]
[CLS] dh ##cp is not the only technology used to assign ip addresses dynamic ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] boots ##tra ##p protocol is a similar protocol and predecessor to dh ##cp . [SEP]
[CLS] dial ##up and some broadband networks use dynamic address features of the point - to - point protocol . [SEP]
[CLS] computers and equipment used for the network infrastructure , such as route ##rs and mail servers , are typically configured with static addressing . [SEP]
[CLS] in the absence or failure of static or dynamic address configurations , an operating system may assign a link - local address to a host using state ##less address auto ##con ##fi ##gur ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] a " sticky dynamic ip address " is an informal term used by cable and ds ##l internet access subscribers to describe a dynamic ##ally assigned ip address which seldom changes . [SEP]
[CLS] the addresses are usually assigned with dh ##cp . [SEP]
[CLS] since the mode ##ms are usually powered on for extended periods of time , the address leases are usually set to long periods and simply renewed . [SEP]
[CLS] if a mode ##m is turned off and powered up again before the next ex ##piration of the address lease , it often receives the same ip address . [SEP]
[CLS] address block " 169 . 254 . 0 . 0 / 16 " is defined for the special use in link - local addressing for ip ##v ##4 networks . [SEP]
[CLS] in ip ##v ##6 , every interface , whether using static or dynamic address assignments , also receives a link - local address automatically in the block " fe ##80 : : / 10 " . [SEP]
[CLS] these addresses are only valid on the link , such as a local network segment or point - to - point connection , to which a host is connected . [SEP]
[CLS] these addresses are not ro ##utable and , like private addresses , cannot be the source or destination of packets travers ##ing the internet . [SEP]
[CLS] when the link - local ip ##v ##4 address block was reserved , no standards existed for mechanisms of address auto ##con ##fi ##gur ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] filling the void , microsoft developed a protocol called automatic private ip addressing ( api ##pa ) , whose first public implementation appeared in windows 98 . [SEP]
[CLS] api ##pa has been deployed on millions of machines and became a de facto standard in the industry . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 2005 , the ie ##tf defined a formal standard for it . [SEP]
[CLS] an ip address conflict occurs when two devices on the same local physical or wireless network claim to have the same ip address . [SEP]
[CLS] a second assignment of an address generally stops the ip functionality of one or both of the devices . [SEP]
[CLS] many modern operating systems not ##ify the administrator of ip address conflicts . [SEP]
[CLS] when ip addresses are assigned by multiple people and systems with differing methods , any of them may be at fault . [SEP]
[CLS] if one of the devices involved in the conflict is the default gateway access beyond the lan for all devices on the lan may be impaired . [SEP]
[CLS] ip addresses are classified into several classes of operational characteristics : un ##ica ##st , multi ##cast , any ##cast and broadcast addressing . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common concept of an ip address is in un ##ica ##st addressing , available in both ip ##v ##4 and ip ##v ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] it normally refers to a single send ##er or a single receiver , and can be used for both sending and receiving . [SEP]
[CLS] usually , a un ##ica ##st address is associated with a single device or host , but a device or host may have more than one un ##ica ##st address . [SEP]
[CLS] sending the same data to multiple un ##ica ##st addresses requires the send ##er to send all the data many times over , once for each recipient . [SEP]
[CLS] broadcasting is an addressing technique available in ip ##v ##4 to address data to all possible destinations on a network in one transmission operation as an " all - hosts broadcast " . [SEP]
[CLS] all receivers capture the network packet . [SEP]
[CLS] the address " 255 . 255 . 255 . 255 " is used for network broadcast . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , a more limited directed broadcast uses the all - ones host address with the network prefix . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the destination address used for directed broadcast to devices on the network " 192 . 0 . 2 . 0 / 24 " is " 192 . 0 . 2 . 255 " . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##6 does not implement broadcast addressing , and replaces it with multi ##cast to the specially defined all - nodes multi ##cast address . [SEP]
[CLS] a multi ##cast address is associated with a group of interested receivers . [SEP]
[CLS] in ip ##v ##4 , addresses " 224 . 0 . 0 . 0 " through " 239 . 255 . 255 . 255 " ( the former class d addresses ) are designated as multi ##cast addresses . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##6 uses the address block with the prefix " ff ##00 : : / 8 " for multi ##cast . [SEP]
[CLS] in either case , the send ##er sends a single data ##gram from its un ##ica ##st address to the multi ##cast group address and the inter ##media ##ry route ##rs take care of making copies and sending them to all interested receivers ( those that have joined the corresponding multi ##cast group ) . [SEP]
[CLS] like broadcast and multi ##cast , any ##cast is a one - to - many routing topology . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the data stream is not transmitted to all receivers , just the one which the route ##r decides is logical ##ly closest in the network . [SEP]
[CLS] any ##cast address is an inherent feature of only ip ##v ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] in ip ##v ##4 , any ##cast addressing implementations typically operate using the shortest - path metric of b ##gp routing and do not take into account congestion or other attributes of the path . [SEP]
[CLS] any ##cast methods are useful for global load balancing and are commonly used in distributed d ##ns systems . [SEP]
[CLS] a host may use geo ##lo ##cation software to de ##du ##ce the geo ##lo ##cation of its communicating peer . [SEP]
[CLS] a public ip address , in common par ##lance , is a globally ro ##utable un ##ica ##st ip address , meaning that the address is not an address reserved for use in private networks , such as those reserved by , or the various ip ##v ##6 address formats of local scope or site - local scope , for example for link - local addressing . [SEP]
[CLS] public ip addresses may be used for communication between hosts on the global internet . [SEP]
[CLS] for security and privacy considerations , network administrators often desire to restrict public internet traffic within their private networks . [SEP]
[CLS] the source and destination ip addresses contained in the header ##s of each ip packet are a convenient means to disc ##rim ##inate traffic by ip address blocking or by selective ##ly tailor ##ing responses to external requests to internal servers . [SEP]
[CLS] this is achieved with fire ##wall software running on the network ' s gateway route ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] a database of ip addresses of per ##missible traffic may be maintained in black ##lists or white ##lists . [SEP]
[CLS] multiple client devices can appear to share an ip address , either because they are part of a shared hosting web server environment or because an ip ##v ##4 network address translator ( nat ) or proxy server acts as an inter ##media ##ry agent on behalf of the client , in which case the real originating ip address might be masked from the server receiving a request . [SEP]
[CLS] a common practice is to have a nat mask a large number of devices in a private network . [SEP]
[CLS] only the " outside " interface ( s ) of the nat needs to have an internet - ro ##utable address . [SEP]
[CLS] commonly , the nat device maps tc ##p or ud ##p port numbers on the side of the larger , public network to individual private addresses on the mas ##que ##rade ##d network . [SEP]
[CLS] in residential networks , nat functions are usually implemented in a residential gateway . [SEP]
[CLS] in this scenario , the computers connected to the route ##r have private ip addresses and the route ##r has a public address on its external interface to communicate on the internet . [SEP]
[CLS] the internal computers appear to share one public ip address . [SEP]
[CLS] computer operating systems provide various diagnostic tools to examine network interfaces and address configuration . [SEP]
[CLS] microsoft windows provides the command - line interface tools ip ##con ##fi ##g and nets ##h and users of unix - like systems may use if ##con ##fi ##g , nets ##tat , route , lan ##sta ##t , f ##sta ##t , and ip ##rou ##te ##2 utilities to accomplish the task . [SEP]
