[CLS] although their father james , duke of york , was roman catholic , mary and her sister anne were raised as anglican ##s at the wishes of their uncle , king charles ii . [SEP]
[CLS] james ' s attempts at rule by decree and the birth of his son , james francis edward stuart , led to his deposition in the glorious revolution and the adoption of the english bill of rights . [SEP]
[CLS] she did , however , act alone when william was engaged in military campaigns abroad , proving herself to be a powerful , firm , and effective ruler . [SEP]
[CLS] her death left william as sole ruler until his own death in 1702 , when he was succeeded by mary ' s sister anne . [SEP]
[CLS] mary ' s uncle was king charles ii , who ruled the three kingdoms of england , scotland and ireland ; her maternal grandfather , edward hyde , 1st earl of clare ##ndon , served for a lengthy period as charles ' s chief advisor . [SEP]
[CLS] she was baptised into the anglican faith in the chapel royal at st james ' s , and was named after her ancestor , mary , queen of scots . [SEP]
[CLS] although her mother bore eight children , all except mary and her younger sister anne died very young , and king charles ii had no legitimate children . [SEP]
[CLS] consequently , for most of her childhood , mary was second in line to the throne after her father . [SEP]
[CLS] the duke of york converted to roman catholicism in 166 ##8 or 166 ##9 and the duchess about eight years earlier , but mary and anne were brought up as anglican ##s , pursuant to the command of charles ii . [SEP]
[CLS] they were moved to their own establishment at richmond palace , where they were raised by their govern ##ess lady frances villiers , with only occasional visits to see their parents at st james ' s or their grandfather lord clare ##ndon at t ##wick ##enham . [SEP]
[CLS] from about the age of nine until her marriage , mary wrote passionate letters to an older girl , frances ap ##sley , the daughter of court ##ier sir allen ap ##sley . [SEP]
[CLS] at the age of fifteen , mary became bet ##rot ##hed to her cousin , the protestant st ##adt ##holder of holland , william iii of orange . [SEP]
[CLS] william was the son of the king ' s late sister , mary , princess royal , and thus fourth in the line of succession after james , mary , and anne . [SEP]
[CLS] at first , charles ii opposed the alliance with the dutch ruler — he preferred that mary wed the heir to the french throne , the dauphin louis , thus ally ##ing his realms with catholic france and strengthening the odds of an eventual catholic successor in britain ; but later , under pressure from parliament and with a coalition with the catholic french no longer politically favourable , he approved the proposed union . [SEP]
[CLS] the duke of york agreed to the marriage , after pressure from chief minister lord dan ##by and the king , who incorrectly assumed that it would improve james ' s popularity among protestants . [SEP]
[CLS] mary accompanied her husband on a rough sea crossing back to the netherlands later that month , after a delay of two weeks caused by bad weather . [SEP]
[CLS] rotterdam was inaccessible because of ice , and they were forced to land at the small village of ter he ##ij ##de , and walk through the frost ##y countryside until met by coaches to take them to hui ##s hon ##sel ##aar ##sd ##ij ##k . [SEP]
[CLS] on 14 december , they made a formal entry to the hague in a grand procession . [SEP]
[CLS] within months of the marriage mary was pregnant ; however , on a visit to her husband at the fortified city of bred ##a , she suffered a mis ##carriage , which may have permanently impaired her ability to have children . [SEP]
[CLS] from may 168 ##4 , king charles ' s illegitimate son , james scott , duke of monmouth , lived in the netherlands , where he was fe ##ted by william and mary . [SEP]
[CLS] william , however , did not consider him a viable alternative and correctly assumed that monmouth had insufficient support . [SEP]
[CLS] upon the death of charles ii without legitimate issue in february 1685 , the duke of york became king as james ii in england and ireland and james vii in scotland . [SEP]
[CLS] when charles ' s illegitimate son the duke of monmouth assembled an invasion force at amsterdam , and sailed for britain , william informed james of the duke ' s departure , and ordered english regiments in the low countries to return to britain . [SEP]
[CLS] james had a controversial religious policy ; his attempt to grant freedom of religion to non - anglican ##s by suspend ##ing acts of parliament by royal decree was not well received . [SEP]
[CLS] mary considered such action illegal , and her chaplain expressed this view in a letter to the archbishop of canterbury , william san ##croft , on her behalf . [SEP]
[CLS] in an attempt to damage william , james encouraged his daughter ' s staff to inform her that william was having an affair with elizabeth villiers , the daughter of her childhood govern ##ess frances villiers . [SEP]
[CLS] alarm amongst protestants increased when his wife , mary of mode ##na , gave birth to a son — james francis edward — in june 1688 , for the son would , unlike mary and anne , be raised a roman catholic . [SEP]
[CLS] anne ' s reply , and continued gossip , seemed to confirm mary ' s suspicions that the child was not her natural brother , and that her father was con ##sp ##iring to secure a catholic succession . [SEP]
[CLS] on 30 june , the " immortal seven " secretly requested william — then in the dutch republic with mary — to come to england with an army to de ##pose james . [SEP]
[CLS] william had made known earlier that a military intervention , for which he had been ass ##em ##bling forces , would be conditional on such an invitation . [SEP]
[CLS] at first , william was still reluctant ; possibly he was jealous of his wife ' s position as the heiress to the english crown and feared she would become more powerful than he was . [SEP]
[CLS] according to gilbert burn ##et , however , mary convinced her husband that she did not care for political power , and told him " she would be no more but his wife , and that she would do all that lay in her power to make him king for life " . [SEP]
[CLS] william agreed to invade and issued a declaration which referred to james ' s newborn son as the " pretended prince of wales " . [SEP]
[CLS] william and the dutch army , without mary who stayed behind in the netherlands , finally landed on 5 november 1688 , having been turned back by storms in october . [SEP]
[CLS] mary was upset by the circumstances surrounding the deposition of her father , and was torn between concern for him and duty to her husband , but was convinced that her husband ' s actions , however unpleasant , were necessary to " save the church and state " . [SEP]
[CLS] when mary travelled to england after the new year , she wrote of her " secret joy " at returning to her homeland , " but that was soon checked with the consideration of my father ' s mis ##fort ##unes " . [SEP]
[CLS] james , too , wrote a dia ##tri ##be against her critic ##ising her di ##sl ##oya ##lty , an action which deeply affected the pious mary . [SEP]
[CLS] william wished to reign as a king , rather than function as a mere consort of a queen . [SEP]
[CLS] for her part , mary did not wish to be queen reg ##nant , believing that women should def ##er to their husbands , and " knowing my heart is not made for a kingdom and my inclination leads me to a retired quiet life " . [SEP]
[CLS] on 13 february 1689 , parliament passed the declaration of right , in which it deemed that james , by attempting to flee on 11 december 1688 , had abd ##icated the government of the realm , and that the throne had thereby become vacant . [SEP]
[CLS] parliament offered the crown not to james ' s eldest son , james francis edward ( who would have been the heir apparent under normal circumstances ) , but to william and mary as joint sovereign ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the only precedent for a joint monarchy dated from the sixteenth century : when queen mary i married philip of spain , it was agreed that the latter would take the title of king , but only during his wife ' s lifetime , and restrictions were placed on his power . [SEP]
[CLS] william , however , would be king even after his wife ' s death , and " the sole and full exercise of the regal power would be executed by the said prince of orange in the names of the said prince and princess during their joint lives . " [SEP]
[CLS] the declaration was later extended to exclude not only james and his heirs ( other than anne ) from the throne , but all catholics , since " it hat ##h been found by experience that it is inconsistent with the safety and welfare of this protestant kingdom to be governed by a pa ##pis ##t prince " . [SEP]
[CLS] the bishop of london , henry compton ( one of the " immortal seven " ) , crowned william and mary together at westminster abbey on 11 april 1689 . [SEP]
[CLS] on the same day , the convention of the estates of scotland — which was much more divided than the english parliament — finally declared that james was no longer king of scotland , that " no pa ##pis ##t can be king or queen of this realm " , that william and mary would be joint sovereign ##s , and that william would exercise sole and full power . [SEP]
[CLS] even after the declaration , there was still substantial support for james in scotland . [SEP]
[CLS] the huge losses suffered by dundee ' s troops , however , coupled with his fatal wounding at the start of the battle , served to remove the only effective resistance to william and the uprising was quickly crushed , suffering a res ##ound ##ing defeat the next month at the battle of dun ##kel ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] in december 1689 , parliament passed one of the most important constitutional documents in english history , the bill of rights . [SEP]
[CLS] this measure — which rest ##ated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier declaration of right — established restrictions on the royal pre ##ro ##gative ; it declared , among other things , that the sovereign could not suspend laws passed by parliament , levy taxes without parliamentary consent , in ##fr ##inge the right to petition , raise a standing army during peace ##time without parliamentary consent , deny the right to bear arms to protestant subjects , und ##ul ##y interfere with parliamentary elections , punish members of either house of parliament for anything said during debates , require excessive bail , or in ##flict cruel or unusual punishments . [SEP]
[CLS] following the death of either william iii or mary ii , the other was to continue to reign . [SEP]
[CLS] next in the line of succession would be any children of the couple , to be followed by mary ' s sister anne and her children . [SEP]
[CLS] last in the line of succession stood any children william iii might have had from any subsequent marriage . [SEP]
[CLS] william had crushed the irish jacobite ##s by 1692 , but he continued with campaigns abroad to wage war against france in the netherlands . [SEP]
[CLS] whilst her husband was away , mary administered the government of the realm with the advice of a nine - member cabinet council . [SEP]
[CLS] she was not keen to assume power and felt " deprived of all that was dear to me in the person of my husband , left among those that were perfect strangers to me : my sister of a humour so reserved that i could have little comfort from her . " [SEP]
[CLS] anne had quarrel ##led with william and mary over money , and the relationship between the two sisters had sour ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] when her husband was away , mary acted on her own if his advice was not available ; whilst he was in england , mary completely refrain ##ed from interfering in political matters , as had been agreed in the declaration and bill of rights , and as she preferred . [SEP]
[CLS] however , she proved a firm ruler , ordering the arrest of her own uncle , henry hyde , 2nd earl of clare ##ndon , for plotting to restore james ii to the throne . [SEP]
[CLS] on the death of archbishop of canterbury john till ##ots ##on in december 169 ##4 , mary was keen to appoint bishop of worcester edward still ##ing ##fleet to the vacancy , but william over - ruled her and the post went to bishop of lincoln thomas ten ##ison . [SEP]
[CLS] anne , who was once again pregnant , sent mary a letter saying she would run any risk to see her sister again , but the offer was declined by mary ' s groom of the stole , the countess of derby . [SEP]
[CLS] william , who had grown increasingly to rely on mary , was devastated by her death , and told burn ##et that " from being the ha ##pp ##iest " he was " now going to be the miserable ##st creature on earth " . [SEP]
[CLS] during a cold winter , in which the thames froze , her em ##bal ##med body lay in state in banquet ##ing house , whitehall . [SEP]
[CLS] her funeral service was the first of any royal attended by all the members of both houses of parliament . [SEP]
[CLS] mary endowed the college of william and mary ( in the present day williamsburg , virginia ) in 169 ##3 , supported thomas bray , who founded the society for promoting christian knowledge , and was instrumental in the foundation of the royal hospital for seamen , greenwich , after the anglo - dutch victory at the battle of la hog ##ue . [SEP]
[CLS] she is credited with influencing garden design at het lo ##o and hampton court palaces , and with popular ##ising blue and white porcelain and the keeping of gold ##fish as pets . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early years of their reign , she was often seen as completely under the spell of her husband , but after she had temporarily governed alone during his absence ##s abroad , she was portrayed as capable and confident . [SEP]
[CLS] her modest ##y and di ##ffi ##den ##ce were praised in works such as " a dialogue concerning women " ( 169 ##1 ) by william walsh , which compared her to ci ##nc ##inn ##atus , the roman general who took on a great task when called to do so , but then willingly abandoned power . [SEP]
[CLS] a week before her death , mary went through her papers , weed ##ing out some which were burnt , but her journal survives , as do her letters to william and to frances ap ##sley . [SEP]
[CLS] the jacobite ##s lamb ##ast ##ed her , but the assessment of her character that came down to poster ##ity was largely the vision of mary as a du ##ti ##ful , sub ##missive wife , who assumed power reluctantly , exercised it with considerable ability when necessary , and willingly def ##erre ##d it to her husband . [SEP]
[CLS] from 11 april 1689 — when the estates of scotland recognised them as sovereign ##s — the royal couple used the style " william and mary , by the grace of god , king and queen of england , scotland , france and ireland , defenders of the faith , etc . " . [SEP]
