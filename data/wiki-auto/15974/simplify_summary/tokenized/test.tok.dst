[CLS] johann georg albrecht ##sberg ##er ( 3 february 1736 – 7 march 1809 ) was an austrian composer , organist , and music theorist and one of the teachers of ludwig van beethoven . [SEP]
[CLS] albrecht ##sberg ##er was born at k ##los ##tern ##eu ##burg , near vienna . [SEP]
[CLS] he originally studied music at mel ##k abbey and philosophy at a benedictine seminary in vienna and became one of the most learned and skill ##ful contra ##pu ##nti ##sts of his age . [SEP]
[CLS] albrecht ##sberg ##er ' s earliest classmates included michael haydn and franz joseph au ##mann . [SEP]
[CLS] after being employed as organist at ra ##ab in 1755 and maria ta ##fer ##l in 1757 , he was appointed th ##urne ##rm ##eis ##ter back at mel ##k abbey . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1772 he was appointed organist to the court of vienna , and in 1792 ka ##pel ##lm ##eis ##ter of st . stephen ' s cathedral . [SEP]
[CLS] his fame as a theorist attracted to him in the austrian capital a large number of pupils , some of whom afterwards became eminent musicians . [SEP]
[CLS] among these were johann ne ##po ##mu ##k hum ##mel , ign ##az mo ##sche ##les , josef wei ##gl ( 1766 – 1846 ) , ludwig - wilhelm te ##pper de ferguson ( 1768 ##af ##ter 1824 ) , antonio casimir cartel ##lier ##i , ludwig van beethoven , anton reich ##a and franz x ##aver wolfgang mozart . [SEP]
[CLS] beethoven had arrived in vienna in 1792 to study with joseph haydn but quickly became in ##fur ##iated when his work was not being given attention or corrected . [SEP]
[CLS] haydn recommended his friend albrecht ##sberg ##er , with whom beethoven then studied harmony and counter ##point . [SEP]
[CLS] on completion of his studies , the young student noted , " patience , dil ##igen ##ce , persistence , and sincerity will lead to success , " which reflects upon albrecht ##sberg ##er ' s own composition ##al philosophy . [SEP]
[CLS] when beethoven was finished studying with albrecht ##sberg ##er he decided to get a few more tips and pointer ##s , so to speak , from haydn . [SEP]
[CLS] from there beethoven possibly studied with antonio sal ##ieri , but this is unknown as a fact . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also quite possible that beethoven went off on his own to make a living , and only then returned after he had a stable career . [SEP]
[CLS] albrecht ##sberg ##er died in vienna ; his grave is in st . marx cemetery . [SEP]
[CLS] his published compositions consist of prelude ##s , fu ##gues and sonata ##s for the piano and organ , string quartet ##s , etc . ; but the greater proportion of his works , vocal and instrumental , exists only in manuscript . [SEP]
[CLS] they are in the library of the vienna gesellschaft der musik ##fr ##eu ##nde . [SEP]
[CLS] around 1765 , he wrote at least seven concert ##i for jaw harp and strings ( three survive in the hungarian national library in budapest ) . [SEP]
[CLS] they are pleasant , well written works in the gala ##nt style . [SEP]
[CLS] one of his most notable works is his concerto for alto trombone and orchestra in b ##♭ major . [SEP]
[CLS] as the trombone has few works dating back to the classical period , his concerto is often highlighted by the trombone community . [SEP]
[CLS] he also wrote a concerto for the man ##do ##la , op . 27 , written positively about in the 1914 book " the guitar and mandolin " . [SEP]
[CLS] probably the most valuable service he rendered to music was in his theoretical works . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1790 he published at leipzig a treatise on composition , of which a third edition appeared in 1821 . [SEP]
[CLS] a collection of his writings on harmony , in three volumes , was published under the care of his pupil ign ##az von se ##y ##fr ##ied ( 1776 – 1841 ) in 1826 . [SEP]
[CLS] an english version of this was published by novel ##lo in 1855 . [SEP]
[CLS] his composition ##al style derives from johann joseph fu ##x ' s counter ##point , who was ka ##pel ##lm ##eis ##ter at st stephen ' s cathedral 1713 - 1741 , a position that albrecht ##sberg ##er would hold 52 years later . [SEP]
[CLS] a continuous thread can be traced from his teaching through that of his pupil reich ##a , who went on to become the first professor of counter ##point and fu ##gue at the paris conservatoire from 1818 to his death in 1836 , and who in turn reached a wide audience through both his own teaching and his theoretical writings , which were standard reference at the conservatoire for most of the 19th century and translated into german by c ##zer ##ny .
