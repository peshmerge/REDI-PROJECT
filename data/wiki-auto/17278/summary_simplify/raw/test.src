A kremlin (Russian: , , "castle", or "citadel") is a major fortified central complex found in historic Russian cities.
This word is often used to refer to the most famous, the Moscow Kremlin, or metonymically to the government that is based there.
Some kremlins in Russia are called "detinets", as for example the Novgorod Kremlin.
After the disintegrations of the Kievan Rus, the Russian Empire and the USSR, some fortresses considered Kremlin-type, remained beyond the borders of modern Russia.
The same structure in Ukraine is called dytynets ( , from "dytyna" â€“ child).
The term "kremlin" first appeared in 14th century in Russian territories, where it replaced "dytynets".
Many Russian monasteries have been built in a fortress-like style similar to that of a kremlin.
