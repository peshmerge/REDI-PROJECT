[CLS] deng ##ue fever is a mosquito - borne tropical disease caused by the deng ##ue virus . [SEP]
[CLS] symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection . [SEP]
[CLS] this may include a high fever , headache , vomiting , muscle and joint pains , and a characteristic skin rash . [SEP]
[CLS] recovery generally takes two to seven days . [SEP]
[CLS] in a small proportion of cases , the disease develops into severe deng ##ue , also known as deng ##ue hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever , resulting in bleeding , low levels of blood plate ##lets and blood plasma leak ##age , or into deng ##ue shock syndrome , where dangerously low blood pressure occurs . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue is spread by several species of female mosquito ##es of the " ae ##des " type , principally " a . ae ##gy ##pt ##i " . [SEP]
[CLS] the virus has five types ; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type , but only short - term immunity to the others . [SEP]
[CLS] subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its rna . [SEP]
[CLS] a vaccine for deng ##ue fever has been approved and is commercially available in a number of countries . [SEP]
[CLS] the vaccine , however , is only recommended in those who have been previously infected . [SEP]
[CLS] other methods of prevention include reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites . [SEP]
[CLS] this may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment of acute deng ##ue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intra ##ven ##ously for mild or moderate disease . [SEP]
[CLS] for more severe cases , blood trans ##fusion may be required . [SEP]
[CLS] about half a million people require hospital admission every year . [SEP]
[CLS] para ##ce ##tam ##ol ( ace ##tam ##ino ##ph ##en ) is recommended instead of non ##ster ##oid ##al anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsa ##ids ) for fever reduction and pain relief in deng ##ue due to an increased risk of bleeding from nsa ##id use . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue has become a global problem since the second world war and is common in more than 110 countries , mainly in asia and south america . [SEP]
[CLS] each year between 50 and 52 ##8 million people are infected and approximately 10 , 000 to 20 , 000 die . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest descriptions of an outbreak date from 1779 . [SEP]
[CLS] its viral cause and spread were understood by the early 20th century . [SEP]
[CLS] apart from eliminating the mosquito ##s , work is ongoing for medication targeted directly at the virus . [SEP]
[CLS] it is classified as a neglected tropical disease . [SEP]
[CLS] typically , people infected with deng ##ue virus are as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic ( 80 % ) or have only mild symptoms such as an un ##com ##pl ##icated fever . [SEP]
[CLS] others have more severe illness ( 5 % ) , and in a small proportion it is life - threatening . [SEP]
[CLS] the inc ##uba ##tion period ( time between exposure and onset of symptoms ) ranges from 3 to 14 days , but most often it is 4 to 7 days . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , travelers returning from endemic areas are unlikely to have deng ##ue if fever or other symptoms start more than 14 days after arriving home . [SEP]
[CLS] children often experience symptoms similar to those of the common cold and gas ##tro ##enter ##itis ( vomiting and dia ##rr ##hea ) and have a greater risk of severe complications , though initial symptoms are generally mild but include high fever . [SEP]
[CLS] the characteristic symptoms of deng ##ue are sudden - onset fever , headache ( typically located behind the eyes ) , muscle and joint pains , and a rash . [SEP]
[CLS] the alternative name for deng ##ue , " break ##bone fever " , comes from the associated muscle and joint pains . [SEP]
[CLS] the course of infection is divided into three phases : feb ##ril ##e , critical , and recovery . [SEP]
[CLS] the feb ##ril ##e phase involves high fever , potentially over 40 c , and is associated with generalized pain and a headache ; this usually lasts two to seven days . [SEP]
[CLS] nausea and vomiting may also occur . [SEP]
[CLS] a rash occurs in 50 – 80 % of those with symptoms in the first or second day of symptoms as flushed skin , or later in the course of illness ( days 4 – 7 ) , as a me ##as ##les - like rash . [SEP]
[CLS] a rash described as " islands of white in a sea of red " has also been observed . [SEP]
[CLS] some pete ##chia ##e ( small red spots that do not disappear when the skin is pressed , which are caused by broken cap ##illa ##ries ) can appear at this point , as may some mild bleeding from the mu ##cous membranes of the mouth and nose . [SEP]
[CLS] the fever itself is classical ##ly bi ##pha ##sic or saddle ##back in nature , breaking and then returning for one or two days . [SEP]
[CLS] in some people , the disease proceeds to a critical phase as fever resolve ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period , there is leak ##age of plasma from the blood vessels , typically lasting one to two days . [SEP]
[CLS] this may result in fluid accumulation in the chest and abdominal cavity as well as de ##ple ##tion of fluid from the circulation and decreased blood supply to vital organs . [SEP]
[CLS] there may also be organ dysfunction and severe bleeding , typically from the gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract . [SEP]
[CLS] shock ( deng ##ue shock syndrome ) and hem ##or ##rh ##age ( deng ##ue hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever ) occur in less than 5 % of all cases of deng ##ue ; however , those who have previously been infected with other ser ##otype ##s of deng ##ue virus ( " secondary infection " ) are at an increased risk . [SEP]
[CLS] this critical phase , while rare , occurs relatively more commonly in children and young adults . [SEP]
[CLS] the recovery phase occurs next , with res ##or ##ption of the leaked fluid into the blood ##stream . [SEP]
[CLS] this usually lasts two to three days . [SEP]
[CLS] the improvement is often striking , and can be accompanied with severe it ##ching and a slow heart rate . [SEP]
[CLS] another rash may occur with either a mac ##ulo ##pa ##pu ##lar or a va ##scu ##lit ##ic appearance , which is followed by peeling of the skin . [SEP]
[CLS] during this stage , a fluid over ##load state may occur ; if it affects the brain , it may cause a reduced level of consciousness or seizures . [SEP]
[CLS] a feeling of fatigue may last for weeks in adults . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue can occasionally affect several other body systems , either in isolation or along with the classic deng ##ue symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] a decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0 . 5 – 6 % of severe cases , which is at ##tri ##bu ##table either to inflammation of the brain by the virus or indirectly as a result of impairment of vital organs , for example , the liver . [SEP]
[CLS] other neurological disorders have been reported in the context of deng ##ue , such as transverse my ##eli ##tis and gui ##lla ##in – barre syndrome . [SEP]
[CLS] infection of the heart and acute liver failure are among the rare ##r complications . [SEP]
[CLS] a pregnant woman who develops deng ##ue may be at a higher risk of mis ##carriage as well as low birth weight and premature birth . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue fever virus ( den ##v ) is an rna virus of the family " fl ##avi ##vir ##idae " ; genus " fl ##avi ##virus " . [SEP]
[CLS] other members of the same genus include yellow fever virus , west nile virus , z ##ika virus , st . louis en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is virus , japanese en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is virus , tick - borne en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is virus , ky ##asa ##nu ##r forest disease virus , and om ##sk hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever virus . [SEP]
[CLS] most are transmitted by art ##hr ##op ##ods ( mosquito ##s or tick ##s ) , and are therefore also referred to as ar ##bo ##virus ##es ( " ar " th ##rop ##od - " bo " rn ##e viruses ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the deng ##ue virus genome ( genetic material ) contains about 11 , 000 nu ##cle ##otide bases , which code for the three different types of protein molecules ( c , pr ##m and e ) that form the virus particle and seven other non - structural protein molecules ( ns ##1 , ns ##2 ##a , ns ##2 ##b , ns ##3 , ns ##4 ##a , ns ##4 ##b , ns ##5 ) that are found in infected host cells only and are required for replication of the virus . [SEP]
[CLS] there are five strains of the virus , called ser ##otype ##s , of which the first four are referred to as den ##v - 1 , den ##v - 2 , den ##v - 3 and den ##v - 4 . [SEP]
[CLS] the fifth type was announced in 2013 . [SEP]
[CLS] the distinctions between the ser ##otype ##s are based on their antigen ##ici ##ty . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue virus is primarily transmitted by " ae ##des " mosquito ##s , particularly " a . ae ##gy ##pt ##i " . [SEP]
[CLS] these mosquito ##s usually live between the latitude ##s of 35 ##° north and 35 ##° south below an elevation of 1000 m . [SEP]
[CLS] they typically bite during the early morning and in the evening , but they may bite and thus spread infection at any time of day . [SEP]
[CLS] other " ae ##des " species that transmit the disease include " a . al ##bo ##pic ##tus " , " a . poly ##nes ##iensis " and " a . sc ##ute ##llar ##is " . [SEP]
[CLS] humans are the primary host of the virus , but it also ci ##rc ##ulates in non ##hum ##an primate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] an infection can be acquired via a single bite . [SEP]
[CLS] a female mosquito that takes a blood meal from a person infected with deng ##ue fever , during the initial 2 - to 10 - day feb ##ril ##e period , becomes itself infected with the virus in the cells lining its gut . [SEP]
[CLS] about 8 – 10 days later , the virus spreads to other tissues including the mosquito ' s saliva ##ry glands and is subsequently released into its saliva . [SEP]
[CLS] the virus seems to have no detrimental effect on the mosquito , which remains infected for life . [SEP]
[CLS] " ae ##des ae ##gy ##pt ##i " is particularly involved , as it prefers to lay its eggs in artificial water containers , to live in close proximity to humans , and to feed on people rather than other ve ##rte ##brates . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue can also be transmitted via infected blood products and through organ donation . [SEP]
[CLS] in countries such as singapore , where deng ##ue is endemic , the risk is estimated to be between 1 . 6 and 6 per 10 , 000 trans ##fusion ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] vertical transmission ( from mother to child ) during pregnancy or at birth has been reported . [SEP]
[CLS] other person - to - person modes of transmission have also been reported , but are very unusual . [SEP]
[CLS] the genetic variation in deng ##ue viruses is region specific , suggest ##ive that establishment into new territories is relatively in ##fr ##e ##quent , despite deng ##ue emerging in new regions in recent decades . [SEP]
[CLS] severe disease is more common in babies and young children , and in contrast to many other infections , it is more common in children who are relatively well no ##uri ##shed . [SEP]
[CLS] other risk factors for severe disease include female sex , high body mass index , and viral load . [SEP]
[CLS] while each ser ##otype can cause the full spectrum of disease , virus strain is a risk factor . [SEP]
[CLS] infection with one ser ##otype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type , but only short - term protection against the other three . [SEP]
[CLS] the risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to ser ##otype den ##v - 1 contracts ser ##otype den ##v - 2 or den ##v - 3 , or if someone previously exposed to den ##v - 3 acquire ##s den ##v - 2 . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue can be life - threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma . [SEP]
[CLS] poly ##morphism ##s ( normal variations ) in particular genes have been linked with an increased risk of severe deng ##ue complications . [SEP]
[CLS] examples include the genes coding for the proteins tn ##f ##α , mann ##an - binding le ##ct ##in , ct ##la ##4 , t ##gf ##β , dc - sign , plc ##e ##1 , and particular forms of human le ##uk ##oc ##yte antigen from gene variations of h ##la - b . [SEP]
[CLS] a common genetic abnormal ##ity , especially in africans , known as glucose - 6 - phosphate de ##hy ##dro ##genase deficiency , appears to increase the risk . [SEP]
[CLS] poly ##morphism ##s in the genes for the vitamin d receptor and fc ##γ ##r seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary deng ##ue infection . [SEP]
[CLS] when a mosquito carrying deng ##ue virus bites a person , the virus enters the skin together with the mosquito ' s saliva . [SEP]
[CLS] it binds to and enters white blood cells , and reproduce ##s inside the cells while they move throughout the body . [SEP]
[CLS] the white blood cells respond by producing a number of signaling proteins , such as cy ##tok ##ines and inter ##fer ##ons , which are responsible for many of the symptoms , such as the fever , the flu - like symptoms , and the severe pains . [SEP]
[CLS] in severe infection , the virus production inside the body is greatly increased , and many more organs ( such as the liver and the bone marrow ) can be affected . [SEP]
[CLS] fluid from the blood ##stream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into body ca ##vi ##ties due to cap ##illa ##ry per ##me ##ability . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , less blood ci ##rc ##ulates in the blood vessels , and the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the st ##rom ##al cells leads to reduced numbers of plate ##lets , which are necessary for effective blood cl ##otti ##ng ; this increases the risk of bleeding , the other major com ##plication of deng ##ue fever . [SEP]
[CLS] once inside the skin , deng ##ue virus binds to lange ##rh ##ans cells ( a population of den ##dr ##itic cells in the skin that identifies pathogen ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the lange ##rh ##ans cell , specifically the c - type le ##ct ##ins called dc - sign , mann ##ose receptor and cl ##ec ##5 ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] dc - sign , a non - specific receptor for foreign material on den ##dr ##itic cells , seems to be the main point of entry . [SEP]
[CLS] the den ##dr ##itic cell moves to the nearest l ##ym ##ph node . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , the virus genome is translated in membrane - bound ve ##sic ##les on the cell ' s end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum , where the cell ' s protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral rna and begin to form viral particles . [SEP]
[CLS] immature virus particles are transported to the go ##l ##gi apparatus , the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains ( g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the now mature new viruses are released by ex ##oc ##yt ##osis . [SEP]
[CLS] they are then able to enter other white blood cells , such as mono ##cytes and macro ##pha ##ges . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial reaction of infected cells is to produce inter ##fer ##on , a cy ##tok ##ine that raises a number of defenses against viral infection through the innate immune system by aug ##ment ##ing the production of a large group of proteins mediated by the ja ##k - stat pathway . [SEP]
[CLS] some ser ##otype ##s of deng ##ue virus appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process . [SEP]
[CLS] inter ##fer ##on also activate ##s the adaptive immune system , which leads to the generation of antibodies against the virus as well as t cells that directly attack any cell infected with the virus . [SEP]
[CLS] various antibodies are generated ; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for ph ##ago ##cy ##tosis ( ing ##est ##ion by specialized cells and destruction ) , but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the ph ##ago ##cytes where it is not destroyed but is able to replicate further . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not entirely clear why secondary infection with a different strain of deng ##ue virus places people at risk of deng ##ue hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever and deng ##ue shock syndrome . [SEP]
[CLS] the most widely accepted hypothesis is that of antibody - dependent enhancement ( ad ##e ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the exact mechanism behind ad ##e is unclear . [SEP]
[CLS] it may be caused by poor binding of non - neutral ##izing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ing ##ested the virus for destruction . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a suspicion that ad ##e is not the only mechanism underlying severe deng ##ue - related complications , and various lines of research have implied a role for t cells and soluble factors such as cy ##tok ##ines and the complement system . [SEP]
[CLS] severe disease is marked by the problems of cap ##illa ##ry per ##me ##ability ( an allowance of fluid and protein normally contained within blood to pass ) and disorder ##ed blood cl ##otti ##ng . [SEP]
[CLS] these changes appear associated with a disorder ##ed state of the end ##oth ##elial g ##ly ##co ##cal ##yx , which acts as a molecular filter of blood components . [SEP]
[CLS] leak ##y cap ##illa ##ries ( and the critical phase ) are thought to be caused by an immune system response . [SEP]
[CLS] other processes of interest include infected cells that become nec ##rot ##ic — which affect both coa ##gul ##ation and fi ##bri ##no ##lysis ( the opposing systems of blood cl ##otti ##ng and cl ##ot degradation ) — and low plate ##lets in the blood , also a factor in normal cl ##otti ##ng . [SEP]
[CLS] the diagnosis of deng ##ue is typically made clinical ##ly , on the basis of reported symptoms and physical examination ; this applies especially in endemic areas . [SEP]
[CLS] however , early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections . [SEP]
[CLS] a probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following : nausea and vomiting , rash , generalized pains , low white blood cell count , positive tour ##ni ##quet test , or any warning sign ( see table ) in someone who lives in an endemic area . [SEP]
[CLS] warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe deng ##ue . [SEP]
[CLS] the tour ##ni ##quet test , which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available , involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the dia ##sto ##lic and sy ##sto ##lic pressure for five minutes , followed by the counting of any pete ##chia ##l hem ##or ##rh ##ages ; a higher number makes a diagnosis of deng ##ue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1 inch ( 6 . 25 cm ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the diagnosis should be considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the tr ##op ##ics or sub ##tro ##pic ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it can be difficult to distinguish deng ##ue fever and chi ##ku ##ng ##un ##ya , a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to deng ##ue . [SEP]
[CLS] often , investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms , such as malaria , le ##pt ##os ##pi ##rosis , viral hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever , ty ##ph ##oid fever , men ##ing ##oco ##cca ##l disease , me ##as ##les , and influenza . [SEP]
[CLS] z ##ika fever also has similar symptoms as deng ##ue . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest change detect ##able on laboratory investigations is a low white blood cell count , which may then be followed by low plate ##lets and metabolic acid ##osis . [SEP]
[CLS] a moderately elevated level of amino ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se ( as ##t and alt ) from the liver is commonly associated with low plate ##lets and white blood cells . [SEP]
[CLS] in severe disease , plasma leak ##age results in hem ##oco ##nce ##nt ##ration ( as indicated by a rising hem ##ato ##cr ##it ) and h ##yp ##oa ##lb ##umi ##nem ##ia . [SEP]
[CLS] pl ##eur ##al e ##ff ##usions or as ##cite ##s can be detected by physical examination when large , but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of deng ##ue shock syndrome . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤ 20 mm h ##g along with peripheral vascular collapse . [SEP]
[CLS] peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed cap ##illa ##ry ref ##ill , rapid heart rate , or cold ex ##tre ##mit ##ies . [SEP]
[CLS] while warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease , the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak . [SEP]
[CLS] the world health organization ' s 2009 classification divides deng ##ue fever into two groups : un ##com ##pl ##icated and severe . [SEP]
[CLS] this replaces the 1997 who classification , which needed to be simplified as it had been found to be too restrictive , though the older classification is still widely used including by the world health organization ' s regional office for south - east asia as of 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] severe deng ##ue is defined as that associated with severe bleeding , severe organ dysfunction , or severe plasma leak ##age while all other cases are un ##com ##pl ##icated . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1997 classification divided deng ##ue into und ##iff ##ere ##nti ##ated fever , deng ##ue fever , and deng ##ue hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever was subdivided further into grades i – iv . [SEP]
[CLS] grade i is the presence only of easy br ##uising or a positive tour ##ni ##quet test in someone with fever , grade ii is the presence of spontaneous bleeding into the skin and elsewhere , grade iii is the clinical evidence of shock , and grade iv is shock so severe that blood pressure and pulse cannot be detected . [SEP]
[CLS] grades iii and iv are referred to as " deng ##ue shock syndrome " . [SEP]
[CLS] the diagnosis of deng ##ue fever may be confirmed by micro ##bio ##logical laboratory testing . [SEP]
[CLS] this can be done by virus isolation in cell cultures , nuclei ##c acid detection by pc ##r , viral antigen detection ( such as for ns ##1 ) or specific antibodies ( ser ##ology ) . [SEP]
[CLS] virus isolation and nuclei ##c acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection , but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost . [SEP]
[CLS] detection of ns ##1 during the feb ##ril ##e phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90 % sensitive however is only 60 – 80 % in subsequent infections . [SEP]
[CLS] all tests may be negative in the early stages of the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] pc ##r and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2012 a pc ##r test was introduced that can run on equipment used to dia ##gno ##se influenza ; this is likely to improve access to pc ##r - based diagnosis . [SEP]
[CLS] these laboratory tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute phase of the illness with the exception of ser ##ology . [SEP]
[CLS] tests for deng ##ue virus - specific antibodies , types i ##gg and i ##gm , can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection . [SEP]
[CLS] both i ##gg and i ##gm are produced after 5 – 7 days . [SEP]
[CLS] the highest levels ( ti ##tres ) of i ##gm are detected following a primary infection , but i ##gm is also produced in rein ##fect ##ion . [SEP]
[CLS] i ##gm becomes und ##ete ##ctable 30 – 90 days after a primary infection , but earlier following re - infections . [SEP]
[CLS] i ##gg , by contrast , remains detect ##able for over 60 years and , in the absence of symptoms , is a useful indicator of past infection . [SEP]
[CLS] after a primary infection , i ##gg reaches peak levels in the blood after 14 – 21 days . [SEP]
[CLS] in subsequent re - infections , levels peak earlier and the ti ##tres are usually higher . [SEP]
[CLS] both i ##gg and i ##gm provide protective immunity to the in ##fect ##ing ser ##otype of the virus . [SEP]
[CLS] in testing for i ##gg and i ##gm antibodies there may be cross - react ##ivity with other fl ##avi ##virus ##es which may result in a false positive after recent infections or va ##cci ##nation ##s with yellow fever virus or japanese en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] the detection of i ##gg alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than four ##fold increase in levels of specific i ##gg is detected . [SEP]
[CLS] in a person with symptoms , the detection of i ##gm is considered diagnostic . [SEP]
[CLS] prevention depends on control of and protection from the bites of the mosquito that transmit ##s it . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary method of controlling " a . ae ##gy ##pt ##i " is by eliminating its habitats . [SEP]
[CLS] this is done by getting rid of open sources of water , or if this is not possible , by adding insect ##icides or biological control agents to these areas . [SEP]
[CLS] generalized spraying with organ ##op ##hos ##phate or p ##yre ##th ##roid insect ##icides , while sometimes done , is not thought to be effective . [SEP]
[CLS] reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control , given the concerns of negative health effects from insect ##icides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents . [SEP]
[CLS] people can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin , using mosquito netting while resting , and / or the application of insect rep ##elle ##nt ( dee ##t being the most effective ) . [SEP]
[CLS] while these measures can be an effective means of reducing an individual ' s risk of exposure , they do little in terms of mit ##iga ##ting the frequency of outbreak ##s , which appear to be on the rise in some areas , probably due to urban ##ization increasing the habitat of " a . ae ##gy ##pt ##i " . [SEP]
[CLS] the range of the disease also appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2016 a partially effective vaccine for deng ##ue fever became commercially available in the philippines and indonesia . [SEP]
[CLS] it has also been approved for use by mexico , brazil , el salvador , costa rica , singapore , paraguay , much of europe , and the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] the vaccine is only to be used in people who have previously had a deng ##ue infection as otherwise there was evidence it may worse ##n subsequent infections . [SEP]
[CLS] in indonesia it costs about us $ 207 for the recommended three doses . [SEP]
[CLS] the vaccine is produced by san ##of ##i and goes by the brand name deng ##va ##xia . [SEP]
[CLS] it is based on a weakened combination of the yellow fever virus and each of the four deng ##ue ser ##otype ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] two studies of a vaccine found it was 60 % effective and prevented more than 80 to 90 % of severe cases . [SEP]
[CLS] this is less than wished for by some . [SEP]
[CLS] there are ongoing programs working on a deng ##ue vaccine to cover all four ser ##otype ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] now that there is a fifth ser ##otype this will need to be factor ##ed in . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the concerns is that a vaccine could increase the risk of severe disease through antibody - dependent enhancement ( ad ##e ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the ideal vaccine is safe , effective after one or two injection ##s , covers all ser ##otype ##s , does not contribute to ad ##e , is easily transported and stored , and is both affordable and cost - effective . [SEP]
[CLS] international anti - deng ##ue day is observed every year on 15 june . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea was first agreed upon in 2010 with the first event held in jakarta , indonesia in 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] further events were held in 2012 in yang ##on , myanmar and in 2013 in vietnam . [SEP]
[CLS] goals are to increase public awareness about deng ##ue , mob ##ili ##ze resources for its prevention and control and , to demonstrate the asian region ' s commitment in tack ##ling the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] there are no specific anti ##vira ##l drugs for deng ##ue ; however , maintaining proper fluid balance is important . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment depends on the symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] those who are able to drink , are passing urine , have no " warning signs " and are otherwise healthy can be managed at home with daily follow - up and oral re ##hy ##dra ##tion therapy . [SEP]
[CLS] those who have other health problems , have " warning signs " , or cannot manage regular follow - up should be cared for in hospital . [SEP]
[CLS] in those with severe deng ##ue care should be provided in an area where there is access to an intensive care unit . [SEP]
[CLS] intra ##ven ##ous hydra ##tion , if required , is typically only needed for one or two days . [SEP]
[CLS] in children with shock due to deng ##ue a rapid dose of 20 ml / kg is reasonable . [SEP]
[CLS] the rate of fluid administration is then ti ##tra ##ted to a ur ##ina ##ry output of 0 . 5 – 1 ml / kg / h , stable vital signs and normal ##ization of hem ##ato ##cr ##it . [SEP]
[CLS] the smallest amount of fluid required to achieve this is recommended . [SEP]
[CLS] invasive medical procedures such as nas ##oga ##st ##ric int ##uba ##tion , intra ##mus ##cular injection ##s and arterial pun ##cture ##s are avoided , in view of the bleeding risk . [SEP]
[CLS] para ##ce ##tam ##ol ( ace ##tam ##ino ##ph ##en ) is used for fever and discomfort while nsa ##ids such as ib ##up ##ro ##fen and as ##pi ##rin are avoided as they might ag ##gra ##vate the risk of bleeding . [SEP]
[CLS] blood trans ##fusion is initiated early in people presenting with unstable vital signs in the face of a " decreasing hem ##ato ##cr ##it " , rather than waiting for the hem ##og ##lo ##bin concentration to decrease to some pre ##de ##ter ##mined " trans ##fusion trigger " level . [SEP]
[CLS] packed red blood cells or whole blood are recommended , while plate ##lets and fresh frozen plasma are usually not . [SEP]
[CLS] there is not enough evidence to determine if co ##rti ##cos ##ter ##oids have a positive or negative effect in deng ##ue fever . [SEP]
[CLS] during the recovery phase intra ##ven ##ous fluids are discontinued to prevent a state of fluid over ##load . [SEP]
[CLS] if fluid over ##load occurs and vital signs are stable , stopping further fluid may be all that is needed . [SEP]
[CLS] if a person is outside of the critical phase , a loop di ##ure ##tic such as fur ##ose ##mide may be used to eliminate excess fluid from the circulation . [SEP]
[CLS] most people with deng ##ue recover without any ongoing problems . [SEP]
[CLS] the fatal ##ity rate is 1 – 5 % , and less than 1 % with adequate treatment ; however those who develop significantly low blood pressure may have a fatal ##ity rate of up to 26 % . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue is common in more than 110 countries . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2013 it causes about 60 million sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic infections worldwide , with 18 % admitted to hospital and about 13 , 600 deaths . [SEP]
[CLS] the worldwide cost of deng ##ue case is estimated us $ 9 billion . [SEP]
[CLS] for the decade of the 2000s , 12 countries in southeast asia were estimated to have about 3 million infections and 6 , 000 deaths annually . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2019 the philippines declared a national deng ##ue epidemic due to the deaths reaching 62 ##2 people that year . [SEP]
[CLS] it is reported in at least 22 countries in africa ; but is likely present in all of them with 20 % of the population at risk . [SEP]
[CLS] this makes it one of the most common vector - borne diseases worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] infections are most commonly acquired in the urban environment . [SEP]
[CLS] in recent decades , the expansion of villages , towns and cities in the areas in which it is common , and the increased mobility of people has increased the number of epidemic ##s and circulating viruses . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue fever , which was once confined to southeast asia , has now spread to southern china , countries in the pacific ocean and america , and might pose a threat to europe . [SEP]
[CLS] rates of deng ##ue increased 30 fold between 1960 and 2010 . [SEP]
[CLS] this increase is believed to be due to a combination of urban ##ization , population growth , increased international travel , and global warming . [SEP]
[CLS] the geographical distribution is around the equator . [SEP]
[CLS] of the 2 . 5 billion people living in areas where it is common 70 % are from asia and the pacific . [SEP]
[CLS] an infection with deng ##ue is second only to malaria as a diagnosed cause of fever among travelers returning from the developing world . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the most common viral disease transmitted by art ##hr ##op ##ods , and has a disease burden estimated at 1 , 600 disability - adjusted life years per million population . [SEP]
[CLS] the world health organization counts deng ##ue as one of seventeen neglected tropical diseases . [SEP]
[CLS] like most ar ##bo ##virus ##es , deng ##ue virus is maintained in nature in cycles that involve preferred blood - sucking vectors and ve ##rte ##brate hosts . [SEP]
[CLS] the viruses are maintained in the forests of southeast asia and africa by transmission from female " ae ##des " mosquito ##s — of species other than " a . ae ##gy ##pt ##i " — to their offspring and to lower primate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in towns and cities , the virus is primarily transmitted by the highly domestic ##ated " a . ae ##gy ##pt ##i " . [SEP]
[CLS] in rural settings the virus is transmitted to humans by " a . ae ##gy ##pt ##i " and other species of " ae ##des " such as " a . al ##bo ##pic ##tus " . [SEP]
[CLS] both these species had expanding ranges in the second half of the 20th century . [SEP]
[CLS] in all settings the infected lower primate ##s or humans greatly increase the number of circulating deng ##ue viruses , in a process called amp ##li ##fication . [SEP]
[CLS] one projection estimates that climate change , urban ##ization , and other factors could result in more than 6 billion people at risk of deng ##ue infection by 208 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] the first record of a case of probable deng ##ue fever is in a chinese medical encyclopedia from the jin dynasty ( 265 – 420 ad ) which referred to a " water poison " associated with flying insects . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary vector , " a . ae ##gy ##pt ##i " , spread out of africa in the 15th to 19th centuries due in part to increased globalization secondary to the slave trade . [SEP]
[CLS] there have been descriptions of epidemic ##s in the 17th century , but the most plausible early reports of deng ##ue epidemic ##s are from 1779 and 1780 , when an epidemic swept across asia , africa and north america . [SEP]
[CLS] from that time until 1940 , epidemic ##s were in ##fr ##e ##quent . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1906 , transmission by the " ae ##des " mosquito ##s was confirmed , and in 1907 deng ##ue was the second disease ( after yellow fever ) that was shown to be caused by a virus . [SEP]
[CLS] further investigations by john burton cl ##eland and joseph franklin si ##ler completed the basic understanding of deng ##ue transmission . [SEP]
[CLS] the marked spread of deng ##ue during and after the second world war has been attributed to eco ##logic disruption . [SEP]
[CLS] the same trends also led to the spread of different ser ##otype ##s of the disease to new areas , and to the emergence of deng ##ue hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever . [SEP]
[CLS] this severe form of the disease was first reported in the philippines in 1953 ; by the 1970s , it had become a major cause of child mortality and had emerged in the pacific and the americas . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever and deng ##ue shock syndrome were first noted in central and south america in 1981 , as den ##v - 2 was contracted by people who had previously been infected with den ##v - 1 several years earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] the origins of the spanish word " deng ##ue " are not certain , but it is possibly derived from " ding ##a " in the sw ##ah ##ili phrase " ka - ding ##a pep ##o " , which describes the disease as being caused by an evil spirit . [SEP]
[CLS] slaves in the west indies having contracted deng ##ue were said to have the posture and ga ##it of a dan ##dy , and the disease was known as " dan ##dy fever " . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " break - bone fever " was applied by physician and united states founding father benjamin rush , in a 1789 report of the 1780 epidemic in philadelphia . [SEP]
[CLS] in the report title he uses the more formal term " bi ##lio ##us re ##mit ##ting fever " . [SEP]
[CLS] the term deng ##ue fever came into general use only after 1828 . [SEP]
[CLS] other historical terms include " break ##heart fever " and " la deng ##ue " . [SEP]
[CLS] terms for severe disease include " infectious th ##rom ##bo ##cy ##top ##eni ##c pu ##rp ##ura " and " philippine " , " thai " , or " singapore hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever " . [SEP]
[CLS] outbreak ##s of deng ##ue fever increases the need for blood products while decreasing the number of potential blood donors due to potential infection with the virus . [SEP]
[CLS] someone who has a deng ##ue infection typically is not allowed to donate blood for the next at least six months . [SEP]
[CLS] a national deng ##ue day is held in india on may 16 in an effort to raise awareness in affected countries . [SEP]
[CLS] efforts are ongoing as of 2019 to make it a global event . [SEP]
[CLS] the philippines has an awareness month in june since 1998 . [SEP]
[CLS] research efforts to prevent and treat deng ##ue include various means of vector control , vaccine development , and anti ##vira ##l drugs . [SEP]
[CLS] with regards to vector control , a number of novel methods have been used to reduce mosquito numbers with some success including the placement of the gu ##ppy ( " poe ##ci ##lia re ##tic ##ulata " ) or cope ##pods in standing water to eat the mosquito larvae . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also trials with genetically modified male " a . ae ##gy ##pt ##i " that after release into the wild mate with females , and render their offspring unable to fly . [SEP]
[CLS] attempts are ongoing to in ##fect the mosquito population with bacteria of the genus " wo ##lb ##achi ##a " , which makes the mosquito ##s partially resistant to deng ##ue virus . [SEP]
[CLS] while artificial ##ly induced infection with " wo ##lb ##achi ##a " is effective , it is unclear if naturally acquired infections are protective . [SEP]
[CLS] work is still ongoing as of 2015 to determine the best type of " wo ##lb ##achi ##a " to use . [SEP]
[CLS] apart from attempts to control the spread of the " ae ##des " mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop anti ##vira ##l drugs that would be used to treat attacks of deng ##ue fever and prevent severe complications . [SEP]
[CLS] discovery of the structure of the viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs . [SEP]
[CLS] there are several plausible targets . [SEP]
[CLS] the first approach is inhibition of the viral rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( coded by ns ##5 ) , which copies the viral genetic material , with nu ##cle ##osi ##de analog ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] secondly , it may be possible to develop specific inhibitors of the viral pro ##tea ##se ( coded by ns ##3 ) , which sp ##lices viral proteins . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors , which stop the virus entering cells , or inhibitors of the 5 ′ cap ##ping process , which is required for viral replication . [SEP]
