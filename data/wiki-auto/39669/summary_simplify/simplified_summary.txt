symptoms usually begin three to fourteen days after the person got infected .
if the dengue is bleeding , it can result in bleeding , low levels of blood platelets and plasma leakage , or into dengue shock syndrome .
the virus has several types ; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type , but only short-term immunity to the others .
tests are available to confirm the diagnosis .
a vaccine for dengue fever has been approved and is commercially available in a number of countries .
other methods of prevention include reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites .
treatment of acute dengue is supportive .
paracetamolicative medicine is recommended instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ingredient nsaidsotting for fever reduction and pain relief in dengue due to an increase risk of bleeding from nsaid use .
dengue is common in more than 110 countries .
the disease spread to other countries in the early 20th century .
apart from eliminating the mosquitos , work is still ongoing for medication targeted directly at the virus .
others have more severe illness ; 5 % nigering ; and in a small proportion it is life-threatening .
children often experience very similar to those of the common cold and gastroenteritis vomiting and diarrhearting .
dengue fever is usually behind the eyesight , muscle and joint pains , and a rash .
the name " breakbone fever " comes from the muscle and joint pains .
dengue fever is divided into three stages : febrile , critical , and recovery .
the febrile phase usually lasts between two and seven days .
some petechiaeossaossa produce small red spots that do not disappear when the skin is pressed .
the fever itself is classically biphasic or saddleback in nature , breaking and then returning for one or two days .
there may also be organ dysfunction and severe bleeding .
shock syndrome syndrome syndrome syndrome syndrome syndrome syndrome syndrome syndrome syndrome , hemorrhageerate dengue hemorrhagic fever syndrome , occur in less than 5 % of all cases of dengue fever .
the recovery phase occurs next , with resorption of the leaked fluid into the bloodstream .
it can be accompanied with severe itching and a slow heart rate .
dengue can sometimes affect other systems , either in isolation or with the dengue symptoms .
a decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0.5 – 6 % of severe cases .
other neurological disorders have been reported in the context of dengue , like transverse myelitis and guillain – barre syndrome .
if the heart and acute liver are not treated , the person who got hepatitis c will get the disease will become infected .
the dengue virus genome genome genome genomeicative genetic material contains about 11,000 nucleotide bases , which code for the three different types of protein molecules moleculesminating ns1 , ns2b , ns3 , ns4 , ns4 , ns4 , and ns3 .
these mosquitos usually live between latitudes of 35 ° north and 35 ° south below an elevation of 1000 m .
they bite during the early morning and in the evening , but they may bite and spread infection at any time of day .
a female mosquito that takes a blood meal from a person infected with dengue fever during the first 2-to 10-day febrile period , becomes infected with the virus in the cells lining its gut .
the mosquito seems to have no effect on the mosquito , which remains infected for life .
" aedes aegypti " prefers to lay its eggs in artificial water containers , to live close to humans , and to feed on people rather than other vertebrates .
in countries where dengue is endemic , the risk is between 1.6 and 6 per 10,000 transfusions .
babies and young children can get severe disease .
other risk factors for severe disease are female sex , high body mass index , and viral load .
each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease , but virus strain is a risk factor .
infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type , but only short-term protection against the other three .
dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma .
polymorphisms endings occur in particular genes have been linked with an increase in dengue complications .
polymorphisms in the genes for the vitamin d receptor and fcγr are to offer protection against severe disease in secondary dengue infection .
when a mosquito bites a person , the mosquito will get the dengue virus .
it binds to and enters white blood cells .
the white blood cells react by making a number of proteins , such as cytokines and interferons .
in severe infection , the virus production inside the body is greatly increased .
dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the stromal cells leads to reduced numbers of platelets , which are necessary for effective blood clotting .
once inside the skin , dengue virus binds to langerhans cells .
the virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the langerhans cell .
dc-sign , a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells , seems to be the main point of entry .
the cell 's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral rna and begin to form viral particles .
immature virus particles are transported to the golgi apparatus , where some of the proteins get nutrients nutrients .
they then enter other white blood cells , such as monocytes and macrophages .
the initial reaction of infected cells is to produce interferon , a cytokine that raises a number of defenses against viral infection through the innate immune system by augmenting the production of a large group of proteins mediated by the jak-stat pathway .
some serotypes of dengue virus have mechanisms to slow down this process .
interferon also activates the adaptive immune system .
some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the phagocytes where it is not destroyed .
it is not clear why secondary infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome .
it may be caused by poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have taken over the virus for destruction .
there is a suspicion that ade is not the only mechanism underlying severe dengue-related complications .
leaky capillariesriesriesries fargo and critical phase ɔ are thought to be caused by an immune system response .
a probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following : nausea and vomiting , rash , generalized pains , low white blood cell count , positive tourniquet test , or any warning sign .
warning signs usually happen before the onset of severe dengue .
the tourniquet test is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available .
the diagnosis should be considered in anyone who has a fever within two weeks of being in the tropics or subtropics .
often , investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms , such as malaria , leptospirosis , viral haemorrhagic fever , typhoid fever , meningococcal disease , measles , and influenza .
in severe disease , plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration .
the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may help in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome .
warning signs are an important thing for early detection of potential serious disease .
in 2009 , the world health organization said that dengue fever is too weak and severe .
this replaces the 1997 who classification , which needed to be simplified as it was found to be too restrictive , though the older classification is still widely used .
grade i is the presence of easy bruising or a positive tourniquet test in someone with fever .
however , these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost .
detection of ns1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90 % sensitive however is only 60 – 80 % in subsequent infections .
pcr and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days .
in 2012 a pcr test was introduced .
these tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute phase of the illness with the exception of serology .
the highest levels are detected following a primary infection .
igg , by contrast , remains detectable for over 60 years .
after a primary infection , igg reaches peak levels in the blood after 14 – 21 days .
this may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with yellow fever virus or japanese encephalitis .
the detection of igg alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart .
the mosquito bites it can be treated by removing the mosquito 's control .
this is done by getting rid of open sources of water , or if this is not possible , by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas .
reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control .
people can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothes that fully cover the skin .
these measures can be effective , but they do little in terms of mitigating the frequency of outbreaks .
the range of the disease also appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change .
the vaccine is only to be used in people who have previously had dengue infection .
in indonesia it costs about us $ 207 for the recommended three doses .
it is based on a combination of the yellow fever virus and each of the four dengue serotypes .
now that there is a fifth serotype this will need to be factored in .
the ideal vaccine is safe , effective after one or two injections , covers all serotypes , does not contribute to ade , is easily transported and stored , and is both affordable and cost-effective .
they want to demonstrate the asian region 's commitment in tackling the disease .
there are no specific treatments for dengue fever .
those who are able to drink , are passing urine , have no warning signs .
in people with severe dengue care should be given in an area where there is access to an intensive care unit .
if the person has surgery , it is usually only needed for one or two days .
in children with shock due to dengue a rapid dose of 20 ml / kg is reasonable .
paracetamololicative -lrb- iii -rrb- acetaminophen ƒ is used for fever and discomfort while nsaids such as ibuprofen and aspirin are avoided as they might aggravate the risk of bleeding .
blood transfusion is started early in people having unstable vital signs in the face of a " decreasing hematocrit " , rather than waiting for the hemoglobin concentration to decrease to some predetermined " transfusion trigger " level .
during the recovery phase intravenous fluids are discontinued to prevent fluid overload .
the fatality rate is 1-5 % , and less than 1 % with adequate treatment .
it is one of the most common vector-borne diseases worldwide .
in recent decades , the expansion of villages , towns and cities in the areas where it is common , and the increased mobility of people has increased the number of epidemics and circulating viruses .
dengue fever was once confined to southeast asia .
2.5 billion people live in areas where dengue happens .
dengue is the second most common cause of fever in the world .
it is the most common viral disease transmitted by arthropods .
like most arboviruses , dengue virus is kept in cycles that involve preferred blood-sucking vectors and vertebrate hosts .
the viruses are kept in the forests of southeast asia and africa by transmission from female " aedes " mosquitoes .
in towns and cities , the virus is spread by the highly domesticated " a . aegypti " .
in all settings the infected lower primates or humans greatly increase the number of dengue viruses , in a process called amplification .
one projection estimates that climate change , urbanization , and other factors could result in more than 6 billion people at risk of dengue infection by 2080 .
the first record of probable dengue fever is in a chinese medical encyclopedia from the jin dynasty .
the main vector , " a . aegypti " , spread out of africa in the 15th to 19th centuries .
the most likely early reports of dengue epidemics are from 1779 and 1780 .
in 1907 , dengue was the second diseaseement after yellow fever buys yellow fever .
dengue was caused by the effects of ecologic disruption .
it was first reported in the philippines in 1953 .
dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome were first reported in central america in 1981 .
the word " dengue " is not certain , but it is probably derived from " dinga " in the swahili phrase " ka-dinga pepo " .
in the west indies , slaves in the west indies had dengue posture and gait of a dandy .
the name " breakbone fever " was first used by physician and united states founding father benjamin rush in a 1789 report of the 1780 epidemic in philadelphia .
outbreaks of dengue fever increases the need for blood products while decreasing the number of potential blood donors due to potential infection with the virus .
with regards to vector control , a number of novel methods have been used to reduce mosquito numbers .
there are also trials with genetically modified male " a . aegypti " that after release into the wild mate with females , and render their offspring unable to fly .
this makes the mosquitos not resistant to dengue virus .
there are efforts to develop antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications .
the first approach is to inhibition of the viral rna-dependent rna polymerase coded by ns5 francs , which copies the viral genetic material , with nucleoside analogs .
finally , it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors , which stop the virus entering cells , or inhibitors of the 5 ' capping process , which is required for viral replication .
