[CLS] symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection . [SEP]
[CLS] in a small proportion of cases , the disease develops into severe deng ##ue , also known as deng ##ue hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever , resulting in bleeding , low levels of blood plate ##lets and blood plasma leak ##age , or into deng ##ue shock syndrome , where dangerously low blood pressure occurs . [SEP]
[CLS] the virus has five types ; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type , but only short - term immunity to the others . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its rna . [SEP]
[CLS] a vaccine for deng ##ue fever has been approved and is commercially available in a number of countries . [SEP]
[CLS] other methods of prevention include reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment of acute deng ##ue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intra ##ven ##ously for mild or moderate disease . [SEP]
[CLS] para ##ce ##tam ##ol ( ace ##tam ##ino ##ph ##en ) is recommended instead of non ##ster ##oid ##al anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsa ##ids ) for fever reduction and pain relief in deng ##ue due to an increased risk of bleeding from nsa ##id use . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue has become a global problem since the second world war and is common in more than 110 countries , mainly in asia and south america . [SEP]
[CLS] its viral cause and spread were understood by the early 20th century . [SEP]
[CLS] apart from eliminating the mosquito ##s , work is ongoing for medication targeted directly at the virus . [SEP]
[CLS] others have more severe illness ( 5 % ) , and in a small proportion it is life - threatening . [SEP]
[CLS] children often experience symptoms similar to those of the common cold and gas ##tro ##enter ##itis ( vomiting and dia ##rr ##hea ) and have a greater risk of severe complications , though initial symptoms are generally mild but include high fever . [SEP]
[CLS] the characteristic symptoms of deng ##ue are sudden - onset fever , headache ( typically located behind the eyes ) , muscle and joint pains , and a rash . [SEP]
[CLS] the alternative name for deng ##ue , " break ##bone fever " , comes from the associated muscle and joint pains . [SEP]
[CLS] the course of infection is divided into three phases : feb ##ril ##e , critical , and recovery . [SEP]
[CLS] the feb ##ril ##e phase involves high fever , potentially over 40 c , and is associated with generalized pain and a headache ; this usually lasts two to seven days . [SEP]
[CLS] some pete ##chia ##e ( small red spots that do not disappear when the skin is pressed , which are caused by broken cap ##illa ##ries ) can appear at this point , as may some mild bleeding from the mu ##cous membranes of the mouth and nose . [SEP]
[CLS] the fever itself is classical ##ly bi ##pha ##sic or saddle ##back in nature , breaking and then returning for one or two days . [SEP]
[CLS] there may also be organ dysfunction and severe bleeding , typically from the gas ##tro ##int ##estinal tract . [SEP]
[CLS] shock ( deng ##ue shock syndrome ) and hem ##or ##rh ##age ( deng ##ue hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever ) occur in less than 5 % of all cases of deng ##ue ; however , those who have previously been infected with other ser ##otype ##s of deng ##ue virus ( " secondary infection " ) are at an increased risk . [SEP]
[CLS] the recovery phase occurs next , with res ##or ##ption of the leaked fluid into the blood ##stream . [SEP]
[CLS] the improvement is often striking , and can be accompanied with severe it ##ching and a slow heart rate . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue can occasionally affect several other body systems , either in isolation or along with the classic deng ##ue symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] a decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0 . 5 – 6 % of severe cases , which is at ##tri ##bu ##table either to inflammation of the brain by the virus or indirectly as a result of impairment of vital organs , for example , the liver . [SEP]
[CLS] other neurological disorders have been reported in the context of deng ##ue , such as transverse my ##eli ##tis and gui ##lla ##in – barre syndrome . [SEP]
[CLS] infection of the heart and acute liver failure are among the rare ##r complications . [SEP]
[CLS] the deng ##ue virus genome ( genetic material ) contains about 11 , 000 nu ##cle ##otide bases , which code for the three different types of protein molecules ( c , pr ##m and e ) that form the virus particle and seven other non - structural protein molecules ( ns ##1 , ns ##2 ##a , ns ##2 ##b , ns ##3 , ns ##4 ##a , ns ##4 ##b , ns ##5 ) that are found in infected host cells only and are required for replication of the virus . [SEP]
[CLS] these mosquito ##s usually live between the latitude ##s of 35 ##° north and 35 ##° south below an elevation of 1000 m . [SEP]
[CLS] they typically bite during the early morning and in the evening , but they may bite and thus spread infection at any time of day . [SEP]
[CLS] a female mosquito that takes a blood meal from a person infected with deng ##ue fever , during the initial 2 - to 10 - day feb ##ril ##e period , becomes itself infected with the virus in the cells lining its gut . [SEP]
[CLS] the virus seems to have no detrimental effect on the mosquito , which remains infected for life . [SEP]
[CLS] " ae ##des ae ##gy ##pt ##i " is particularly involved , as it prefers to lay its eggs in artificial water containers , to live in close proximity to humans , and to feed on people rather than other ve ##rte ##brates . [SEP]
[CLS] in countries such as singapore , where deng ##ue is endemic , the risk is estimated to be between 1 . 6 and 6 per 10 , 000 trans ##fusion ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] severe disease is more common in babies and young children , and in contrast to many other infections , it is more common in children who are relatively well no ##uri ##shed . [SEP]
[CLS] other risk factors for severe disease include female sex , high body mass index , and viral load . [SEP]
[CLS] while each ser ##otype can cause the full spectrum of disease , virus strain is a risk factor . [SEP]
[CLS] infection with one ser ##otype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type , but only short - term protection against the other three . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue can be life - threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma . [SEP]
[CLS] poly ##morphism ##s ( normal variations ) in particular genes have been linked with an increased risk of severe deng ##ue complications . [SEP]
[CLS] poly ##morphism ##s in the genes for the vitamin d receptor and fc ##γ ##r seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary deng ##ue infection . [SEP]
[CLS] when a mosquito carrying deng ##ue virus bites a person , the virus enters the skin together with the mosquito ' s saliva . [SEP]
[CLS] it binds to and enters white blood cells , and reproduce ##s inside the cells while they move throughout the body . [SEP]
[CLS] the white blood cells respond by producing a number of signaling proteins , such as cy ##tok ##ines and inter ##fer ##ons , which are responsible for many of the symptoms , such as the fever , the flu - like symptoms , and the severe pains . [SEP]
[CLS] in severe infection , the virus production inside the body is greatly increased , and many more organs ( such as the liver and the bone marrow ) can be affected . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the st ##rom ##al cells leads to reduced numbers of plate ##lets , which are necessary for effective blood cl ##otti ##ng ; this increases the risk of bleeding , the other major com ##plication of deng ##ue fever . [SEP]
[CLS] once inside the skin , deng ##ue virus binds to lange ##rh ##ans cells ( a population of den ##dr ##itic cells in the skin that identifies pathogen ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the lange ##rh ##ans cell , specifically the c - type le ##ct ##ins called dc - sign , mann ##ose receptor and cl ##ec ##5 ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] dc - sign , a non - specific receptor for foreign material on den ##dr ##itic cells , seems to be the main point of entry . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , the virus genome is translated in membrane - bound ve ##sic ##les on the cell ' s end ##op ##las ##mic re ##tic ##ulum , where the cell ' s protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral rna and begin to form viral particles . [SEP]
[CLS] immature virus particles are transported to the go ##l ##gi apparatus , the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains ( g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] they are then able to enter other white blood cells , such as mono ##cytes and macro ##pha ##ges . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial reaction of infected cells is to produce inter ##fer ##on , a cy ##tok ##ine that raises a number of defenses against viral infection through the innate immune system by aug ##ment ##ing the production of a large group of proteins mediated by the ja ##k - stat pathway . [SEP]
[CLS] some ser ##otype ##s of deng ##ue virus appear to have mechanisms to slow down this process . [SEP]
[CLS] inter ##fer ##on also activate ##s the adaptive immune system , which leads to the generation of antibodies against the virus as well as t cells that directly attack any cell infected with the virus . [SEP]
[CLS] various antibodies are generated ; some bind closely to the viral proteins and target them for ph ##ago ##cy ##tosis ( ing ##est ##ion by specialized cells and destruction ) , but some bind the virus less well and appear instead to deliver the virus into a part of the ph ##ago ##cytes where it is not destroyed but is able to replicate further . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not entirely clear why secondary infection with a different strain of deng ##ue virus places people at risk of deng ##ue hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever and deng ##ue shock syndrome . [SEP]
[CLS] it may be caused by poor binding of non - neutral ##izing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ing ##ested the virus for destruction . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a suspicion that ad ##e is not the only mechanism underlying severe deng ##ue - related complications , and various lines of research have implied a role for t cells and soluble factors such as cy ##tok ##ines and the complement system . [SEP]
[CLS] leak ##y cap ##illa ##ries ( and the critical phase ) are thought to be caused by an immune system response . [SEP]
[CLS] a probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following : nausea and vomiting , rash , generalized pains , low white blood cell count , positive tour ##ni ##quet test , or any warning sign ( see table ) in someone who lives in an endemic area . [SEP]
[CLS] warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe deng ##ue . [SEP]
[CLS] the tour ##ni ##quet test , which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available , involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the dia ##sto ##lic and sy ##sto ##lic pressure for five minutes , followed by the counting of any pete ##chia ##l hem ##or ##rh ##ages ; a higher number makes a diagnosis of deng ##ue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1 inch ( 6 . 25 cm ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the diagnosis should be considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the tr ##op ##ics or sub ##tro ##pic ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] often , investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms , such as malaria , le ##pt ##os ##pi ##rosis , viral hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever , ty ##ph ##oid fever , men ##ing ##oco ##cca ##l disease , me ##as ##les , and influenza . [SEP]
[CLS] in severe disease , plasma leak ##age results in hem ##oco ##nce ##nt ##ration ( as indicated by a rising hem ##ato ##cr ##it ) and h ##yp ##oa ##lb ##umi ##nem ##ia . [SEP]
[CLS] pl ##eur ##al e ##ff ##usions or as ##cite ##s can be detected by physical examination when large , but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of deng ##ue shock syndrome . [SEP]
[CLS] while warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease , the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak . [SEP]
[CLS] the world health organization ' s 2009 classification divides deng ##ue fever into two groups : un ##com ##pl ##icated and severe . [SEP]
[CLS] this replaces the 1997 who classification , which needed to be simplified as it had been found to be too restrictive , though the older classification is still widely used including by the world health organization ' s regional office for south - east asia as of 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] grade i is the presence only of easy br ##uising or a positive tour ##ni ##quet test in someone with fever , grade ii is the presence of spontaneous bleeding into the skin and elsewhere , grade iii is the clinical evidence of shock , and grade iv is shock so severe that blood pressure and pulse cannot be detected . [SEP]
[CLS] virus isolation and nuclei ##c acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection , but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost . [SEP]
[CLS] detection of ns ##1 during the feb ##ril ##e phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90 % sensitive however is only 60 – 80 % in subsequent infections . [SEP]
[CLS] pc ##r and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2012 a pc ##r test was introduced that can run on equipment used to dia ##gno ##se influenza ; this is likely to improve access to pc ##r - based diagnosis . [SEP]
[CLS] these laboratory tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute phase of the illness with the exception of ser ##ology . [SEP]
[CLS] the highest levels ( ti ##tres ) of i ##gm are detected following a primary infection , but i ##gm is also produced in rein ##fect ##ion . [SEP]
[CLS] i ##gg , by contrast , remains detect ##able for over 60 years and , in the absence of symptoms , is a useful indicator of past infection . [SEP]
[CLS] after a primary infection , i ##gg reaches peak levels in the blood after 14 – 21 days . [SEP]
[CLS] in testing for i ##gg and i ##gm antibodies there may be cross - react ##ivity with other fl ##avi ##virus ##es which may result in a false positive after recent infections or va ##cci ##nation ##s with yellow fever virus or japanese en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] the detection of i ##gg alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than four ##fold increase in levels of specific i ##gg is detected . [SEP]
[CLS] prevention depends on control of and protection from the bites of the mosquito that transmit ##s it . [SEP]
[CLS] this is done by getting rid of open sources of water , or if this is not possible , by adding insect ##icides or biological control agents to these areas . [SEP]
[CLS] reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control , given the concerns of negative health effects from insect ##icides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents . [SEP]
[CLS] people can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing that fully covers the skin , using mosquito netting while resting , and / or the application of insect rep ##elle ##nt ( dee ##t being the most effective ) . [SEP]
[CLS] while these measures can be an effective means of reducing an individual ' s risk of exposure , they do little in terms of mit ##iga ##ting the frequency of outbreak ##s , which appear to be on the rise in some areas , probably due to urban ##ization increasing the habitat of " a . ae ##gy ##pt ##i " . [SEP]
[CLS] the range of the disease also appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change . [SEP]
[CLS] the vaccine is only to be used in people who have previously had a deng ##ue infection as otherwise there was evidence it may worse ##n subsequent infections . [SEP]
[CLS] in indonesia it costs about us $ 207 for the recommended three doses . [SEP]
[CLS] it is based on a weakened combination of the yellow fever virus and each of the four deng ##ue ser ##otype ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] now that there is a fifth ser ##otype this will need to be factor ##ed in . [SEP]
[CLS] the ideal vaccine is safe , effective after one or two injection ##s , covers all ser ##otype ##s , does not contribute to ad ##e , is easily transported and stored , and is both affordable and cost - effective . [SEP]
[CLS] goals are to increase public awareness about deng ##ue , mob ##ili ##ze resources for its prevention and control and , to demonstrate the asian region ' s commitment in tack ##ling the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] there are no specific anti ##vira ##l drugs for deng ##ue ; however , maintaining proper fluid balance is important . [SEP]
[CLS] those who are able to drink , are passing urine , have no " warning signs " and are otherwise healthy can be managed at home with daily follow - up and oral re ##hy ##dra ##tion therapy . [SEP]
[CLS] in those with severe deng ##ue care should be provided in an area where there is access to an intensive care unit . [SEP]
[CLS] intra ##ven ##ous hydra ##tion , if required , is typically only needed for one or two days . [SEP]
[CLS] in children with shock due to deng ##ue a rapid dose of 20 ml / kg is reasonable . [SEP]
[CLS] para ##ce ##tam ##ol ( ace ##tam ##ino ##ph ##en ) is used for fever and discomfort while nsa ##ids such as ib ##up ##ro ##fen and as ##pi ##rin are avoided as they might ag ##gra ##vate the risk of bleeding . [SEP]
[CLS] blood trans ##fusion is initiated early in people presenting with unstable vital signs in the face of a " decreasing hem ##ato ##cr ##it " , rather than waiting for the hem ##og ##lo ##bin concentration to decrease to some pre ##de ##ter ##mined " trans ##fusion trigger " level . [SEP]
[CLS] during the recovery phase intra ##ven ##ous fluids are discontinued to prevent a state of fluid over ##load . [SEP]
[CLS] the fatal ##ity rate is 1 – 5 % , and less than 1 % with adequate treatment ; however those who develop significantly low blood pressure may have a fatal ##ity rate of up to 26 % . [SEP]
[CLS] this makes it one of the most common vector - borne diseases worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] in recent decades , the expansion of villages , towns and cities in the areas in which it is common , and the increased mobility of people has increased the number of epidemic ##s and circulating viruses . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue fever , which was once confined to southeast asia , has now spread to southern china , countries in the pacific ocean and america , and might pose a threat to europe . [SEP]
[CLS] of the 2 . 5 billion people living in areas where it is common 70 % are from asia and the pacific . [SEP]
[CLS] an infection with deng ##ue is second only to malaria as a diagnosed cause of fever among travelers returning from the developing world . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the most common viral disease transmitted by art ##hr ##op ##ods , and has a disease burden estimated at 1 , 600 disability - adjusted life years per million population . [SEP]
[CLS] like most ar ##bo ##virus ##es , deng ##ue virus is maintained in nature in cycles that involve preferred blood - sucking vectors and ve ##rte ##brate hosts . [SEP]
[CLS] the viruses are maintained in the forests of southeast asia and africa by transmission from female " ae ##des " mosquito ##s — of species other than " a . ae ##gy ##pt ##i " — to their offspring and to lower primate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in towns and cities , the virus is primarily transmitted by the highly domestic ##ated " a . ae ##gy ##pt ##i " . [SEP]
[CLS] in all settings the infected lower primate ##s or humans greatly increase the number of circulating deng ##ue viruses , in a process called amp ##li ##fication . [SEP]
[CLS] one projection estimates that climate change , urban ##ization , and other factors could result in more than 6 billion people at risk of deng ##ue infection by 208 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] the first record of a case of probable deng ##ue fever is in a chinese medical encyclopedia from the jin dynasty ( 265 – 420 ad ) which referred to a " water poison " associated with flying insects . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary vector , " a . ae ##gy ##pt ##i " , spread out of africa in the 15th to 19th centuries due in part to increased globalization secondary to the slave trade . [SEP]
[CLS] there have been descriptions of epidemic ##s in the 17th century , but the most plausible early reports of deng ##ue epidemic ##s are from 1779 and 1780 , when an epidemic swept across asia , africa and north america . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1906 , transmission by the " ae ##des " mosquito ##s was confirmed , and in 1907 deng ##ue was the second disease ( after yellow fever ) that was shown to be caused by a virus . [SEP]
[CLS] the marked spread of deng ##ue during and after the second world war has been attributed to eco ##logic disruption . [SEP]
[CLS] this severe form of the disease was first reported in the philippines in 1953 ; by the 1970s , it had become a major cause of child mortality and had emerged in the pacific and the americas . [SEP]
[CLS] deng ##ue hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c fever and deng ##ue shock syndrome were first noted in central and south america in 1981 , as den ##v - 2 was contracted by people who had previously been infected with den ##v - 1 several years earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] the origins of the spanish word " deng ##ue " are not certain , but it is possibly derived from " ding ##a " in the sw ##ah ##ili phrase " ka - ding ##a pep ##o " , which describes the disease as being caused by an evil spirit . [SEP]
[CLS] slaves in the west indies having contracted deng ##ue were said to have the posture and ga ##it of a dan ##dy , and the disease was known as " dan ##dy fever " . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " break - bone fever " was applied by physician and united states founding father benjamin rush , in a 1789 report of the 1780 epidemic in philadelphia . [SEP]
[CLS] outbreak ##s of deng ##ue fever increases the need for blood products while decreasing the number of potential blood donors due to potential infection with the virus . [SEP]
[CLS] with regards to vector control , a number of novel methods have been used to reduce mosquito numbers with some success including the placement of the gu ##ppy ( " poe ##ci ##lia re ##tic ##ulata " ) or cope ##pods in standing water to eat the mosquito larvae . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also trials with genetically modified male " a . ae ##gy ##pt ##i " that after release into the wild mate with females , and render their offspring unable to fly . [SEP]
[CLS] attempts are ongoing to in ##fect the mosquito population with bacteria of the genus " wo ##lb ##achi ##a " , which makes the mosquito ##s partially resistant to deng ##ue virus . [SEP]
[CLS] apart from attempts to control the spread of the " ae ##des " mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop anti ##vira ##l drugs that would be used to treat attacks of deng ##ue fever and prevent severe complications . [SEP]
[CLS] the first approach is inhibition of the viral rna - dependent rna polymer ##ase ( coded by ns ##5 ) , which copies the viral genetic material , with nu ##cle ##osi ##de analog ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors , which stop the virus entering cells , or inhibitors of the 5 ′ cap ##ping process , which is required for viral replication . [SEP]
