[CLS] in chemistry , the empirical formula of a chemical compound is the simplest positive integer ratio of atoms present in a compound . [SEP]
[CLS] a simple example of this concept is that the empirical formula of sul ##ph ##ur mono ##xide , or so , would simply be so , as is the empirical formula of di ##sul ##ph ##ur dioxide , so . [SEP]
[CLS] this means that sul ##ph ##ur mono ##xide and di ##sul ##ph ##ur dioxide , both compounds of sul ##ph ##ur and oxygen , will have the same empirical formula . [SEP]
[CLS] however , their molecular formulas , which express the number of atoms in each molecule of a chemical compound , may not be the same . [SEP]
[CLS] an empirical formula makes no mention of the arrangement or number of atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] it is standard for many ionic compounds , like calcium chloride ( ca ##cl ) , and for macro ##mo ##le ##cule ##s , such as silicon dioxide ( si ##o ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the molecular formula , on the other hand , shows the number of each type of atom in a molecule . [SEP]
[CLS] the structural formula shows the arrangement of the molecule . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also possible for different types of compounds to have equal empirical formulas . [SEP]
[CLS] samples are analyzed in specific elemental analysis tests to determine what percent of a particular element the sample is composed of . [SEP]
[CLS] a chemical analysis of a sample of methyl ace ##tate provides the following elemental data : 48 . 64 % carbon ( c ) , 8 . 16 % hydrogen ( h ) , and 43 . 20 % oxygen ( o ) . [SEP]
[CLS] for the purposes of determining empirical formulas assume that we have 100 grams of the compound . [SEP]
[CLS] if this is the case , the percentage ##s will be equal to the mass of each element in grams . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the empirical formula of methyl ace ##tate is . [SEP]
[CLS] this formula also happens to be methyl ace ##tate ' s molecular formula . [SEP]
