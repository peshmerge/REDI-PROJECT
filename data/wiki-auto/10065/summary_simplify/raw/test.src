In chemistry, the empirical formula of a chemical compound is the simplest positive integer ratio of atoms present in a compound.
A simple example of this concept is that the empirical formula of sulphur monoxide, or SO, would simply be SO, as is the empirical formula of disulphur dioxide, SO.
However, their molecular formulas, which express the number of atoms in each molecule of a chemical compound, may not be the same.
The molecular formula, on the other hand, shows the number of each type of atom in a molecule.
It is also possible for different types of compounds to have equal empirical formulas.
For the purposes of determining empirical formulas assume that we have 100 grams of the compound.
Thus, the empirical formula of methyl acetate is .
This formula also happens to be methyl acetate's molecular formula.
