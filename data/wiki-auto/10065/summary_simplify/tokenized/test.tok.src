[CLS] in chemistry , the empirical formula of a chemical compound is the simplest positive integer ratio of atoms present in a compound . [SEP]
[CLS] a simple example of this concept is that the empirical formula of sul ##ph ##ur mono ##xide , or so , would simply be so , as is the empirical formula of di ##sul ##ph ##ur dioxide , so . [SEP]
[CLS] however , their molecular formulas , which express the number of atoms in each molecule of a chemical compound , may not be the same . [SEP]
[CLS] the molecular formula , on the other hand , shows the number of each type of atom in a molecule . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also possible for different types of compounds to have equal empirical formulas . [SEP]
[CLS] for the purposes of determining empirical formulas assume that we have 100 grams of the compound . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the empirical formula of methyl ace ##tate is . [SEP]
[CLS] this formula also happens to be methyl ace ##tate ' s molecular formula . [SEP]
