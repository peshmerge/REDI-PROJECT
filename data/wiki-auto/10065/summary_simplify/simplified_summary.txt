the empirical formula of a chemical compound is the simplest positive integer ratio of atoms present in a compound .
a simple example of this idea is that the empirical formula of sulphur monoxide , or so , would simply be so , as is the empirical formula of disulphur dioxide , so .
their molecular formulas , which express the number of atoms in each molecule of a chemical compound , may not be the same .
the molecular formula is a way of showing how many atoms are in a molecule .
it is also possible for different types of compounds to have equal empirical formulas .
for the purposes of finding empirical formulas assume that we have 100 grams of the compound .
the empirical formula of methyl acetate is .
this formula is also methyl acetate 's molecular formula .
