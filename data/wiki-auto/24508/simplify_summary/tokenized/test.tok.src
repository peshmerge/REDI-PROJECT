[CLS] a pencil is an implement for writing or drawing , constructed of a narrow , solid pigment core in a protective cas ##ing that prevents the core from being broken and / or marking the user ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] pencil ##s create marks by physical ab ##ras ##ion , leaving a trail of solid core material that adhere ##s to a sheet of paper or other surface . [SEP]
[CLS] they are distinct from pens , which di ##sp ##ense liquid or gel ink onto the marked surface . [SEP]
[CLS] most pencil cores are made of graph ##ite powder mixed with a clay bind ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] graph ##ite pencil ##s ( traditionally known as ' lead pencil ##s ' ) produce grey or black marks that are easily erased , but otherwise resistant to moisture , most chemicals , ultraviolet radiation and natural aging . [SEP]
[CLS] other types of pencil cores , such as those of charcoal , are mainly used for drawing and sketch ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] coloured pencil ##s are sometimes used by teachers or editors to correct submitted texts , but are typically regarded as art supplies — especially those with wax ##y core bind ##ers that tend to sm ##ear when erase ##rs are applied to them . [SEP]
[CLS] grease pencil ##s have a softer , cr ##ayo ##n - like wax ##y core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common pencil cas ##ing is thin wood , usually he ##xa ##gonal in section but sometimes cylindrical or triangular , permanently bonded to the core . [SEP]
[CLS] cas ##ings may be of other materials , such as plastic or paper . [SEP]
[CLS] to use the pencil , the cas ##ing must be carved or peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point . [SEP]
[CLS] mechanical pencil ##s have more elaborate cas ##ings which are not bonded to the core ; instead , they support separate , mobile pigment cores that can be extended or retracted through the cas ##ing ' s tip as needed . [SEP]
[CLS] these cas ##ings can be re ##loaded with new cores ( usually graph ##ite ) as the previous ones are exhausted . [SEP]
[CLS] " pencil " , from old french " pin ##cel " , from latin a " little tail " ( see " penis " ; " pin ##cel ##lus " is latin from the post - classical period ) originally referred to an artist ' s fine brush of camel hair , also used for writing before modern lead or chalk pencil ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] though the arch ##ety ##pal pencil was an artist ' s brush , the st ##ylus , a thin metal stick used for scratching in papyrus or wax tablets , was used extensively by the romans and for palm - leaf manuscripts . [SEP]
[CLS] as a technique for drawing , the closest predecessor to the pencil was silver ##point until in 156 ##5 ( some sources say as early as 1500 ) , a large deposit of graph ##ite was discovered on the approach to grey knot ##ts from the hamlet of seat ##hwa ##ite in borrow ##dale parish , cumbria , england . [SEP]
[CLS] this particular deposit of graph ##ite was extremely pure and solid , and it could easily be saw ##n into sticks . [SEP]
[CLS] it remains the only large - scale deposit of graph ##ite ever found in this solid form . [SEP]
[CLS] chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead . [SEP]
[CLS] consequently , it was called " plum ##bag ##o " ( latin for " lead ore " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] because the pencil core is still referred to as " lead " , or a " lead " , many people have the mis ##con ##ception that the graph ##ite in the pencil is lead , and the black core of pencil ##s is still referred to as " lead " , even though it never contained the element lead . [SEP]
[CLS] the words for pencil in german ( " b ##lei ##sti ##ft " ) , irish ( " pea ##nn lu ##aid ##he " ) , arabic ( ق ##ل ##م ر ##ص ##ا ##ص " q ##ala ##m ras ##as " ) , and some other languages literally mean " lead pen " . [SEP]
[CLS] the value of graph ##ite would soon be realised to be enormous , mainly because it could be used to line the mo ##uld ##s for cannon ##balls ; the mines were taken over by the crown and were guarded . [SEP]
[CLS] when sufficient stores of graph ##ite had been accumulated , the mines were flooded to prevent theft until more was required . [SEP]
[CLS] the useful ##ness of graph ##ite for pencil ##s was discovered as well , but graph ##ite for pencil ##s had to be smug ##gled . [SEP]
[CLS] the news of the useful ##ness of these early pencil ##s spread far and wide , attracting the attention of artists all over the known world . [SEP]
[CLS] because graph ##ite is soft , it requires some form of en ##case ##ment . [SEP]
[CLS] graph ##ite sticks were initially wrapped in string or sheep ##skin for stability . [SEP]
[CLS] england would enjoy a monopoly on the production of pencil ##s until a method of rec ##ons ##ti ##tu ##ting the graph ##ite powder was found in 1662 in italy . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the distinctive ##ly square english pencil ##s continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graph ##ite into the 1860s . [SEP]
[CLS] the town of ke ##swick , near the original findings of block graph ##ite , still manufactures pencil ##s , the factory also being the location of the cumberland pencil museum . [SEP]
[CLS] the meaning of " graph ##ite writing implement " apparently evolved late in the 16th century . [SEP]
[CLS] around 1560 , an italian couple named simon ##io and l ##yn ##dian ##a bern ##aco ##tti made what are likely the first blue ##print ##s for the modern , wood - en ##cased carp ##ent ##ry pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] their version was a flat , oval , more compact type of pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] their concept involved the hollow ##ing out of a stick of juniper wood . [SEP]
[CLS] shortly thereafter , a superior technique was discovered : two wooden halves were carved , a graph ##ite stick inserted , and the halves then glued together — essentially the same method in use to this day . [SEP]
[CLS] the first attempt to manufacture graph ##ite sticks from powder ##ed graph ##ite was in nuremberg , germany , in 1662 . [SEP]
[CLS] it used a mixture of graph ##ite , sul ##ph ##ur , and anti ##mony . [SEP]
[CLS] english and german pencil ##s were not available to the french during the napoleonic wars ; france , under naval blockade imposed by great britain , was unable to import the pure graph ##ite sticks from the british grey knot ##ts mines – the only known source in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] france was also unable to import the inferior german graph ##ite pencil substitute . [SEP]
[CLS] it took the efforts of an officer in napoleon ' s army to change this . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1795 , nicolas - jacques con ##te discovered a method of mixing powder ##ed graph ##ite with clay and forming the mixture into rods that were then fired in a ki ##ln . [SEP]
[CLS] by varying the ratio of graph ##ite to clay , the hardness of the graph ##ite rod could also be varied . [SEP]
[CLS] this method of manufacture , which had been earlier discovered by the austrian joseph hard ##tm ##uth , the founder of the ko ##h - i - no ##or in 1790 , remains in use . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1802 , the production of graph ##ite leads from graph ##ite and clay was patented by the ko ##h - i - no ##or company in vienna . [SEP]
[CLS] in england , pencil ##s continued to be made from whole saw ##n graph ##ite . [SEP]
[CLS] henry be ##sse ##mer ' s first successful invention ( 1838 ) was a method of com ##pressing graph ##ite powder into solid graph ##ite thus allowing the waste from saw ##ing to be reused . [SEP]
[CLS] american colonists imported pencil ##s from europe until after the american revolution . [SEP]
[CLS] benjamin franklin advertised pencil ##s for sale in his " pennsylvania gazette " in 1729 , and george washington used a three - inch pencil when he surveyed the ohio country in 1762 . [SEP]
[CLS] it is said that william munro ##e , a cabinet ##maker in concord , massachusetts , made the first american wood pencil ##s in 1812 . [SEP]
[CLS] this was not the only pencil - making occurring in concord . [SEP]
[CLS] according to henry pet ##ros ##ki , trans ##cend ##ental ##ist philosopher henry david thor ##eau discovered how to make a good pencil out of inferior graph ##ite using clay as the bind ##er ; this invention was prompted by his father ' s pencil factory in concord , which employed graph ##ite found in new hampshire in 1821 by charles dunbar . [SEP]
[CLS] munro ##e ' s method of making pencil ##s was pains ##taking ##ly slow , and in the neighbouring town of acton , a pencil mill owner named e ##ben ##ezer wood set out to auto ##mate the process at his own pencil mill located at nash ##ob ##a brook . [SEP]
[CLS] he used the first circular saw in pencil production . [SEP]
[CLS] he constructed the first of the he ##xa ##gon - and oct ##ago ##n - shaped wooden cas ##ings . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##ben ##ezer did not patent his invention and shared his techniques with anyone . [SEP]
[CLS] one of those was e ##ber ##hard faber of new york , who became the leader in pencil production . [SEP]
[CLS] joseph dixon , an inventor and entrepreneur involved with the tan ##tius ##ques graph ##ite mine in stu ##rb ##ridge , massachusetts , developed a means to mass - produce pencil ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1870 , the joseph dixon cr ##ucible company was the world ' s largest dealer and consumer of graph ##ite and later became the contemporary dixon ti ##con ##der ##oga pencil and art supplies company . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of the 19th century , over 240 , 000 pencil ##s were used each day in the us . [SEP]
[CLS] the favoured timber for pencil ##s was red cedar as it was aromatic and did not splinter when sharpened . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 20th century supplies of red cedar were d ##wind ##ling so that pencil manufacturers were forced to rec ##y ##cle the wood from cedar fences and barns to maintain supply . [SEP]
[CLS] one effect of this was that " during world war ii rotary pencil sharpe ##ners were outlawed in britain because they wasted so much scarce lead and wood , and pencil ##s had to be sharpened in the more conservative manner – with knives . " [SEP]
[CLS] it was soon discovered that incense cedar , when dyed and perfume ##d to resemble red cedar , was a suitable alternative and most pencil ##s today are made from this timber which is grown in managed forests . [SEP]
[CLS] over 14 billion pencil ##s are manufactured worldwide annually . [SEP]
[CLS] less popular alternatives to cedar include bass ##wood and al ##der . [SEP]
[CLS] in southeast asia the wood je ##lu ##ton ##g may be used to create pencil ##s ( though the use of this rainforest species is controversial ) . [SEP]
[CLS] environmental ##ists prefer the use of pu ##lai – another wood native to the region and used in pencil manufacturing . [SEP]
[CLS] on 30 march 1858 , h ##yme ##n lip ##man received the first patent for attach ##ing an erase ##r to the end of a pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1862 , lip ##man sold his patent to joseph rec ##ken ##dorf ##er for $ 100 , 000 , who went on to sue pencil manufacturer faber - caste ##ll for infringement . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1875 , the supreme court of the us ruled against rec ##ken ##dorf ##er declaring the patent invalid . [SEP]
[CLS] historian henry pet ##ros ##ki notes that while ever more efficient means of mass production of pencil ##s has driven the replacement cost of a pencil down , before this people would continue to use even the stu ##b of a pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] for those who " did not feel comfortable using a stu ##b , pencil extend ##ers were sold . [SEP]
[CLS] these devices function something like a " porte - cr ##ayo ##n " . . . the pencil stu ##b can be inserted into the end of a shaft . . . extend ##ers were especially common among engineers and drafts ##men , whose favorite pencil ##s were priced dear ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of an extend ##er also has the advantage that the pencil does not app ##re ##cia ##bly change its he ##ft as it wears down . " [SEP]
[CLS] artists currently use extend ##ers to maximize the use of their colored pencil ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] a standard , # 2 , he ##xa ##gonal pencil is 19 cm long . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also pencil ##s which use mechanical methods to push lead through a hole at the end . [SEP]
[CLS] these can be divided into two groups : prop ##elling pencil ##s use an internal mechanism to push the lead out from an internal compartment , while clutch pencil ##s merely hold the lead in place ( the lead is extended by releasing it and allowing some external force , usually gravity , to pull it out of the body ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the erase ##rs ( sometimes replaced by a sharpe ##ner on pencil ##s with larger lead sizes ) are also re ##movable ( and thus replace ##able ) , and usually cover a place to store replacement leads . [SEP]
[CLS] mechanical pencil ##s are popular for their longevity and the fact that they may never need sharpe ##ning . [SEP]
[CLS] lead types are based on grade and size ; with standard sizes being 2 . 00 mm , 1 . 40 mm , 1 . 00 mm , 0 . 70 mm , 0 . 50 mm , 0 . 35 mm , 0 . 25 mm , 0 . 18 mm , and 0 . 13 mm ( iso 91 ##75 - 1 ) — the 0 . 90 mm size is available , but is not considered a standard iso size . [SEP]
[CLS] pioneered by taiwanese station ##ery manufacturer ben ##sia pioneer industrial corporation in the early 1970s , the product is also known as ben ##sia pencil ##s , stack ##able pencil ##s or non - sharpe ##ning pencil ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a type of pencil where many short pencil tips are housed in a cartridge - style plastic holder . [SEP]
[CLS] a blunt tip is removed by pulling it from the writing end of the body and re - insert ##ing it into the open - ended bottom of the body , thereby pushing a new tip to the top . [SEP]
[CLS] invented by harold gross ##man for empire pencil company in 1967 and subsequently improved upon by arthur d . little for empire from 1969 through the early 1970s ; the plastic pencil was commercial ##ised by empire as the " ep ##con " pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] these pencil ##s were co - ex ##tr ##uded , ex ##tr ##uding a plastic ##ised graph ##ite mix within a wood - composite core . [SEP]
[CLS] residual graph ##ite from a pencil stick is not poisonous , and graph ##ite is harmless if consumed . [SEP]
[CLS] although lead has not been used for writing since antiquity , lead poisoning from pencil ##s was not uncommon . [SEP]
[CLS] until the middle of the 20th century the paint used for the outer coating could contain high concentrations of lead , and this could be ing ##ested when the pencil was sucked or chewed . [SEP]
[CLS] the lead of the pencil is a mix of finely ground graph ##ite and clay powder ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] before the two substances are mixed , they are separately cleaned of foreign matter and dried in a manner that creates large square cakes . [SEP]
[CLS] once the cakes have fully dried , the graph ##ite and the clay squares are mixed together using water . [SEP]
[CLS] the amount of clay content added to the graph ##ite depends on the intended pencil hardness ( lower proportions of clay makes the core softer ) , and the amount of time spent on grinding the mixture determines the quality of the lead . [SEP]
[CLS] the mixture is then shaped into long spaghetti - like strings , straightened , dried , cut , and then tempered in a ki ##ln . [SEP]
[CLS] the resulting strings are dipped in oil or molten wax , which see ##ps into the tiny holes of the material and allows for the smooth writing ability of the pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] a juniper or incense - cedar plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to fashion a " sl ##at , " and the graph ##ite / clay strings are inserted into the grooves . [SEP]
[CLS] another groove ##d plank is glued on top , and the whole assembly is then cut into individual pencil ##s , which are then var ##nished or painted . [SEP]
[CLS] many pencil ##s feature an erase ##r on the top and so the process is usually still considered incomplete at this point . [SEP]
[CLS] each pencil has a shoulder cut on one end of the pencil to allow for a metal fe ##rr ##ule to be secured onto the wood . [SEP]
[CLS] a rubber plug is then inserted into the fe ##rr ##ule for a functioning erase ##r on the end of the pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] graph ##ite pencil ##s are made of a mixture of clay and graph ##ite and their darkness varies from light grey to black : the more clay the harder the pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a wide range of grades available , mainly for artists who are interested in creating a full range of tones from light grey to black . [SEP]
[CLS] engineers prefer harder pencil ##s which allow for a greater control in the shape of the lead . [SEP]
[CLS] manufacturers distinguish their pencil ##s by grading them , but there is no common standard . [SEP]
[CLS] two pencil ##s of the same grade but different manufacturers will not necessarily make a mark of identical tone nor have the same hardness . [SEP]
[CLS] most manufacturers , and almost all in europe , designate their pencil ##s with the letters " h " ( commonly interpreted as " hardness " ) to " b " ( commonly " blackness " ) , as well as " f " ( usually taken to mean " fine ##ness " , although f pencil ##s are no more fine or more easily sharpened than any other grade . [SEP]
[CLS] also known as " firm " in japan ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the standard writing pencil is graded " h ##b " . [SEP]
[CLS] this designation might have been first used in the early 20th century by brook ##man , an english pencil maker . [SEP]
[CLS] it used " b " for black and " h " for hard ; a pencil ' s grade was described by a sequence or successive hs or bs such as " bb " and " bb ##b " for successively softer leads , and " h ##h " and " h ##hh " for successively harder ones . [SEP]
[CLS] the ko ##h - i - no ##or hard ##tm ##uth pencil manufacturers claim to have first used the h ##b designations , with " h " standing for hard ##tm ##uth , " b " for the company ' s location of bud ##ej ##ovic ##e , and " f " for franz hard ##tm ##uth , who was responsible for technological improvements in pencil manufacture . [SEP]
[CLS] as of 2009 , a set of pencil ##s ranging from a very soft , black - marking pencil to a very hard , light - marking pencil usually ranges from soft ##est to hardest as follows : ko ##h - i - no ##or offers twenty grades from 10 ##h to 8 ##b for its 1500 series ; mitsubishi pencil offers twenty - two grades from 10 ##h to 10 ##b for its hi - un ##i range ; der ##wen ##t produces twenty grades from 9 ##h to 9 ##b for its graphic pencil ##s and st ##ae ##dt ##ler produces 24 from 10 ##h to 12 ##b for its mars lu ##mo ##graph pencil ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] numbers as designation were first used by con ##te and later by john thor ##eau , father of henry david thor ##eau , in the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] although con ##te / thor ##eau ' s equivalence table is widely accepted , not all manufacturers follow it ; for example , faber - caste ##ll uses a different equivalence table in its " grip 2001 " pencil ##s : 1 = 2 ##b , 2 = b , 21 ##⁄ ##2 = h ##b , 3 = h , 4 = 2 ##h . [SEP]
[CLS] graded pencil ##s can be used for a rapid test that provides relative ratings for a series of coated panels but can ' t be used to compare the pencil hardness of different coating ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this test defines a " pencil hardness " of a coating as the grade of the hardest pencil that does not permanently mark the coating when pressed firmly against it at a 45 degree angle . [SEP]
[CLS] for standardized measurements , there are mo ##hs hardness testing pencil ##s on the market . [SEP]
[CLS] the majority of pencil ##s made in the us are painted yellow . [SEP]
[CLS] according to henry pet ##ros ##ki , this tradition began in 1890 when the l . & c . hard ##tm ##uth company of austria - hungary introduced their ko ##h - i - no ##or brand , named after the famous diamond . [SEP]
[CLS] it was intended to be the world ' s best and most expensive pencil , and at a time when most pencil ##s were either painted in dark colours or not at all , the ko ##h - i - no ##or was yellow . [SEP]
[CLS] as well as simply being distinctive , the colour may have been inspired by the austro - hungarian flag ; it was also suggest ##ive of the orient at a time when the best - quality graph ##ite came from siberia . [SEP]
[CLS] other companies then copied the yellow colour so that their pencil ##s would be associated with this high - quality brand , and chose brand names with explicit oriental references , such as mika ##do ( renamed mira ##do ) and mongol . [SEP]
[CLS] not all countries use yellow pencil ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] german and brazilian pencil ##s , for example , are often green , blue or black , based on the trademark colours of faber - caste ##ll , a major german station ##ery company which has plants in those countries . [SEP]
[CLS] in southern european countries , pencil ##s tend to be dark red or black with yellow lines , while in australia , they are red with black bands at one end . [SEP]
[CLS] in india , the most common pencil colour scheme was dark red with black lines , and pencil ##s with a large number of colour schemes are produced by various companies . [SEP]
[CLS] pencil ##s are commonly round , he ##xa ##gonal , or sometimes triangular in section . [SEP]
[CLS] carpenter ##s ' pencil ##s are typically oval or rectangular , so they cannot easily roll away during work . [SEP]
[CLS] the following table lists the prominent manufacturers of wood - case ##d ( including wood - free ) pencil ##s around the world . [SEP]
