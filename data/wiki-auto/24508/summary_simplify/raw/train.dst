A pencil is an implement for writing or drawing, constructed of a narrow, solid pigment core in a protective casing that prevents the core from being broken and/or marking the user's hand.
They are distinct from pens, which dispense liquid or gel ink onto the marked surface.
Graphite pencils (traditionally known as 'lead pencils') produce grey or black marks that are easily erased, but otherwise resistant to moisture, most chemicals, ultraviolet radiation and natural aging.
Other types of pencil cores, such as those of charcoal, are mainly used for drawing and sketching.
Grease pencils have a softer, crayon-like waxy core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain.
The most common pencil casing is thin wood, usually hexagonal in section but sometimes cylindrical or triangular, permanently bonded to the core.
To use the pencil, the casing must be carved or peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point.
Mechanical pencils have more elaborate casings which are not bonded to the core; instead, they support separate, mobile pigment cores that can be extended or retracted through the casing's tip as needed.
Though the archetypal pencil was an artist's brush, the stylus, a thin metal stick used for scratching in papyrus or wax tablets, was used extensively by the Romans and for palm-leaf manuscripts.
As a technique for drawing, the closest predecessor to the pencil was silverpoint until in 1565 (some sources say as early as 1500), a large deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, England.
This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks.
It remains the only large-scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form.
Because the pencil core is still referred to as "lead", or a "lead", many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead, and the black core of pencils is still referred to as "lead", even though it never contained the element lead.
The value of graphite would soon be realised to be enormous, mainly because it could be used to line the moulds for cannonballs; the mines were taken over by the Crown and were guarded.
The usefulness of graphite for pencils was discovered as well, but graphite for pencils had to be smuggled.
The news of the usefulness of these early pencils spread far and wide, attracting the attention of artists all over the known world.
However, the distinctively square English pencils continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graphite into the 1860s.
The town of Keswick, near the original findings of block graphite, still manufactures pencils, the factory also being the location of the Cumberland Pencil Museum.
Around 1560, an Italian couple named Simonio and Lyndiana Bernacotti made what are likely the first blueprints for the modern, wood-encased carpentry pencil.
English and German pencils were not available to the French during the Napoleonic Wars; France, under naval blockade imposed by Great Britain, was unable to import the pure graphite sticks from the British Grey Knotts mines – the only known source in the world.
France was also unable to import the inferior German graphite pencil substitute.
In 1795, Nicolas-Jacques Conté discovered a method of mixing powdered graphite with clay and forming the mixture into rods that were then fired in a kiln.
In 1802, the production of graphite leads from graphite and clay was patented by the Koh-I-Noor company in Vienna.
Henry Bessemer's first successful invention (1838) was a method of compressing graphite powder into solid graphite thus allowing the waste from sawing to be reused.
According to Henry Petroski, transcendentalist philosopher Henry David Thoreau discovered how to make a good pencil out of inferior graphite using clay as the binder; this invention was prompted by his father's pencil factory in Concord, which employed graphite found in New Hampshire in 1821 by Charles Dunbar.
Munroe's method of making pencils was painstakingly slow, and in the neighbouring town of Acton, a pencil mill owner named Ebenezer Wood set out to automate the process at his own pencil mill located at Nashoba Brook.
One of those was Eberhard Faber of New York, who became the leader in pencil production.
By 1870, The Joseph Dixon Crucible Company was the world's largest dealer and consumer of graphite and later became the contemporary Dixon Ticonderoga pencil and art supplies company.
The favoured timber for pencils was Red Cedar as it was aromatic and did not splinter when sharpened.
In the early 20th century supplies of Red Cedar were dwindling so that pencil manufacturers were forced to recycle the wood from cedar fences and barns to maintain supply.
One effect of this was that "during World War II rotary pencil sharpeners were outlawed in Britain because they wasted so much scarce lead and wood, and pencils had to be sharpened in the more conservative manner – with knives."
It was soon discovered that Incense cedar, when dyed and perfumed to resemble Red Cedar, was a suitable alternative and most pencils today are made from this timber which is grown in managed forests.
In Southeast Asia the wood Jelutong may be used to create pencils (though the use of this rainforest species is controversial).
Environmentalists prefer the use of Pulai – another wood native to the region and used in pencil manufacturing.
On 30 March 1858, Hymen Lipman received the first patent for attaching an eraser to the end of a pencil.
In 1875, the Supreme Court of the US ruled against Reckendorfer declaring the patent invalid.
Historian Henry Petroski notes that while ever more efficient means of mass production of pencils has driven the replacement cost of a pencil down, before this people would continue to use even the stub of a pencil.
For those who "did not feel comfortable using a stub, pencil extenders were sold.
The use of an extender also has the advantage that the pencil does not appreciably change its heft as it wears down."
These can be divided into two groups: propelling pencils use an internal mechanism to push the lead out from an internal compartment, while clutch pencils merely hold the lead in place (the lead is extended by releasing it and allowing some external force, usually gravity, to pull it out of the body).
Mechanical pencils are popular for their longevity and the fact that they may never need sharpening.
It is a type of pencil where many short pencil tips are housed in a cartridge-style plastic holder.
Invented by Harold Grossman for Empire Pencil Company in 1967 and subsequently improved upon by Arthur D. Little for Empire from 1969 through the early 1970s; the plastic pencil was commercialised by Empire as the "EPCON" Pencil.
Residual graphite from a pencil stick is not poisonous, and graphite is harmless if consumed.
Until the middle of the 20th century the paint used for the outer coating could contain high concentrations of lead, and this could be ingested when the pencil was sucked or chewed.
The lead of the pencil is a mix of finely ground graphite and clay powders.
The amount of clay content added to the graphite depends on the intended pencil hardness (lower proportions of clay makes the core softer), and the amount of time spent on grinding the mixture determines the quality of the lead.
The resulting strings are dipped in oil or molten wax, which seeps into the tiny holes of the material and allows for the smooth writing ability of the pencil.
A juniper or incense-cedar plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to fashion a "slat," and the graphite/clay strings are inserted into the grooves.
Another grooved plank is glued on top, and the whole assembly is then cut into individual pencils, which are then varnished or painted.
Many pencils feature an eraser on the top and so the process is usually still considered incomplete at this point.
Each pencil has a shoulder cut on one end of the pencil to allow for a metal ferrule to be secured onto the wood.
A rubber plug is then inserted into the ferrule for a functioning eraser on the end of the pencil.
Graphite pencils are made of a mixture of clay and graphite and their darkness varies from light grey to black: the more clay the harder the pencil.
Two pencils of the same grade but different manufacturers will not necessarily make a mark of identical tone nor have the same hardness.
Most manufacturers, and almost all in Europe, designate their pencils with the letters "H" (commonly interpreted as "hardness") to "B" (commonly "blackness"), as well as "F" (usually taken to mean "fineness", although F pencils are no more fine or more easily sharpened than any other grade.
This designation might have been first used in the early 20th century by Brookman, an English pencil maker.
Graded pencils can be used for a rapid test that provides relative ratings for a series of coated panels but can't be used to compare the pencil hardness of different coatings.
This test defines a "pencil hardness" of a coating as the grade of the hardest pencil that does not permanently mark the coating when pressed firmly against it at a 45 degree angle.
The majority of pencils made in the US are painted yellow.
It was intended to be the world's best and most expensive pencil, and at a time when most pencils were either painted in dark colours or not at all, the Koh-I-Noor was yellow.
As well as simply being distinctive, the colour may have been inspired by the Austro-Hungarian flag; it was also suggestive of the Orient at a time when the best-quality graphite came from Siberia.
Other companies then copied the yellow colour so that their pencils would be associated with this high-quality brand, and chose brand names with explicit Oriental references, such as Mikado (renamed Mirado) and Mongol.
German and Brazilian pencils, for example, are often green, blue or black, based on the trademark colours of Faber-Castell, a major German stationery company which has plants in those countries.
In southern European countries, pencils tend to be dark red or black with yellow lines, while in Australia, they are red with black bands at one end.
In India, the most common pencil colour scheme was dark red with black lines, and pencils with a large number of colour schemes are produced by various companies.
