[CLS] a pencil is an implement for writing or drawing , constructed of a narrow , solid pigment core in a protective cas ##ing that prevents the core from being broken and / or marking the user ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] they are distinct from pens , which di ##sp ##ense liquid or gel ink onto the marked surface . [SEP]
[CLS] graph ##ite pencil ##s ( traditionally known as ' lead pencil ##s ' ) produce grey or black marks that are easily erased , but otherwise resistant to moisture , most chemicals , ultraviolet radiation and natural aging . [SEP]
[CLS] other types of pencil cores , such as those of charcoal , are mainly used for drawing and sketch ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] grease pencil ##s have a softer , cr ##ayo ##n - like wax ##y core that can leave marks on smooth surfaces such as glass or porcelain . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common pencil cas ##ing is thin wood , usually he ##xa ##gonal in section but sometimes cylindrical or triangular , permanently bonded to the core . [SEP]
[CLS] to use the pencil , the cas ##ing must be carved or peeled off to expose the working end of the core as a sharp point . [SEP]
[CLS] mechanical pencil ##s have more elaborate cas ##ings which are not bonded to the core ; instead , they support separate , mobile pigment cores that can be extended or retracted through the cas ##ing ' s tip as needed . [SEP]
[CLS] though the arch ##ety ##pal pencil was an artist ' s brush , the st ##ylus , a thin metal stick used for scratching in papyrus or wax tablets , was used extensively by the romans and for palm - leaf manuscripts . [SEP]
[CLS] as a technique for drawing , the closest predecessor to the pencil was silver ##point until in 156 ##5 ( some sources say as early as 1500 ) , a large deposit of graph ##ite was discovered on the approach to grey knot ##ts from the hamlet of seat ##hwa ##ite in borrow ##dale parish , cumbria , england . [SEP]
[CLS] this particular deposit of graph ##ite was extremely pure and solid , and it could easily be saw ##n into sticks . [SEP]
[CLS] it remains the only large - scale deposit of graph ##ite ever found in this solid form . [SEP]
[CLS] because the pencil core is still referred to as " lead " , or a " lead " , many people have the mis ##con ##ception that the graph ##ite in the pencil is lead , and the black core of pencil ##s is still referred to as " lead " , even though it never contained the element lead . [SEP]
[CLS] the value of graph ##ite would soon be realised to be enormous , mainly because it could be used to line the mo ##uld ##s for cannon ##balls ; the mines were taken over by the crown and were guarded . [SEP]
[CLS] the useful ##ness of graph ##ite for pencil ##s was discovered as well , but graph ##ite for pencil ##s had to be smug ##gled . [SEP]
[CLS] the news of the useful ##ness of these early pencil ##s spread far and wide , attracting the attention of artists all over the known world . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the distinctive ##ly square english pencil ##s continued to be made with sticks cut from natural graph ##ite into the 1860s . [SEP]
[CLS] the town of ke ##swick , near the original findings of block graph ##ite , still manufactures pencil ##s , the factory also being the location of the cumberland pencil museum . [SEP]
[CLS] around 1560 , an italian couple named simon ##io and l ##yn ##dian ##a bern ##aco ##tti made what are likely the first blue ##print ##s for the modern , wood - en ##cased carp ##ent ##ry pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] english and german pencil ##s were not available to the french during the napoleonic wars ; france , under naval blockade imposed by great britain , was unable to import the pure graph ##ite sticks from the british grey knot ##ts mines – the only known source in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] france was also unable to import the inferior german graph ##ite pencil substitute . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1795 , nicolas - jacques con ##te discovered a method of mixing powder ##ed graph ##ite with clay and forming the mixture into rods that were then fired in a ki ##ln . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1802 , the production of graph ##ite leads from graph ##ite and clay was patented by the ko ##h - i - no ##or company in vienna . [SEP]
[CLS] henry be ##sse ##mer ' s first successful invention ( 1838 ) was a method of com ##pressing graph ##ite powder into solid graph ##ite thus allowing the waste from saw ##ing to be reused . [SEP]
[CLS] according to henry pet ##ros ##ki , trans ##cend ##ental ##ist philosopher henry david thor ##eau discovered how to make a good pencil out of inferior graph ##ite using clay as the bind ##er ; this invention was prompted by his father ' s pencil factory in concord , which employed graph ##ite found in new hampshire in 1821 by charles dunbar . [SEP]
[CLS] munro ##e ' s method of making pencil ##s was pains ##taking ##ly slow , and in the neighbouring town of acton , a pencil mill owner named e ##ben ##ezer wood set out to auto ##mate the process at his own pencil mill located at nash ##ob ##a brook . [SEP]
[CLS] one of those was e ##ber ##hard faber of new york , who became the leader in pencil production . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1870 , the joseph dixon cr ##ucible company was the world ' s largest dealer and consumer of graph ##ite and later became the contemporary dixon ti ##con ##der ##oga pencil and art supplies company . [SEP]
[CLS] the favoured timber for pencil ##s was red cedar as it was aromatic and did not splinter when sharpened . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 20th century supplies of red cedar were d ##wind ##ling so that pencil manufacturers were forced to rec ##y ##cle the wood from cedar fences and barns to maintain supply . [SEP]
[CLS] one effect of this was that " during world war ii rotary pencil sharpe ##ners were outlawed in britain because they wasted so much scarce lead and wood , and pencil ##s had to be sharpened in the more conservative manner – with knives . " [SEP]
[CLS] it was soon discovered that incense cedar , when dyed and perfume ##d to resemble red cedar , was a suitable alternative and most pencil ##s today are made from this timber which is grown in managed forests . [SEP]
[CLS] in southeast asia the wood je ##lu ##ton ##g may be used to create pencil ##s ( though the use of this rainforest species is controversial ) . [SEP]
[CLS] environmental ##ists prefer the use of pu ##lai – another wood native to the region and used in pencil manufacturing . [SEP]
[CLS] on 30 march 1858 , h ##yme ##n lip ##man received the first patent for attach ##ing an erase ##r to the end of a pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1875 , the supreme court of the us ruled against rec ##ken ##dorf ##er declaring the patent invalid . [SEP]
[CLS] historian henry pet ##ros ##ki notes that while ever more efficient means of mass production of pencil ##s has driven the replacement cost of a pencil down , before this people would continue to use even the stu ##b of a pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] for those who " did not feel comfortable using a stu ##b , pencil extend ##ers were sold . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of an extend ##er also has the advantage that the pencil does not app ##re ##cia ##bly change its he ##ft as it wears down . " [SEP]
[CLS] these can be divided into two groups : prop ##elling pencil ##s use an internal mechanism to push the lead out from an internal compartment , while clutch pencil ##s merely hold the lead in place ( the lead is extended by releasing it and allowing some external force , usually gravity , to pull it out of the body ) . [SEP]
[CLS] mechanical pencil ##s are popular for their longevity and the fact that they may never need sharpe ##ning . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a type of pencil where many short pencil tips are housed in a cartridge - style plastic holder . [SEP]
[CLS] invented by harold gross ##man for empire pencil company in 1967 and subsequently improved upon by arthur d . little for empire from 1969 through the early 1970s ; the plastic pencil was commercial ##ised by empire as the " ep ##con " pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] residual graph ##ite from a pencil stick is not poisonous , and graph ##ite is harmless if consumed . [SEP]
[CLS] until the middle of the 20th century the paint used for the outer coating could contain high concentrations of lead , and this could be ing ##ested when the pencil was sucked or chewed . [SEP]
[CLS] the lead of the pencil is a mix of finely ground graph ##ite and clay powder ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the amount of clay content added to the graph ##ite depends on the intended pencil hardness ( lower proportions of clay makes the core softer ) , and the amount of time spent on grinding the mixture determines the quality of the lead . [SEP]
[CLS] the resulting strings are dipped in oil or molten wax , which see ##ps into the tiny holes of the material and allows for the smooth writing ability of the pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] a juniper or incense - cedar plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to fashion a " sl ##at , " and the graph ##ite / clay strings are inserted into the grooves . [SEP]
[CLS] another groove ##d plank is glued on top , and the whole assembly is then cut into individual pencil ##s , which are then var ##nished or painted . [SEP]
[CLS] many pencil ##s feature an erase ##r on the top and so the process is usually still considered incomplete at this point . [SEP]
[CLS] each pencil has a shoulder cut on one end of the pencil to allow for a metal fe ##rr ##ule to be secured onto the wood . [SEP]
[CLS] a rubber plug is then inserted into the fe ##rr ##ule for a functioning erase ##r on the end of the pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] graph ##ite pencil ##s are made of a mixture of clay and graph ##ite and their darkness varies from light grey to black : the more clay the harder the pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] two pencil ##s of the same grade but different manufacturers will not necessarily make a mark of identical tone nor have the same hardness . [SEP]
[CLS] most manufacturers , and almost all in europe , designate their pencil ##s with the letters " h " ( commonly interpreted as " hardness " ) to " b " ( commonly " blackness " ) , as well as " f " ( usually taken to mean " fine ##ness " , although f pencil ##s are no more fine or more easily sharpened than any other grade . [SEP]
[CLS] this designation might have been first used in the early 20th century by brook ##man , an english pencil maker . [SEP]
[CLS] graded pencil ##s can be used for a rapid test that provides relative ratings for a series of coated panels but can ' t be used to compare the pencil hardness of different coating ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this test defines a " pencil hardness " of a coating as the grade of the hardest pencil that does not permanently mark the coating when pressed firmly against it at a 45 degree angle . [SEP]
[CLS] the majority of pencil ##s made in the us are painted yellow . [SEP]
[CLS] it was intended to be the world ' s best and most expensive pencil , and at a time when most pencil ##s were either painted in dark colours or not at all , the ko ##h - i - no ##or was yellow . [SEP]
[CLS] as well as simply being distinctive , the colour may have been inspired by the austro - hungarian flag ; it was also suggest ##ive of the orient at a time when the best - quality graph ##ite came from siberia . [SEP]
[CLS] other companies then copied the yellow colour so that their pencil ##s would be associated with this high - quality brand , and chose brand names with explicit oriental references , such as mika ##do ( renamed mira ##do ) and mongol . [SEP]
[CLS] german and brazilian pencil ##s , for example , are often green , blue or black , based on the trademark colours of faber - caste ##ll , a major german station ##ery company which has plants in those countries . [SEP]
[CLS] in southern european countries , pencil ##s tend to be dark red or black with yellow lines , while in australia , they are red with black bands at one end . [SEP]
[CLS] in india , the most common pencil colour scheme was dark red with black lines , and pencil ##s with a large number of colour schemes are produced by various companies . [SEP]
