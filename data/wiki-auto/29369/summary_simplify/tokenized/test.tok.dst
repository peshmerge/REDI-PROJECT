[CLS] the test ##is in the male , and the o ##vary in the female , are called the " primary sex organs " . [SEP]
[CLS] the external sex organs â€“ the gen ##ital ##s or gen ##ital ##ia , visible at birth in both sexes , and the internal sex organs are called the secondary sex organs . [SEP]
[CLS] moss ##es , ferns , and some similar plants have game ##tang ##ia for reproductive organs , which are part of the game ##top ##hy ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] the flowers of flowering plants produce pollen and egg cells , but the sex organs themselves are inside the game ##top ##hy ##tes within the pollen and the o ##vu ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] the cones and pollen are not themselves sexual organs . [SEP]
[CLS] the latin term " gen ##ital ##ia " , sometimes ang ##lic ##ized as " gen ##ital ##s " , is used to describe the externally visible sex organs : in male mammals , the penis and sc ##rot ##um ; and in female mammals , the vu ##lva and its organs . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary sex organs are the go ##nad ##s , a pair of sex organs , specifically the test ##es in the male or the o ##var ##ies in the female . [SEP]
[CLS] they also produce most of the primary hormones that affect sexual development , and regulate other sexual organs and sexually differentiated behaviors . [SEP]
[CLS] in general zoology , given the great variety in organs , ph ##ys ##iol ##og ##ies , and behaviors involved in cop ##ulation , male gen ##ital ##ia are more strictly defined as " all male structures that are inserted in the female or that hold her near her go ##no ##pore during sperm transfer " ; female gen ##ital ##ia are defined as " those parts of the female reproductive tract that make direct contact with male gen ##ital ##ia or male products ( sperm , sperm ##ato ##ph ##ores ) during or immediately after cop ##ulation " . [SEP]
[CLS] in place ##ntal mammals , females have two gen ##ital or ##ifice ##s , the va ##gina and ur ##eth ##ra , while males have only one , the ur ##eth ##ra . [SEP]
[CLS] in most human societies , particularly in conservative ones , exposure of the gen ##ital ##s is considered a public ind ##ece ##ncy . [SEP]
[CLS] in typical pre ##nat ##al development , sex organs originate from a common pri ##mo ##rdi ##um during early ge ##station and differentiate into male or female sexes . [SEP]
[CLS] the sr ##y gene , usually located on the y chromosome and encoding the test ##is determining factor , determines the direction of this differentiation . [SEP]
[CLS] the absence of it allows the go ##nad ##s to continue to develop into o ##var ##ies . [SEP]
[CLS] thereafter , the development of the internal , and external reproductive organs is determined by hormones produced by certain fetal go ##nad ##s ( o ##var ##ies or test ##es ) and the cells ' response to them . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial appearance of the fetal gen ##ital ##ia looks basically feminine : a pair of " ur ##ogen ##ital folds " with a small pro ##tub ##eran ##ce in the middle , and the ur ##eth ##ra behind the pro ##tub ##eran ##ce . [SEP]
[CLS] if the fe ##tus has test ##es , and if the test ##es produce testosterone , and if the cells of the gen ##ital ##s respond to the testosterone , the outer ur ##ogen ##ital folds swell and fuse in the mid ##line to produce the sc ##rot ##um ; the pro ##tub ##eran ##ce grows larger and straight ##er to form the penis ; the inner ur ##ogen ##ital swelling ##s grow , wrap around the penis , and fuse in the mid ##line to form the pen ##ile ur ##eth ##ra . [SEP]
[CLS] in a larger perspective , the whole process of sexual differentiation also includes development of secondary sexual characteristics such as patterns of pub ##ic and facial hair and female breasts that emerge at pub ##erty . [SEP]
[CLS] once the child is born , the parents are faced with decisions that are often difficult to make , such as whether or not to modify the gen ##ital ##ia , assign the child as male or female , or leave the gen ##ital ##ia as is . [SEP]
[CLS] in many other animals a single posterior or ##ifice , called the cl ##oa ##ca , serves as the only opening for the reproductive , digest ##ive , and ur ##ina ##ry tracts ( if present ) . [SEP]
[CLS] all amp ##hi ##bians , birds , reptiles , some fish , and a few mammals ( mono ##tre ##mes , ten ##re ##cs , golden mole ##s , and mars ##up ##ial mole ##s ) have this or ##ifice , from which they ex ##cre ##te both urine and fe ##ces in addition to serving reproductive functions . [SEP]
[CLS] the organs concerned with insect mating and the deposition of eggs are known collectively as the external gen ##ital ##ia , although they may be largely internal ; their components are very diverse in form . [SEP]
[CLS] sexual plan ##aria are her ##ma ##ph ##rod ##ites , possessing both test ##icles and o ##var ##ies . [SEP]
[CLS] the life cycle of land plants involves alter ##nation of generations between a sp ##oro ##phy ##te and a ha ##pl ##oid game ##top ##hy ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] any sex organs that are produced by the plant will develop on the game ##top ##hy ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] sexual reproduction in flowering plants involves the union of the male and female ge ##rm cells , sperm and egg cells respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] pollen is produced in st ##amen ##s , and is carried to the pi ##sti ##l , which has the o ##vary at its base where fe ##rti ##lization can take place . [SEP]
