The testis in the male, and the ovary in the female, are called the "primary sex organs".
The external sex organs â€“ the genitals or genitalia, visible at birth in both sexes, and the internal sex organs are called the secondary sex organs.
Mosses, ferns, and some similar plants have gametangia for reproductive organs, which are part of the gametophyte.
The flowers of flowering plants produce pollen and egg cells, but the sex organs themselves are inside the gametophytes within the pollen and the ovule.
The cones and pollen are not themselves sexual organs.
The Latin term "genitalia", sometimes anglicized as "genitals", is used to describe the externally visible sex organs: in male mammals, the penis and scrotum; and in female mammals, the vulva and its organs.
The primary sex organs are the gonads, a pair of sex organs, specifically the testes in the male or the ovaries in the female.
They also produce most of the primary hormones that affect sexual development, and regulate other sexual organs and sexually differentiated behaviors.
In general zoology, given the great variety in organs, physiologies, and behaviors involved in copulation, male genitalia are more strictly defined as "all male structures that are inserted in the female or that hold her near her gonopore during sperm transfer"; female genitalia are defined as "those parts of the female reproductive tract that make direct contact with male genitalia or male products (sperm, spermatophores) during or immediately after copulation".
In placental mammals, females have two genital orifices, the vagina and urethra, while males have only one, the urethra.
In most human societies, particularly in conservative ones, exposure of the genitals is considered a public indecency.
In typical prenatal development, sex organs originate from a common primordium during early gestation and differentiate into male or female sexes.
The SRY gene, usually located on the Y chromosome and encoding the testis determining factor, determines the direction of this differentiation.
The absence of it allows the gonads to continue to develop into ovaries.
Thereafter, the development of the internal, and external reproductive organs is determined by hormones produced by certain fetal gonads (ovaries or testes) and the cells' response to them.
The initial appearance of the fetal genitalia looks basically feminine: a pair of "urogenital folds" with a small protuberance in the middle, and the urethra behind the protuberance.
If the fetus has testes, and if the testes produce testosterone, and if the cells of the genitals respond to the testosterone, the outer urogenital folds swell and fuse in the midline to produce the scrotum; the protuberance grows larger and straighter to form the penis; the inner urogenital swellings grow, wrap around the penis, and fuse in the midline to form the penile urethra.
In a larger perspective, the whole process of sexual differentiation also includes development of secondary sexual characteristics such as patterns of pubic and facial hair and female breasts that emerge at puberty.
Once the child is born, the parents are faced with decisions that are often difficult to make, such as whether or not to modify the genitalia, assign the child as male or female, or leave the genitalia as is.
In many other animals a single posterior orifice, called the cloaca, serves as the only opening for the reproductive, digestive, and urinary tracts (if present).
All amphibians, birds, reptiles, some fish, and a few mammals (monotremes, tenrecs, golden moles, and marsupial moles) have this orifice, from which they excrete both urine and feces in addition to serving reproductive functions.
The organs concerned with insect mating and the deposition of eggs are known collectively as the external genitalia, although they may be largely internal; their components are very diverse in form.
Sexual planaria are hermaphrodites, possessing both testicles and ovaries.
The life cycle of land plants involves alternation of generations between a sporophyte and a haploid gametophyte.
Any sex organs that are produced by the plant will develop on the gametophyte.
Sexual reproduction in flowering plants involves the union of the male and female germ cells, sperm and egg cells respectively.
Pollen is produced in stamens, and is carried to the pistil, which has the ovary at its base where fertilization can take place.
