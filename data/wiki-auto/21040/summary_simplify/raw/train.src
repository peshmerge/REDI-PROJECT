Mafic is an adjective describing a silicate mineral or igneous rock that is rich in magnesium and iron, and is thus a portmanteau of magnesium and ferric.
Most mafic minerals are dark in color, and common rock-forming mafic minerals include olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite.
Chemically, mafic rocks are enriched in iron, magnesium and calcium and typically dark in color.
In contrast the felsic rocks are typically light in color and enriched in aluminium and silicon along with potassium and sodium.
The mafic rocks also typically have a higher density than felsic rocks.
Mafic lava, before cooling, has a low viscosity, in comparison with felsic lava, due to the lower silica content in mafic magma.
Water and other volatiles can more easily and gradually escape from mafic lava.
