[CLS] ma ##fi ##c is an adjective describing a si ##lica ##te mineral or ign ##eous rock that is rich in magnesium and iron , and is thus a port ##man ##tea ##u of magnesium and fe ##rri ##c . [SEP]
[CLS] most ma ##fi ##c minerals are dark in color , and common rock - forming ma ##fi ##c minerals include ol ##iv ##ine , p ##yr ##ox ##ene , amp ##hi ##bol ##e , and bio ##tite . [SEP]
[CLS] common ma ##fi ##c rocks include basalt , dia ##base and ga ##bb ##ro . [SEP]
[CLS] ma ##fi ##c rocks often also contain calcium - rich varieties of pl ##agi ##oc ##lase fe ##ld ##spar . [SEP]
[CLS] chemical ##ly , ma ##fi ##c rocks are enriched in iron , magnesium and calcium and typically dark in color . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast the fe ##ls ##ic rocks are typically light in color and enriched in aluminium and silicon along with potassium and sodium . [SEP]
[CLS] the ma ##fi ##c rocks also typically have a higher density than fe ##ls ##ic rocks . [SEP]
[CLS] the term roughly corresponds to the older " basic rock " class . [SEP]
[CLS] ma ##fi ##c lava , before cooling , has a low vis ##cos ##ity , in comparison with fe ##ls ##ic lava , due to the lower si ##lica content in ma ##fi ##c magma . [SEP]
[CLS] water and other volatile ##s can more easily and gradually escape from ma ##fi ##c lava . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , eruptions of volcanoes made of ma ##fi ##c lava ##s are less explosive ##ly violent than fe ##ls ##ic - lava eruptions . [SEP]
[CLS] most ma ##fi ##c - lava volcanoes are shield volcanoes , like those in hawaii . [SEP]
