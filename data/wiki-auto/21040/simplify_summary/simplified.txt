mafic is an adjective describing a silicate mineral or igneous rock that is rich in magnesium and iron .
most mafic minerals are dark in color , and common rock-forming mafic minerals include olivine , pyroxene , amphibole , biotite , and olivine .
common mafic rocks include basalt , diabase and gabbro .
mafic rocks often contain calcium-rich varieties of plagioclase feldspar .
mafic rocks are made of iron , magnesium and calcium .
the felsic rocks are usually light in colour and are enriched in aluminium and silicon along with potassium and sodium .
the mafic rocks also have higher density than felsic rocks .
the term roughly corresponds to the older " basic rock " class .
mafic lava , before cooling , has a lower viscosity compared with felsic lava , due to the lower silica content in mafic magma .
water and other volatiles can more easily .
as a result , eruptions of mafic lavas are less explosively violent than felsic-lava eruptions .
most mafic lava volcanoes are oceanic volcanoes .
