[CLS] crystal ##log ##raphy is the experimental science of determining the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids ( see crystal structure ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 2012 , the united nations recognised the importance of the science of crystal ##log ##raphy by pro ##claiming that 2014 would be the international year of crystal ##log ##raphy . [SEP]
[CLS] x - ray crystal ##log ##raphy is used to determine the structure of large bio ##mo ##le ##cule ##s such as proteins . [SEP]
[CLS] before the development of x - ray di ##ff ##raction crystal ##log ##raphy ( see below ) , the study of crystals was based on physical measurements of their geometry . [SEP]
[CLS] this involved measuring the angles of crystal faces relative to each other and to theoretical reference axes ( crystal ##log ##raphic axes ) , and establishing the symmetry of the crystal in question . [SEP]
[CLS] this physical measurement is carried out using a go ##nio ##meter . [SEP]
[CLS] the position in 3d space of each crystal face is plotted on a stereo ##graphic net such as a wu ##lf ##f net or lambert net . [SEP]
[CLS] crystal ##log ##raphic methods now depend on analysis of the di ##ff ##raction patterns of a sample targeted by a beam of some type . [SEP]
[CLS] crystal ##log ##raph ##ers often explicitly state the type of beam used , as in the terms " x - ray crystal ##log ##raphy , neutron di ##ff ##raction " and " electron di ##ff ##raction " . [SEP]
[CLS] employing shorter wavelengths implied abandoning microscopy and true imaging , however , because there exists no material from which a lens capable of focusing this type of radiation can be created . [SEP]
[CLS] scientists have had some success focusing x - rays with microscopic fr ##es ##nel zone plates made from gold , and by critical - angle reflection inside long tape ##red cap ##illa ##ries . [SEP]
[CLS] sharp features in the di ##ff ##raction pattern arise from periodic , repeating structure in the sample , which are often very strong due to coherent reflection of many photon ##s from many regularly spaced instances of similar structure , while non - periodic components of the structure result in diffuse ( and usually weak ) di ##ff ##raction features - areas with a higher density and repetition of atom order tend to reflect more light toward one point in space when compared to those areas with fewer atoms and less repetition . [SEP]
[CLS] because of their highly ordered and repetitive structure , crystals give di ##ff ##raction patterns of sharp bragg reflection spots , and are ideal for analyzing the structure of solids . [SEP]
[CLS] water in the drop diffuse ##s to the reservoir , slowly increasing the concentration and allowing a crystal to form . [SEP]
[CLS] if the concentration were to rise more quickly , the molecule would simply pre ##ci ##pit ##ate out of solution , resulting in disorder ##ly gran ##ules rather than an orderly and hence usable crystal . [SEP]
[CLS] although many universities that engage in crystal ##log ##raphic research have their own x - ray producing equipment , sync ##hr ##ot ##rons are often used as x - ray sources , because of the pure ##r and more complete patterns such sources can generate . [SEP]
[CLS] sync ##hr ##ot ##ron sources also have a much higher intensity of x - ray beams , so data collection takes a fraction of the time normally necessary at weaker sources . [SEP]
[CLS] complementary neutron crystal ##log ##raphy techniques are used to identify the positions of hydrogen atoms , since x - rays only interact very weakly with light elements such as hydrogen . [SEP]
[CLS] in this process , the mathematical ##ly predicted di ##ff ##raction patterns of an h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized or " model " structure are compared to the actual pattern generated by the crystalline sample . [SEP]
[CLS] models are refined until their predicted patterns match to as great a degree as can be achieved without radical revision of the model . [SEP]
[CLS] hence crystal ##log ##raphy applies for the most part only to crystals , or to molecules which can be coa ##xed to crystal ##li ##ze for the sake of measurement . [SEP]
[CLS] in spite of this , a certain amount of molecular information can be de ##duced from patterns that are generated by fibers and powder ##s , which while not as perfect as a solid crystal , may exhibit a degree of order . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the double - he ##lica ##l structure of dna was de ##duced from an x - ray di ##ff ##raction pattern that had been generated by a fi ##bro ##us sample . [SEP]
[CLS] crystal ##log ##raphy is used by materials scientists to character ##ize different materials . [SEP]
[CLS] in single crystals , the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macro ##scopic ##ally , because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure . [SEP]
[CLS] because of this , the powder di ##ff ##raction method , which takes di ##ff ##raction patterns of poly ##cr ##yst ##all ##ine samples with a large number of crystals , plays an important role in structural determination . [SEP]
[CLS] clay can be easily def ##or ##med because the plate ##like particles can slip along each other in the plane of the plates , yet remain strongly connected in the direction perpendicular to the plates . [SEP]
[CLS] when manufacturing or using a material , it is generally desirable to know what compounds and what phases are present in the material , as their composition , structure and proportions will influence the material ' s properties . [SEP]
[CLS] x - ray or neutron di ##ff ##raction can be used to identify which patterns are present in the material , and thus which compounds are present . [SEP]
[CLS] crystal ##log ##raphy covers the en ##ume ##ration of the symmetry patterns which can be formed by atoms in a crystal and for this reason is related to group theory and geometry . [SEP]
[CLS] the first crystal structure of a macro ##mo ##le ##cule was solved in 1958 , a three - dimensional model of the my ##og ##lo ##bin molecule obtained by x - ray analysis . [SEP]
[CLS] the protein data bank ( pd ##b ) is a freely accessible repository for the structures of proteins and other biological macro ##mo ##le ##cule ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] neutron crystal ##log ##raphy is often used to help ref ##ine structures obtained by x - ray methods or to solve a specific bond ; the methods are often viewed as complementary , as x - rays are sensitive to electron positions and sc ##atter most strongly off heavy atoms , while neutron ##s are sensitive to nucleus positions and sc ##atter strongly even off many light isotope ##s , including hydrogen and de ##uter ##ium . [SEP]
[CLS] electron crystal ##log ##raphy has been used to determine some protein structures , most notably membrane proteins and viral caps ##ids . [SEP]
[CLS] the series contains books that covers analysis methods and the mathematical procedures for determining organic structure though x - ray crystal ##log ##raphy , electron di ##ff ##raction , and neutron di ##ff ##raction . [SEP]
[CLS] the international tables are focused on procedures , techniques and descriptions and do not list the physical properties of individual crystals themselves . [SEP]
