[CLS] data storage is the recording ( storing ) of information ( data ) in a storage medium . [SEP]
[CLS] dna and rna , handwriting , ph ##ono ##graphic recording , magnetic tape , and optical discs are all examples of storage media . [SEP]
[CLS] recording is accomplished by virtually any form of energy . [SEP]
[CLS] electronic data storage requires electrical power to store and retrieve data . [SEP]
[CLS] data storage in a digital , machine - read ##able medium is sometimes called " digital data " . [SEP]
[CLS] computer data storage is one of the core functions of a general purpose computer . [SEP]
[CLS] electronic documents can be stored in much less space than paper documents . [SEP]
[CLS] bar ##codes and magnetic ink character recognition ( mic ##r ) are two ways of recording machine - read ##able data on paper . [SEP]
[CLS] a recording medium is a physical material that holds information . [SEP]
[CLS] newly created information is distributed and can be stored in four storage media – print , film , magnetic , and optical – and seen or heard in four information flows – telephone , radio and tv , and the internet as well as being observed directly . [SEP]
[CLS] digital information is stored on electronic media in many different recording formats . [SEP]
[CLS] with electronic media , the data and the recording media are sometimes referred to as " software " despite the more common use of the word to describe computer software . [SEP]
[CLS] with ( traditional art ) static media , art materials such as cr ##ayo ##ns may be considered both equipment and medium as the wax , charcoal or chalk material from the equipment becomes part of the surface of the medium . [SEP]
[CLS] some recording media may be temporary either by design or by nature . [SEP]
[CLS] volatile organic compounds may be used to preserve the environment or to purposely make data ex ##pire over time . [SEP]
[CLS] data such as smoke signals or sky ##writing are temporary by nature . [SEP]
[CLS] depending on the vol ##ati ##lity , a gas ( e . g . atmosphere , smoke ) or a liquid surface such as a lake would be considered a temporary recording medium if at all . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2003 uc berkeley report estimated that about five ex ##aby ##tes of new information were produced in 2002 , and that 92 % of this data was stored on hard disk drives . [SEP]
[CLS] this was about twice the data produced in 2000 . [SEP]
[CLS] the amount of data transmitted over telecommunication systems in 2002 was nearly 18 ex ##aby ##tes — three and a half times more than was recorded on non - volatile storage . [SEP]
[CLS] telephone calls constituted 98 % of the telecom ##mun ##icated information in 2002 . [SEP]
[CLS] the researchers ' highest estimate for the growth rate of newly stored information ( un ##com ##pressed ) was more than 30 % per year . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been estimated that the year 2002 was the beginning of the digital age for information storage : an age in which more information is stored on digital storage devices than on analog storage devices . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1986 , approximately 1 % of the world ' s capacity to store information was in digital format ; this grew to 3 % by 1993 , to 25 % by 2000 , and to 97 % by 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] these figures correspond to less than three compressed ex ##aby ##tes in 1986 , and 295 compressed ex ##aby ##tes in 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] the quantity of digital storage doubled roughly every three years . [SEP]
[CLS] in a more limited study , the international data corporation estimated that the total amount of digital data in 2007 was 281 ex ##aby ##tes , and that the total amount of digital data produced exceeded the global storage capacity for the first time . [SEP]
[CLS] a study published in 2011 estimated that the world ' s technological capacity to store information in analog and digital devices grew from less than three ( optimal ##ly compressed ) ex ##aby ##tes in 1986 , to 295 ( optimal ##ly compressed ) ex ##aby ##tes in 2007 , and doubles roughly every three years .
