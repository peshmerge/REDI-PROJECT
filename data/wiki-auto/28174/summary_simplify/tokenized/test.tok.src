[CLS] recording is accomplished by virtually any form of energy . [SEP]
[CLS] computer data storage is one of the core functions of a general purpose computer . [SEP]
[CLS] newly created information is distributed and can be stored in four storage media – print , film , magnetic , and optical – and seen or heard in four information flows – telephone , radio and tv , and the internet as well as being observed directly . [SEP]
[CLS] with electronic media , the data and the recording media are sometimes referred to as " software " despite the more common use of the word to describe computer software . [SEP]
[CLS] with ( traditional art ) static media , art materials such as cr ##ayo ##ns may be considered both equipment and medium as the wax , charcoal or chalk material from the equipment becomes part of the surface of the medium . [SEP]
[CLS] some recording media may be temporary either by design or by nature . [SEP]
[CLS] volatile organic compounds may be used to preserve the environment or to purposely make data ex ##pire over time . [SEP]
[CLS] atmosphere , smoke ) or a liquid surface such as a lake would be considered a temporary recording medium if at all . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2003 uc berkeley report estimated that about five ex ##aby ##tes of new information were produced in 2002 , and that 92 % of this data was stored on hard disk drives . [SEP]
[CLS] the amount of data transmitted over telecommunication systems in 2002 was nearly 18 ex ##aby ##tes — three and a half times more than was recorded on non - volatile storage . [SEP]
[CLS] the researchers ' highest estimate for the growth rate of newly stored information ( un ##com ##pressed ) was more than 30 % per year . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been estimated that the year 2002 was the beginning of the digital age for information storage : an age in which more information is stored on digital storage devices than on analog storage devices . [SEP]
[CLS] these figures correspond to less than three compressed ex ##aby ##tes in 1986 , and 295 compressed ex ##aby ##tes in 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] in a more limited study , the international data corporation estimated that the total amount of digital data in 2007 was 281 ex ##aby ##tes , and that the total amount of digital data produced exceeded the global storage capacity for the first time . [SEP]
[CLS] a study published in 2011 estimated that the world ' s technological capacity to store information in analog and digital devices grew from less than three ( optimal ##ly compressed ) ex ##aby ##tes in 1986 , to 295 ( optimal ##ly compressed ) ex ##aby ##tes in 2007 , and doubles roughly every three years .
