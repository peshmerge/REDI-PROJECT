[CLS] in an encryption scheme , the intended information or message , referred to as plain ##text , is en ##cr ##yp ##ted using an encryption algorithm – a cipher – generating cipher ##text that can be read only if dec ##ry ##pt ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] for technical reasons , an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo - random encryption key generated by an algorithm . [SEP]
[CLS] it is in principle possible to dec ##ry ##pt the message without possessing the key , but , for a well - designed encryption scheme , considerable computational resources and skills are required . [SEP]
[CLS] an authorized recipient can easily dec ##ry ##pt the message with the key provided by the origin ##ator to recipients but not to unauthorized users . [SEP]
[CLS] an example of a symmetric key is the german military ' s enigma machine . [SEP]
[CLS] when the allies figured out how the machine worked , they were able to dec ##ip ##her the information encoded within the messages as soon as they could discover the encryption key for a given day ' s transmissions . [SEP]
[CLS] in public - key encryption schemes , the encryption key is published for anyone to use and en ##cr ##yp ##t messages . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the computer security institute reported that in 2007 , 71 % of companies surveyed utilized encryption for some of their data in transit , and 53 % utilized encryption for some of their data in storage . [SEP]
[CLS] encryption can be used to protect data " at rest " , such as information stored on computers and storage devices ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] in recent years , there have been numerous reports of confidential data , such as customers ' personal records , being exposed through loss or theft of laptop ##s or backup drives ; en ##cr ##yp ##ting such files at rest helps protect them if physical security measures fail . [SEP]
[CLS] digital rights management systems , which prevent unauthorized use or reproduction of copyright ##ed material and protect software against reverse engineering ( see also copy protection ) , is another somewhat different example of using encryption on data at rest . [SEP]
[CLS] encryption is also used to protect data in transit , for example data being transferred via networks ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] data should also be en ##cr ##yp ##ted when transmitted across networks in order to protect against ea ##ves ##drop ##ping of network traffic by unauthorized users . [SEP]
[CLS] conventional methods for del ##eti ##ng data permanently from a storage device involve over ##writing its whole content with zero ##s , ones or other patterns – a process which can take a significant amount of time , depending on the capacity and the type of the medium . [SEP]
[CLS] an example implementation of this method can be found on ios devices , where the crypt ##ographic key is kept in a dedicated ' e ##ffa ##cea ##ble storage ' . [SEP]
[CLS] because the key is stored on the same device , this setup on its own does not offer full confidential ##ity protection in case an unauthorized person gains physical access to the device . [SEP]
[CLS] encryption is an important tool but is not sufficient alone to ensure the security or privacy of sensitive information throughout its lifetime . [SEP]
[CLS] data fragmentation and active defense data protection technologies attempt to counter some of these attacks , by distributing , moving , or mu ##tat ##ing cipher ##text so it is more difficult to identify , steal , corrupt , or destroy . [SEP]
[CLS] encryption , by itself , can protect the confidential ##ity of messages , but other techniques are still needed to protect the integrity and authenticity of a message ; for example , verification of a message authentication code ( mac ) or a digital signature . [SEP]
[CLS] integrity protection mechanisms such as mac ##s and digital signatures must be applied to the cipher ##text when it is first created , typically on the same device used to compose the message , to protect a message end - to - end along its full transmission path ; otherwise , any node between the send ##er and the encryption agent could potentially tam ##per with it . [SEP]
[CLS] en ##cr ##yp ##ting at the time of creation is only secure if the encryption device itself has correct keys and has not been tam ##per ##ed with . [SEP]
[CLS] if an end ##point device has been configured to trust a root certificate that an attacker controls , for example , then the attacker can both inspect and tam ##per with en ##cr ##yp ##ted data by performing a man - in - the - middle attack anywhere along the message ' s path . [SEP]
[CLS] the common practice of t ##ls interception by network operators represents a controlled and institutional ##ly sanctioned form of such an attack , but countries have also attempted to employ such attacks as a form of control and censorship . [SEP]
[CLS] even when encryption correctly hides a message ' s content and it cannot be tam ##per ##ed with at rest or in transit , a message ' s " length " is a form of metadata that can still leak sensitive information about the message . [SEP]
[CLS] the well - known crime and breach attacks against https were side - channel attacks that relied on information leak ##age via the length of en ##cr ##yp ##ted content , for example . [SEP]
[CLS] pad ##ding a message ' s payload before en ##cr ##yp ##ting it can help obscure the clear ##text ' s true length , at a cost of increasing the cipher ##text ' s size and introducing bandwidth overhead . [SEP]
[CLS] messages may be padded randomly or deter ##mini ##stic ##ally , each approach having different trade ##offs . [SEP]
[CLS] en ##cr ##yp ##ting and pad ##ding messages to form padded uniform random b ##lo ##bs or pu ##rb ##s is a practice guarantee ##ing that the cipher text leaks no metadata about its clear ##text ' s content , and leaks as ##ym ##pt ##otic ##ally minimal formula _ 1 information via its length .
