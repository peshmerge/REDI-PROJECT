Suizei is known as a "legendary emperor" among historians as his actual existence is disputed.
A legendary account from the Kojiki states that Suizei became emperor after receiving the title of crown prince by his half brother due to his bravery regarding a murder plot.
Suizei's reign started in 581 BC, he had one wife and a sole son who supposedly became the next emperor upon his death in 549 BC.
While the "Kojiki" provides little information about Suizei, it does state his name, genealogy, and a record about his accession to the throne.
He was born sometime in 632 BC, and was one of the sons of Emperor Jimmu and his chief wife Himetataraisuzu-hime.
The account in the Kojiki states that Suizei's older brother Kamuyaimimi was originally the Crown-prince.
When Jimmu died, another of his sons named Tagishimimi attempted to seize the throne by murdering those in his way.
Tagishimimi was given birth to by a lesser wife named Ahiratsu-hime, and was older than Jimmu's legitimate heir.
When Himetataraisuzu-hime learned of the plot she tried in vain to warn her sons by way of songs and poems.
Suizei pleaded with his older brother for the weapon he was going to use, and upon receiving it accomplished the deed for him.
Emperor Suizei's pre-ascension name remains unknown, but the "Kojiki" records that he ruled from the palace of Takaoka-no-miya (葛城高岡宮 ) at Katsuragi in what would come to be known as Yamato Province.
Suizei is thus regarded by historians as a "legendary Emperor", and is ranked as the first of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them.
His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Suizei, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the Yamato dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the "Kojiki".
While the actual site of his grave is not known, an Imperial "misasagi" or tomb for Suizei is currently maintained in Kashihara.
The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as "traditional" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.
