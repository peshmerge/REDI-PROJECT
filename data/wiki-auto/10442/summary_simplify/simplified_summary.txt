suizei is almost certainly a legend .
suizei became emperor after receiving the title of crown prince by his half brother due to his bravery regarding a murder plot .
suizei 's reign started in 581 bc .
the " kojiki " records only his name and genealogy .
he was the son of emperor jimmu .
the account in the kojiki states that suizei 's older brother kamuyaimimi was originally the crown prince .
when jimmu died , another of his sons named tagishimimi tried to seize the throne by murdering those in his way .
tagishimimi was born to a lesser wife named ahiratsu-hime .
himetataraisuzu-hime tried to tell her sons by way of songs and poems .
suizei pleaded with his older brother for the weapon he was going to use , and upon receiving it the accomplished deed for him .
emperor suizei 's pre-ascension name is unknown , but the " kojiki " records that he ruled from the palace of takaoka-no-miya ( [unk] 城 高 岡 宮tiv 宮gement in what would come to be known as yamato province .
historians consider emperor suizei to be the first of eight emperors without legends associated with them .
this emperor 's official name after his death -lrb- his posthumous name -rrb- was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to suizei .
the actual site of his grave is not known .
the conventionally accepted names and dates of the early emperors were not confirmed as traditional .
