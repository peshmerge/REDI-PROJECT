he was the son of emperor jimmu .
the account in the kojiki states that suizei 's older brother kamuyaimimi was originally the crown prince .

suizei pleaded with his older brother for the weapon he was going to use , and upon receiving it the accomplished deed for him .
kamuyawimimi gave his rights as crown prince shortly after to suizei as he believed his braver younger brother should be the new emperor .
emperor suizei 's pre-ascension name is unknown , but the " kojiki " records that he ruled from the palace of takaoka-no-miya ( [unk] 城 高 岡 宮tiv 宮gement in what would come to be known as yamato province .
while another more expansive account exists in the " nihon shoki " , the section is more steeped in myth .
