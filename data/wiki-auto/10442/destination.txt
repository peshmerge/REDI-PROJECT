Emperor Suizei (綏靖天皇, "Suizei-tennō") was the 2nd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
Historians consider Emperor Suizei to be a legendary person, and the name Suizei"-tennō" was created for him after his death by later generations.
No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign.
The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.
The "Gukanshō" records that Suizei ruled from the palace of "Takaoka-no-miya" at Katsuragi in what will come to be known as Yamato province.
Suizei is almost certainly a legend.
The "Kojiki" records only his name and genealogy.
The "Nihonshoki" includes Suizei as the earliest or first of "eight undocumented monarchs" (欠史八代, "Kesshi-hachidai").
The "Gukanshō" records that Suizei was one of the sons of Emperor Jimmu.
During reign of Emperor Suizei, the capital of Japan was at Kazuraki, Yamato.
The Kojiki includes a story about how Suizei attained the throne.
His older brother supported Suizei because of his courage.
The absence of information about Suizei does not imply that no such person ever existed.
Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei (509?-
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Suizei.
The actual site of his grave is not known.
According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara.
