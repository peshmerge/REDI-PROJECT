The Ostwald process is a chemical process for making nitric acid (HNO).
The Ostwald process is a mainstay of the modern chemical industry, and it provides the main raw material for the most common type of fertilizer production.
Ammonia is converted to nitric acid in 2 stages.
It is oxidized by heating with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum with 10% rhodium, platinum metal on fused silica wool, copper or nickel, to form nitric oxide (nitrogen(II) oxide) and water/steam.
The NO is recycled, and the acid is concentrated to the required strength by distillation.
This is a secondary reaction that is minimised by reducing the time the gas mixtures are in contact with the catalyst.
