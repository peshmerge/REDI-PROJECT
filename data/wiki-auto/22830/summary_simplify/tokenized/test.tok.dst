[CLS] the os ##t ##wald process is a chemical process for making ni ##tric acid ( h ##no ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the os ##t ##wald process is a main ##sta ##y of the modern chemical industry , and it provides the main raw material for the most common type of fe ##rti ##lizer production . [SEP]
[CLS] ammonia is converted to ni ##tric acid in 2 stages . [SEP]
[CLS] it is ox ##idi ##zed by heating with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum with 10 % r ##ho ##dium , platinum metal on fused si ##lica wool , copper or nickel , to form ni ##tric oxide ( nitrogen ( ii ) oxide ) and water / steam . [SEP]
[CLS] the no is recycled , and the acid is concentrated to the required strength by di ##sti ##llation . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a secondary reaction that is mini ##mise ##d by reducing the time the gas mixture ##s are in contact with the catalyst . [SEP]
