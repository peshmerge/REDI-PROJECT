[CLS] the os ##t ##wald process is a chemical process for making ni ##tric acid ( h ##no ) . [SEP]
[CLS] wilhelm os ##t ##wald developed the process , and he patented it in 1902 . [SEP]
[CLS] the os ##t ##wald process is a main ##sta ##y of the modern chemical industry , and it provides the main raw material for the most common type of fe ##rti ##lizer production . [SEP]
[CLS] historically and practically , the os ##t ##wald process is closely associated with the ha ##ber process , which provides the re ##quisite raw material , ammonia ( nh ) . [SEP]
[CLS] ammonia is converted to ni ##tric acid in 2 stages . [SEP]
[CLS] it is ox ##idi ##zed by heating with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum with 10 % r ##ho ##dium , platinum metal on fused si ##lica wool , copper or nickel , to form ni ##tric oxide ( nitrogen ( ii ) oxide ) and water / steam . [SEP]
[CLS] stage two encompasses two reactions and is carried out in an absorption apparatus containing water . [SEP]
[CLS] initially ni ##tric oxide is ox ##idi ##zed again to yield nitrogen dioxide ( nitrogen ( iv ) oxide ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the no is recycled , and the acid is concentrated to the required strength by di ##sti ##llation . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a secondary reaction that is mini ##mise ##d by reducing the time the gas mixture ##s are in contact with the catalyst . [SEP]
