the ostwald process is a chemical process for making nitric acidhend hnoguchi gas .
wilhelm ostwald developed the process and patented it in 1902 .
the ostwald process is a mainstay of the modern chemical industry .
the ostwald process is closely associated with the haber process .
ammonia is converted to nitric acid in two stages .
it is oxidized by heating with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum , platinum metal on fused silica wool , copper or nickel , to form nitric oxide oxideloid iimonium oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxideloid and water / steam .
stage two is the process of taking out two reactions .
it is oxidized to produce nitrogen dioxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide gaston .
the no is recycled , and the acid is concentrated to the required strength by distillation .
this is a secondary reaction by reducing the amount of time the gas mixtures are in contact with the catalyst .
