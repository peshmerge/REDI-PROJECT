The Ostwald process is a chemical process for making nitric acid (HNO).
Wilhelm Ostwald developed the process, and he patented it in 1902.
The Ostwald process is a mainstay of the modern chemical industry, and it provides the main raw material for the most common type of fertilizer production.
Historically and practically, the Ostwald process is closely associated with the Haber process, which provides the requisite raw material, ammonia (NH).
Ammonia is converted to nitric acid in 2 stages.
It is oxidized by heating with oxygen in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum with 10% rhodium, platinum metal on fused silica wool, copper or nickel, to form nitric oxide (nitrogen(II) oxide) and water/steam.
Stage two encompasses two reactions and is carried out in an absorption apparatus containing water.
Initially nitric oxide is oxidized again to yield nitrogen dioxide (nitrogen(IV) oxide).
The NO is recycled, and the acid is concentrated to the required strength by distillation.
This is a secondary reaction that is minimised by reducing the time the gas mixtures are in contact with the catalyst.
