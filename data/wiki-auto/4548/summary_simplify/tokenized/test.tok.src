[CLS] a blizzard is a severe snow ##storm characterized by strong sustained winds of at least 56 km / h and lasting for a prolonged period of time — typically three hours or more . [SEP]
[CLS] blizzard ##s can have an immense size and usually stretch to hundreds or thousands of kilometres . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , the national weather service defines a blizzard as a severe snow storm characterized by strong winds causing blowing snow that results in low vis ##ib ##ili ##ties . [SEP]
[CLS] the difference between a blizzard and a snow ##storm is the strength of the wind , not the amount of snow . [SEP]
[CLS] to be a blizzard , a snow storm must have sustained winds or frequent gust ##s that are greater than or equal to 56 km / h with blowing or drifting snow which reduces visibility to 400 m or less and must last for a prolonged period of time — typically three hours or more . [SEP]
[CLS] while severe cold and large amounts of drifting snow may accompany blizzard ##s , they are not required . [SEP]
[CLS] in antarctica , blizzard ##s are associated with winds spilling over the edge of the ice plateau at an average velocity of 160 km / h . [SEP]
[CLS] ground blizzard refers to a weather condition where loose snow or ice on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary difference between a ground blizzard as opposed to a regular blizzard is that in a ground blizzard no precipitation is produced at the time , but rather all the precipitation is already present in the form of snow or ice at the surface . [SEP]
[CLS] the australia bureau of meteor ##ology describes a blizzard as , " violent and very cold wind which is laden with snow , some part , at least , of which has been raised from snow covered ground . " [SEP]
[CLS] the " oxford english dictionary " concludes the term " blizzard " is likely ono ##mat ##op ##oe ##ic , derived from the same sense as " blow , blast , b ##list ##er , and blu ##ster " ; the first recorded use of it for weather dates to 1829 , when it was defined as a " violent blow " . [SEP]
[CLS] when cold , moist air from the pacific ocean moves eastward to the rocky mountains and the great plains , and warmer , moist air moves north from the gulf of mexico , all that is needed is a movement of cold polar air moving south to form potential blizzard conditions that may extend from the texas pan ##hand ##le to the great lakes and midwest . [SEP]
[CLS] another storm system occurs when a cold core low over the hudson bay area in canada is displaced southward over southeastern canada , the great lakes , and new england . [SEP]
[CLS] low pressure systems moving out of the rocky mountains onto the great plains , a broad expanse of flat land , much of it covered in prairie , steppe and grassland , can cause thunder ##storm ##s and rain to the south and heavy snow ##s and strong winds to the north . [SEP]
[CLS] with few trees or other obstruction ##s to reduce wind and blowing , this part of the country is particularly vulnerable to blizzard ##s with very low temperatures and white ##out conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] people can become lost in their own front yards , when the door is only 10 ft away , and they would have to feel their way back . [SEP]
[CLS] it gets its name from the direction the wind is coming from . [SEP]
[CLS] more specifically it describes a low - pressure area whose center of rotation is just off the coast and whose leading winds in the left - forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast . [SEP]
[CLS] it dropped 40 - of snow and had sustained winds of more than 45 mph that produced snow ##dr ##if ##ts in excess of 50 ft . [SEP]
[CLS] railroads were shut down and people were confined to their houses for up to a week . [SEP]
[CLS] many children — and their parents — learned of " the snow winter " through the children ' s book " the long winter " by laura ing ##all ##s wilder , in which the author tells of her family ' s efforts to survive . [SEP]
[CLS] accurate details in wilder ' s novel include the blizzard ##s ' frequency and the deep cold , the chicago and north western railway stopping trains until the spring tha ##w because the snow made the tracks imp ##ass ##able , the near - starvation of the townspeople , and the courage of her future husband alma ##nzo and another man , who ventured out on the open prairie in search of a cache of wheat that no one was even sure existed . [SEP]
[CLS] the october blizzard brought snowfall ##s so deep that two - story homes had snow up to the second floor windows . [SEP]
[CLS] no one was prepared for the deep snow so early in the season and farmers all over the region were caught before their crops had even been harvested , their grain mill ##ed , or with their fuel supplies for the winter in place . [SEP]
[CLS] by january the train service was almost entirely suspended from the region . [SEP]
[CLS] railroads hired scores of men to dig out the tracks but it was a wasted effort : as soon as they had finished shovel ##ing a stretch of line , a new storm arrived , filling up the line and leaving their work useless . [SEP]
[CLS] there were no winter tha ##ws and on february 2 , 1881 , a second massive blizzard struck that lasted for nine days . [SEP]
[CLS] in the towns the streets were filled with solid drift ##s to the tops of the buildings and tunnel ##ing was needed to secure passage about town . [SEP]
[CLS] the storm of the century , also known as the great blizzard of 1993 , was a large cy ##cl ##onic storm that formed over the gulf of mexico on march 12 , 1993 , and dissipated in the north atlantic ocean on march 15 . [SEP]
[CLS] at its height , the storm stretched from canada towards central america , but its main impact was on the united states and cuba . [SEP]
[CLS] areas as far south as northern alabama and georgia received a dustin ##g of snow and areas such as birmingham , alabama , received up to 12 in with hurricane - force wind gust ##s and record low bar ##ometric pressures . [SEP]
[CLS] between louisiana and cuba , hurricane - force winds produced high storm surge ##s across northwestern florida , which along with scattered tornadoes killed dozens of people . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , the storm was responsible for the loss of electric power to over 10 million customers . [SEP]
