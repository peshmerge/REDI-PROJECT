[CLS] in linguistics , grammar ( from ancient greek ) is the set of structural rules governing the composition of clauses , phrases and words in a natural language . [SEP]
[CLS] the term refers also to the study of such rules and this field includes ph ##ono ##logy , morphology and syntax , often complement ##ed by phonetic ##s , semantics and pr ##ag ##matic ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] fluent speakers of a language variety or " le ##ct " have a set of internal ##ized rules for using that form of speech . [SEP]
[CLS] the vast majority of the information in the grammar is – at least in the case of one ' s native language – acquired not by conscious study or instruction but by hearing other speakers . [SEP]
[CLS] much of this work is done during early childhood ; learning a language later in life usually involves a greater degree of explicit instruction . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " grammar " can also be used to describe the rules that govern the linguistic behavior of a group of speakers . [SEP]
[CLS] it may refer to the whole of english grammar ; that is , to the grammar ##s of all the speakers of the language , in which case the term encompasses a great deal of variation . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatively , it may refer only to what is common to the grammar ##s of all or of the vast majority of english speakers ( such as subject – verb – object word order in simple dec ##lar ##ative sentences ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it may also refer to the rules of a particular , relatively well - defined variety of english ( such as standard english for a region ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this kind of linguistic description contrasts with linguistic prescription , an attempt to actively discourage or suppress some grammatical constructions , while cod ##ifying and promoting others , either in an absolute sense or in reference to a standard variety . [SEP]
[CLS] john dry ##den ( 13 april 166 ##8 – january 1688 ) objected to it ( without explanation ) , leading other english speakers to avoid the construction and discourage its use . [SEP]
[CLS] it may be used more broadly to include rules of spelling and pun ##ct ##uation , which linguist ##s would not typically consider to form part of grammar but rather as a part of or ##th ##ography , the conventions used for writing a language . [SEP]
[CLS] it may also be used more narrowly to refer to a set of pre ##script ##ive norms only , excluding those aspects of a language ' s grammar that are not subject to variation or debate on their norma ##tive accept ##ability . [SEP]
[CLS] jeremy butter ##field claimed that , for non - linguist ##s , " grammar is often a generic way of referring to any aspect of english that people object to . " [SEP]
[CLS] in the west , grammar emerged as a discipline in hell ##eni ##sm from the 3rd century bc forward with authors like r ##hya ##nus and ari ##star ##chus of sam ##oth ##race . [SEP]
[CLS] the oldest known grammar handbook is the " art of grammar " , a su ##cci ##nc ##t guide to speaking and writing clearly and effectively , written by the ancient greek scholar dion ##ys ##ius th ##ra ##x ( 170 – 90 bc ) , a student of ari ##star ##chus of sam ##oth ##race who established a school on the greek island of rhodes . [SEP]
[CLS] dion ##ys ##ius th ##ra ##x ' s grammar book remained the primary grammar textbook for greek school ##boys until as late as the twelfth century ad . [SEP]
[CLS] the romans based their grammatical writings on it and its basic format remains the basis for grammar guides in many languages even today . [SEP]
[CLS] a grammar of irish originated in the 7th century with the aura ##ice ##pt na n - ec ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] ibn bar ##un in the 12th century compares the hebrew language with arabic in the islamic grammatical tradition . [SEP]
[CLS] belonging to the " tri ##vi ##um " of the seven liberal arts , grammar was taught as a core discipline throughout the middle ages , following the influence of authors from late antiquity , such as pri ##scia ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment of vernacular ##s began gradually during the high middle ages , with isolated works such as the first grammatical treatise , but became influential only in the renaissance and baroque periods . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 16th - century italian renaissance , the " question ##e della ling ##ua " was the discussion on the status and ideal form of the italian language , initiated by dante ' s " de vulgar ##i el ##o ##quent ##ia " ( pietro be ##mbo , " prose della volga ##r ling ##ua " venice 152 ##5 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] grammar ##s of non - european languages began to be compiled for the purposes of evan ##gel ##ization and bible translation from the 16th century onward , such as " gram ##matic ##a o arte de la len ##gua general de los ind ##ios de los rey ##nos del peru " ( 1560 ) , and a que ##chua grammar by fray domingo de santo tomas . [SEP]
[CLS] from the latter part of the 18th century , grammar came to be understood as a sub ##field of the emerging discipline of modern linguistics . [SEP]
[CLS] framework ##s of grammar , which attempt to give a precise scientific theory of the syntax rules of grammar and their function , have been developed in theoretical linguistics . [SEP]
[CLS] most mainstream framework ##s are based on the conception of an innate " universal grammar " , an idea developed by no ##am cho ##ms ##ky . [SEP]
[CLS] with the advent of written representations , formal rules about language usage tend to appear also . [SEP]
[CLS] formal grammar ##s are cod ##ification ##s of usage that are developed by repeated documentation over time , and by observation as well . [SEP]
[CLS] linguist ##s tend to view pre ##script ##ive grammar ##s as having little justification beyond their authors ' aesthetic tastes , although style guides may give useful advice about " standard language employment " , based on descriptions of usage in contemporary writings of the same language . [SEP]
[CLS] linguistic prescription ##s also form part of the explanation for variation in speech , particularly variation in the speech of an individual speaker ( an explanation , for example , for why some people say " i didn ' t do nothing " , some say " i didn ' t do anything " , and some say one or the other depending on social context ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the formal study of grammar is an important part of education for children from a young age through advanced learning , though the rules taught in schools are not a " grammar " in the sense most linguist ##s use the term , particularly as they are pre ##script ##ive in intent rather than descriptive . [SEP]
[CLS] ( both do have some in ##fle ##ctions , and have had more in the past ; thus , they are becoming even less synthetic and more " purely " analytic over time . ) [SEP]
[CLS] because latin words are quite ( though not completely ) self - contained , an intel ##li ##gible latin sentence can be made from elements that are placed in a largely arbitrary order . [SEP]
[CLS] in its earliest form , " grammar school " referred to a school that taught students to read , scan , interpret , and dec ##lai ##m greek and latin poets ( including homer , virgil , eu ##rip ##ides , and others ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these should not be confused with the related , albeit distinct , modern british grammar schools . [SEP]
[CLS] a standard language is a particular dialect of a language that is promoted above other dialects in writing , education , and broadly speaking in the public sphere ; it contrasts with vernacular dialects , which may be the objects of study in academic , descriptive linguistics but which are rarely taught pre ##script ##ively . [SEP]
[CLS] the standardized " first language " taught in primary education may be subject to political controversy , because it may sometimes establish a standard defining nationality or ethnicity . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary focus has been to prevent the use of outdated pre ##script ##ive rules in favor of laying down norms based on prior descriptive research and to change perceptions about relative " correct ##ness " of prescribed standard forms in comparison to non - standard dialects . [SEP]
[CLS] standard italian is not based on the speech of the capital , rome , but on the speech of florence because of the influence fl ##ore ##ntine ##s had on early italian literature . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , standard spanish is not based on the speech of madrid , but on that of educated speakers from more north ##erly areas like castile and leon ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] in argentina and uruguay the spanish standard is based on the local dialects of buenos aires and montevideo ( rio ##plate ##nse spanish ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the serbian variant of serb ##o - croatian is divided in a similar way ; serbia and the rep ##ub ##lika sr ##ps ##ka of bosnia and herzegovina use their own distinct norma ##tive sub ##var ##ie ##ties , with differences in ya ##t reflex ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] the existence and cod ##ification of a distinct montenegrin standard is a matter of controversy , some treat montenegrin as a separate standard le ##ct and some think it should be considered another form of serbian . [SEP]
[CLS] norwegian has two standards , " bo ##km ##al " and " ny ##nor ##sk " , the choice between which is subject to controversy : each norwegian municipality can declare one of the two its official language , or it can remain " language neutral " . [SEP]
[CLS] standard german emerged from the standardized chancel ##ler ##y use of high german in the 16th and 17th centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] until about 1800 , it was almost entirely a written language , but now it is so widely spoken that most of the former german dialects are nearly extinct . [SEP]
[CLS] standard chinese has official status as the standard spoken form of the chinese language in the people ' s republic of china ( prc ) , the republic of china ( roc ) and the republic of singapore . [SEP]
[CLS] modern standard arabic is directly based on classical arabic , the language of the qur ' an . [SEP]
