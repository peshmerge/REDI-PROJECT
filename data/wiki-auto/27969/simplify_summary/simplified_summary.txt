there are three kinds of constitutional isomers .
in the table below , the hydroxyl group can occupy three different positions on an n-pentane chain .
many aromatic isomers exist because substituents can be placed on different parts of the benzene ring .
only one isomer of phenol or hydroxybenzene exists , but cresol or methylphenol has three isomers where the additional methyl group can be placed on three different positions on the position of the hydroxyl .
functional isomers are structural isomers that have the same molecular formula _ 1 .
these groups of atoms are called functional groups , functionalities , and functional groups .
these two are considered functional group isomers because cyclohexane is a cycloalkane and 1-hexene is an alkene .
for two molecules to be functional isomers , they must contain key groups of atoms arranged in particular ways .
if the functionalities stay the same , but their locations change , the isomers are functional isomers .
the functional group performs carbon chain-o-h foley is present in both of these compounds , but they are not the same .
some chemists use the terms structural isomer and functional isomer .
functional isomers are most often identified in chemistry using infrared spectroscopy .
infrared radiation is the energy that comes from molecular vibrations .
some of the same functional groups absorb some wavelengths of infrared light .
the infrared spectrum is divided into two regions .
the first part is called the functional group area .
ether and ethanol would have dissimilar infrared spectra in the functional group region .
the second part of the infrared spectrum is called the fingerprint region .
the fingerprint region is more specific to an individual compound .
even though 1-propanol and 2-propanol have similar infrared spectra in the functional group region , they differ in the fingerprint region .
functional isomers are functional isomers that have different functional groups like alcohol and ether .
as an example of isomer counting , there are nine structural isomers with molecular formula cho having different bond connectivities .
an additional two structural isomers are the enol tautomers of the carbonyl isomersportsdehyde and acetone [mask] , but these are not stable .
