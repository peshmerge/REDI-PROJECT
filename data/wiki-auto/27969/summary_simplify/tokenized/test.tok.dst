[CLS] a structural iso ##mer , or constitutional iso ##mer ( per i ##up ##ac ) , is a type of iso ##mer in which molecules with the same molecular formula have different bonding patterns and atomic organization , as opposed to stereo ##iso ##mers , in which molecular bonds are always in the same order and only spatial arrangement differs . [SEP]
[CLS] three categories of structural iso ##mers are skeletal , position ##al , and functional iso ##mers . [SEP]
[CLS] in chain iso ##mer ##ism , or skeletal iso ##mer ##ism , components of the ( usually carbon ) skeleton are distinctly re - ordered to create different structures . [SEP]
[CLS] in the table below , the hydro ##xy ##l group can occupy three different positions on an n - pen ##tan ##e chain forming three different compounds . [SEP]
[CLS] only one iso ##mer of ph ##eno ##l or hydro ##xy ##ben ##zen ##e exists , but cr ##es ##ol or methyl ##ph ##eno ##l has three iso ##mers where the additional methyl group can be placed on three different positions on the ring relative to the position of the hydro ##xy ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] functional iso ##mers are structural iso ##mers that have the same molecular formula ( that is , the same number of atoms of the same elements ) , but the atoms are connected in different ways so that the grouping ##s are di ##ssi ##mi ##lar . [SEP]
[CLS] these two are considered functional group iso ##mers because cy ##cl ##oh ##ex ##ane is a cy ##cl ##oa ##lka ##ne and 1 - he ##x ##ene is an al ##ken ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] for two molecules to be functional iso ##mers , they must contain key groups of atoms arranged in particular ways . [SEP]
[CLS] depending on how the atoms are arranged , it can represent two different compounds dime ##thy ##l ether ch - o - ch or ethanol ch ##ch - o - h . [SEP]
[CLS] dime ##thy ##l ether and ethanol are functional iso ##mers . [SEP]
[CLS] if the functional ##ities stay the same , but their locations change , the structural iso ##mers are not functional iso ##mers . [SEP]
[CLS] the functional group ( carbon chain - o - h ) is present in both of these compounds , but they are not the same . [SEP]
[CLS] while some chemist ##s use the terms structural iso ##mer and functional iso ##mer interchange ##ably , not all structural iso ##mers are functional iso ##mers . [SEP]
[CLS] functional iso ##mers are most often identified in chemistry using infrared spectroscopy . [SEP]
[CLS] compounds with the same functional groups will all absorb certain wavelengths of infrared light because of the vibrations associated with those groups . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , the infrared spectrum is divided into two regions . [SEP]
[CLS] the first part is called the functional group region . [SEP]
[CLS] dime ##thy ##l ether and ethanol would have di ##ssi ##mi ##lar infrared spectra in the functional group region . [SEP]
[CLS] the second part of the infrared spectrum is called the finger ##print region ; it is associated with types of motion allowed by the symmetry of the molecule and influenced by the bond energies . [SEP]
[CLS] even though 1 - prop ##ano ##l and 2 - prop ##ano ##l have similar infrared spectra in the functional group region , they differ in the finger ##print region . [SEP]
[CLS] in simple terms , functional iso ##mers are structural iso ##mers that have different functional groups like alcohol and ether . [SEP]
[CLS] as an example of iso ##mer counting , there are nine structural iso ##mers with molecular formula cho having different bond connect ##iv ##ities . [SEP]
[CLS] an additional two structural iso ##mers are the en ##ol taut ##ome ##rs of the carbon ##yl iso ##mers ( prop ##ional ##deh ##yde and ace ##tone ) , but these are not stable . [SEP]
