[CLS] the metre convention , also known as the treaty of the metre , is an international treaty that was signed in paris on 20 may 1875 by representatives of 17 nations ( argentina , austria - hungary , belgium , brazil , denmark , france , germany , italy , peru , portugal , russia , spain , sweden and norway , switzerland , ottoman empire , united states of america , and venezuela ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the treaty created the international bureau of weights and measures ( bi ##pm ) , an inter ##go ##vern ##mental organization under the authority of the general conference on weights and measures ( c ##gp ##m ) and the supervision of the international committee for weights and measures ( ci ##pm ) , that coordinates international metro ##logy and the development of the metric system . [SEP]
[CLS] as well as founding the bi ##pm and laying down the way in which the activities of the bi ##pm should be financed and managed , the metre convention established a permanent organizational structure for member governments to act in common accord on all matters relating to units of measurement . [SEP]
[CLS] only states can be members as per the metre convention . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to member status , the general conference on weights and measures ( c ##gp ##m ) created in 1999 the status of associate of the c ##gp ##m open to states and economic entities to enable them to participate in some activities of the bi ##pm through their national metro ##logy institutes ( nmi ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] membership of the convention requires payment of substantial fees . [SEP]
[CLS] failure to pay these over a span of years , without any expectation of a payment agreement , has caused a number of nations such as north korea to be removed from the protocol . [SEP]
[CLS] as of 7 august 2018 , there are 60 member states and 42 associate state and economies . [SEP]
[CLS] initially the metre convention was only concerned with the units of mass and length but , in 1921 , at the 6th meeting of the general conference on weights and measures ( c ##gp ##m ) , it was revised and it extended the scope and responsibilities of the bi ##pm to other fields in physics . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1960 , at the 11th meetings of the c ##gp ##m , the system of units it had established was named the international system of units , with the abbreviation si . [SEP]
[CLS] before the french revolution , which started in 1789 , french units of measurement were based on the carol ##ing ##ian system , introduced by the first holy roman emperor charlemagne ( 800 – 81 ##4 ad ) which in turn were based on ancient roman measures . [SEP]
[CLS] charlemagne brought a consistent system of measures across the entire empire . [SEP]
[CLS] however , after his death , the empire fragmented and many rulers introduced their own variants of the units of measure . [SEP]
[CLS] some of charlemagne ' s units of measure , such as the " pie ##d du roi " ( the king ' s foot ) remained virtually unchanged for about a thousand years , while others , such as the " au ##ne " ( el ##l — used to measure cloth ) and the " liv ##re " ( pound ) varied dramatically from locality to locality . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time of the revolution , the number of units of measure had grown to the extent that it was almost impossible to keep track of them . [SEP]
[CLS] in england in 121 ##5 , clause 25 of the magna cart ##a required that the same standards of measurement be applied throughout the realm . [SEP]
[CLS] the word ##ing of the clause emphasis ##ed that " there is to be a single measure . . . throughout our realm " . [SEP]
[CLS] five centuries later , when in 1707 england and scotland were united into a single kingdom , the scots agreed to use the same units of measure that were already established in england . [SEP]
[CLS] during the eighteenth century , in order to facilitate trade , peter the great , c ##zar of russia adopted the english system of measure . [SEP]
[CLS] from 166 ##8 to 1776 the french standard of length was the to ##ise of chat ##ele ##t which was fixed outside the grand chat ##ele ##t in paris . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1735 two geo ##de ##tic standards were cal ##ib ##rated against the to ##ise of chat ##ele ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] one of them , the to ##ise of peru was used for the spanish - french geo ##des ##ic mission . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1766 the to ##ise of peru became the official standard of length in france and was renamed to ##ise of the academy ( french : " to ##ise de l ' academie " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] prof ##usion of units of measures was a practical problem of importance before the french revolution and its reform was one of the items on the agenda of national assembly . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1799 , after the re ##me ##as ##ure ##ment of the paris meridian arc ( french : " mer ##idi ##enne de france " ) between dunkirk and barcelona by del ##am ##bre and me ##chai ##n , the metre was defined as a quarter of a 10 - million ##th of the earth ci ##rc ##um ##ference or 3 " pie ##ds " ( french feet ) and 11 . 296 " li ##gne ##s " ( lines ) of the to ##ise of the academy . [SEP]
[CLS] tall ##ey ##rand , an influential leader of the assembly invited british and american participation in the establishment of a new system , but in the event , the assembly went it alone and introduced the metre and the ki ##logram which were to form the basis of the metric system , manufacturing prototypes which , in 1799 , were lodged with archives . [SEP]
[CLS] the he ##l ##vet ##ic republic adopted the metric system in 1803 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1805 a swiss immigrant ferdinand rudolph has ##sler brought copies of the french metre and ki ##logram in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1830 the congress decided to create uniform standards for length and weight in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] has ##sler was mandated to work out the new standards and proposed to adopt the metric system . [SEP]
[CLS] the united states congress opted for the british parliamentary standard from 1758 and the troy pound of great britain from 1824 as length and weight standards . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , the primary baseline of the u . s coast survey was measured in 1834 at fire island using four two - metre iron bars constructed after has ##sler ' s specification in the united kingdom and brought back in the united states in 1815 . [SEP]
[CLS] all distances measured in the u . s . national geo ##de ##tic survey were referred to the metre . [SEP]
[CLS] between 1840 and 1870 , a number of countries definitive ##ly adopted the metric system as their system of measure including france , spain , many south american republics and many of the italian and german states ( the netherlands had adopted the system in 1817 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1863 , the international postal union used grams to express permitted weights of letters . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1852 the spanish government was urged by the spanish royal academy of sciences to approve the creation of a large - scale map of spain . [SEP]
[CLS] the following year carlos ib ##ane ##z e ib ##ane ##z de ib ##ero was appointed to undertake this task . [SEP]
[CLS] all the scientific and technical material had to be created . [SEP]
[CLS] carlos ib ##ane ##z e ib ##ane ##z de ib ##ero and sa ##ave ##dra went to paris to supervise the production by br ##un ##ner of a four metres long measuring instrument which they had devised and which they later compared with bo ##rda ' s double - to ##ise n ##° ##1 which was the main reference for measuring all geo ##de ##tic bases in france and whose length was 3 . 89 ##80 ##7 ##32 metres . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1867 at the second general conference of the international association of geo ##des ##y ( german : " europa ##ische gr ##ad ##mes ##sun ##g " ) held in berlin , the question of international standard of length was discussed in order to combine the measurements made in different countries to determine the size and shape of the earth . [SEP]
[CLS] the conference recommended the adoption of the metric system ( replacing be ##ssel ' s to ##ise , a copy of the to ##ise of peru made in 1823 ) and the creation of an international metre commission . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1860s , inspections of the prototype metre revealed wear and tear at the measuring faces of the bar and also that the bar was won ##t to flex slightly when in use . [SEP]
[CLS] in view of the doubts being cast on the rep ##rod ##uc ##ibility of the metre and the ki ##logram and the threat that a rival standard might be set up , napoleon iii invited scientists from all the world ' s nations to attend a conference in paris . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 1870 , two weeks before the conference was due to start , the franco - prussian war broke out . [SEP]
[CLS] although the delegates did meet ( without a german delegation ) , it was agreed that the conference should be recalled once all the delegates ( including the german delegation ) were present . [SEP]
[CLS] the international metre commission was established in paris . [SEP]
[CLS] following the war , which resulted in napoleon iii ' s exile , germany and italy , now unified nations , adopted the metric system as their national system of units , but with the prototype copy of the ki ##logram and metre under the control of the third french republic . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1872 the new republican government reissued the invitations and in 1875 scientists from thirty european and american countries met in paris . [SEP]
[CLS] this same year , the international association of geo ##des ##y held its general conference in paris and decided the creation of an international geo ##de ##tic standard for baseline ##s ' measurement cal ##ib ##rated against the metre . [SEP]
[CLS] the principal tasks facing the delegates at the 1875 conference was the replacement of the existing metre and ki ##logram artefacts that were held by the french government and the setting up of an organisation to administer the maintenance of standards around the globe . [SEP]
[CLS] the conference did not concern itself with other units of measure . [SEP]
[CLS] the conference had under ##tones of franco - german political man ##oe ##u ##vr ##ing , particularly since the french had been humiliated by the prussian ##s during the war a few years previously . [SEP]
[CLS] although france lost control of the metric system , they ensured that it passed to international rather than german control and that the international headquarters were located in paris . [SEP]
[CLS] spain notably supported france for this outcome and the first president of the international committee for weights and measures , the spanish geo ##des ##ist , carlos ib ##ane ##z e ib ##ane ##z de ib ##ero received the grand officer medal of the legion d ' honneur for his diplomatic role on this issue and was awarded the ponce ##let prize for his scientific contribution to metro ##logy . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , as carlos ib ##ane ##z e ib ##ane ##z de ib ##ero was collaborating with the french on the paris meridian arc ( west europe - africa meridian - arc ) re ##me ##as ##ure ##ment since 1853 , and was president of both the permanent committee of the international metre commission since 1872 and the permanent commission of the international association of geo ##des ##y since 1874 , he was to play a pivotal role in rec ##on ##ci ##ling french and german interests . [SEP]
[CLS] the conference was called to discuss the maintenance of international standards based on the existing french standards rather than using french standards which , at that time , were 70 years old and which , through wear and tear , might not be exactly the same as when they adopted in 1799 . [SEP]
[CLS] prior to the 1870 conference , french politicians had feared that the world community might reject the existing metre as it was 0 . 03 % ( 300 μ ##m ) shorter than its design length , ordering a new mer ##idi ##onal measurement . [SEP]
[CLS] they were eventually reassured when the german - born swiss delegate adolph ##e hirsch said " no serious scientist would in our day and age con ##tem ##plate a metre de ##duced from the size of the earth " . [SEP]
[CLS] when the conference was rec ##on ##ven ##ed in 1875 , it was proposed that new prototype metre and ki ##logram standards be manufactured to reproduce the values of the existing artifacts as closely as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] although the new standard metre had the same value as the old metre , it had an " x " cross - section rather than a rectangular cross - section as this reduced the flex ##ing when taking measurements . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , the new bar , rather than being exactly one metre in length was a little longer than one metre and had lines engraved on them that were exactly one metre apart . [SEP]
[CLS] the london firm johnson matt ##hey delivered 30 prototype metres and 40 prototype kilograms . [SEP]
[CLS] at the first meeting of the c ##gp ##m in 1889 bar no . 6 and cylinder no . [SEP]
[CLS] x were chosen by lot as the international prototypes . [SEP]
[CLS] the remainder were either kept as bi ##pm working copies or distributed by lot to member states as national prototypes . [SEP]
[CLS] the prototype metre was retained as the international standard until 1960 when the metre was red ##efined in terms of the wavelength of the orange - red line of k ##ry ##pton - 86 . [SEP]
[CLS] the current definition of the metre is : " " the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1 / 299 ##7 ##9 ##24 ##58 of a second " " . [SEP]
[CLS] on 16 november 2018 , the 26th general conference on weights and measures ( c ##gp ##m ) voted unanimously in favour of revised definitions of some si base units , in particular the ki ##logram . [SEP]
[CLS] the new definitions came into force on 20 may 2019 , but do not change the metre . [SEP]
[CLS] the convention created an international organization with three organs to facilitate the standard ##isation of weights and measures around the world . [SEP]
[CLS] the first , the c ##gp ##m provides a forum for representative of member states , the second , the ci ##pm is an advisory committee of metro ##logists of high standing and the third , the bi ##pm is an institute that provides appropriate secret ##aria ##l and laboratory facilities in support of the c ##gp ##m and ci ##pm . [SEP]
[CLS] the structure may be compared to a corporation . [SEP]
[CLS] the ci ##pm is the board of directors , and the c ##gp ##m is the shareholders ' meeting . [SEP]
[CLS] the general conference on weights and measures ( " conference general ##e des po ##ids et me ##sure ##s " or c ##gp ##m ) is the principal decision - making body put on place by the convention . [SEP]
[CLS] it is made up of delegates from member states and non - voting observers from associate states and economies . [SEP]
[CLS] the conference usually meets every four years to receive and discuss a report from the ci ##pm and to end ##ors ##e new developments in the si on the advice of the ci ##pm though at the 2011 meeting , it agreed to meet again in 2014 rather than 2015 to discuss the maturity of the new si proposals . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also responsible for new appointments to the ci ##pm and decides on major issues concerning the development and financing of the bi ##pm . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the metre convention ( art . 4 ) the president of the french academy of sciences is also the president of the general conference on weights and measures . [SEP]
[CLS] the international committee for weights and measures ( " com ##ite international des po ##ids et me ##sure ##s " or ci ##pm ) is made up of eighteen ( originally fourteen ) individuals from a member state of high scientific standing , nominated by the c ##gp ##m to advise the c ##gp ##m on administrative and technical matters . [SEP]
[CLS] it is responsible for the running of ten consultative committees ( cc ##s ) , each of which investigates different aspects of metro ##logy – one cc discusses the measurement of temperature , another the measurement of mass and so on . [SEP]
[CLS] the ci ##pm meets annually at se ##vres to discuss annual reports from the various cc ##s , to submit an annual report to the governments of member states in respect of the administration and finances of the bi ##pm and to advise the c ##gp ##m on technical matters as and when necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] each member of the ci ##pm is from a different member state – with france , in recognition of its work in setting up the convention , always having one seat on the ci ##pm . [SEP]
[CLS] the international bureau of weights and measures ( " bureau international des po ##ids et me ##sure ##s " or bi ##pm ) is an organisation based at se ##vres , france that has custody of the now historical international prototype ki ##logram , provides metro ##logy services for the c ##gp ##m and ci ##pm , houses the secretariat for these organisations and hosts their formal meetings . [SEP]
[CLS] it also has custody of the former international prototype metre which was retired in 1960 . [SEP]
[CLS] over the years the various international prototype metres and kilograms were returned to bi ##pm headquarters for rec ##ali ##bra ##tion services . [SEP]
[CLS] initially it had a staff of 9 , falling to 4 once the initial batch of prototypes had been distributed ; in 2012 it had a staff of over 70 people and an annual budget of over € ##10 million . [SEP]
[CLS] the director of the bi ##pm is " ex - off ##icio " a member of the ci ##pm and a member of all consultative committees . [SEP]
[CLS] the original treaty was written in french and the authoritative language of all official documents is french . [SEP]
[CLS] communication between the bi ##pm and member states is , in the case of france , via the french foreign minister and in the case of all other members , via the members ' ambassador to france . [SEP]
[CLS] the french government offered the treaty members the pa ##vill ##on de bret ##eu ##il in se ##vres to house the bi ##pm . [SEP]
[CLS] the pa ##vill ##on was originally built in 1675 on the estate of the chateau de saint - cloud and was home to , amongst others , emperor napoleon iii . [SEP]
[CLS] the chateau was all but destroyed during the franco - prussian war ( 1870 – 1 ) and the pa ##vill ##on badly damaged . [SEP]
[CLS] the pa ##vill ##on has been fully restored and , as headquarters of an inter ##go ##vern ##mental organization enjoys privileges and im ##mun ##ities similar to those of em ##bas ##sies . [SEP]
[CLS] the science of metro ##logy has progressed vastly since 1875 . [SEP]
[CLS] in particular the treaty was amended in 1921 with the result that many other international organisations have a forum within the ci ##pm to ensure harmon ##isation of measurement standards across many disciplines . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , what were originally conceived as standards for the purposes of trade have now been extended to cover a large number of aspects of human activity including medicine , science , engineering and technology . [SEP]
[CLS] the metre convention was originally drawn up with the main purpose of providing a standards of length and mass only . [SEP]
[CLS] standards relating to other quantities were under the control of other bodies – time was measured by astronomers , electrical units by a series of ad - hoc international conferences , and other physical standards and concepts were maintained or defined by international bodies such as international congress of applied chemistry or the international union of pure and applied physics . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1901 gi ##org ##i published a proposal for building a coherent set of units based on four base units – the metre , ki ##logram , second and one electrical unit ( amp ##ere , vol ##t or oh ##m ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1921 the convention was extended to permit the promotion of standards relating to any physical quantity which greatly increased the scope of the ci ##pm ' s re ##mit and implicit ##ly giving it freedom to exploit gi ##org ##i ' s proposals . [SEP]
[CLS] the 8th c ##gp ##m ( 1933 ) resolved to work with other international bodies to agree standards for electrical units that could be related back to the international prototypes . [SEP]
[CLS] this was agreed in principle by the international electro ##tech ##nical commission at its congress in brussels in 1935 subject to the choice of the fourth unit being agreed with , amongst others , the appropriate consultative committee of the ci ##pm . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1948 , three years after the end of the second world war and fifteen years after the 8th c ##gp ##m , the 9th c ##gp ##m was convened . [SEP]
[CLS] in response to formal requests made by the international union of pure and applied physics and by the french government to establish a practical system of units of measure , the c ##gp ##m requested the ci ##pm to prepare recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement , suitable for adoption by all countries ad ##hering to the metre convention . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time the c ##gp ##m formally adopted a recommendation for the writing and printing of unit symbols and of numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] the recommendation also catalogue ##d the recommended symbols for the most important mk ##s and c ##gs units of measure and for the first time the c ##gp ##m made recommendations concerning derived units . [SEP]
[CLS] the ci ##pm ' s draft proposal , which was an extensive revision and sim ##pl ##ification of the metric unit definitions , symbols and terminology based on the mk ##s system of units , was put to the 10th c ##gp ##m in 1954 . [SEP]
[CLS] in the proposal the ci ##pm recommended that the amp ##ere be the base unit from which electro ##me ##chan ##ical standards would be derived . [SEP]
[CLS] after negotiations with the cis and i ##up ##ap , two further base units , the degree kelvin and the can ##del ##a were also proposed as base units . [SEP]
[CLS] the full system and name " system ##e international d ' unite ##s " were adopted at the 11th c ##gp ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] during the years that followed the definitions of the base units and particularly the " mis ##e en pr ##ati ##que " to realise these definitions have been refined . [SEP]
[CLS] the formal definition of international system of units ( si ) along with the associated resolutions passed by the c ##gp ##m and the ci ##pm are published by the bi ##pm on the internet and in bro ##chu ##re form at regular intervals . [SEP]
[CLS] the eighth edition of the bro ##chu ##re " le system ##e international d ' unite ##s – the international system of units " was published in 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1940s , the united states government recognised the benefits of its suppliers keeping quality control records in respect of manufactured goods that would provide trace ##ability of the process . [SEP]
[CLS] this process was formal ##ised by the british government and in 1979 as the quality control standard bs 57 ##50 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1987 bs 57 ##50 was adopted by iso as the basis for iso 900 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] iso 900 ##0 is a general purpose quality control standard which works in conjunction industry - specific standards : for example iso 151 ##9 ##5 : 2003 which gives the specific requirements for reference measurement laboratories in laboratory medicine . [SEP]
[CLS] international trade is hampered by one country not rec ##og ##nis ##ing the quality controls in place in other countries – often due to standards being different or being incompatible with each other . [SEP]
[CLS] at the 20th c ##gp ##m ( 1995 ) , it was recognised that although ad - hoc recognition of instrument cal ##ib ##ration between cooper ##ating countries had been taking place for a hundred years , a need had arise ##n for a more comprehensive agreement . [SEP]
[CLS] consequently , the ci ##pm was mandated to investigate the setting up of a mutual recognition agreement in respect of instrument cal ##ib ##ration . [SEP]
[CLS] any such agreement would require the keeping of records that could demonstrate the trace ##ability of cal ##ib ##rations back to the base standards . [SEP]
[CLS] such records would be recorded within an iso 900 ##0 framework . [SEP]
[CLS] four years later , in 1999 the text of the ci ##pm - mr ##a was agreed at the 21st c ##gp ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] the ci ##pm - mr ##a scheme is to catalogue the capabilities of national measurement institutes ( nmi ##s ) such as ni ##st in the united states or the national physical laboratory in the united kingdom whose cal ##ib ##ration procedures have been peer - assessed . [SEP]
[CLS] subsequent to launch of the ci ##pm mr ##a and in response to a european community directive on " in vitro " medical devices , the joint committee for trace ##ability in laboratory medicine ( jc ##tl ##m ) was created in 2002 through a declaration of cooperation between the international committee of weights and measures ( ci ##pm ) , the international federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine ( if ##cc ) , and the international laboratory accreditation cooperation ( il ##ac ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the joint committee provides a forum for the harmon ##isation of standards of the various participants . [SEP]
[CLS] with the advent of the atomic clock it has been possible to define and measure international atomic time with sufficient precision that variations in the earth ' s rotation can be detected . [SEP]
[CLS] the international earth rotation service monitors these changes relative to the stars at regular intervals and proposes leap seconds as and when these are needed . [SEP]
[CLS] currently there are over 200 atomic clocks in over 50 national laboratories around the world and the bi ##pm , in terms of the mandate given to it under the metre convention , coordinates the various atomic clocks . [SEP]
[CLS] since 1960 , when the definition of the metre was linked to a particular wavelength of light rather than the international prototype metre , the only unit of measure that remained dependent on a particular arte ##fa ##ct was the ki ##logram . [SEP]
[CLS] over the years , small drift ##s which could be as high as kilograms per annum in the mass of the international prototype ki ##logram have been detected . [SEP]
[CLS] at the 21st meeting of the c ##gp ##m ( 1999 ) , national laboratories were urged to investigate ways of breaking the link between the ki ##logram and a specific arte ##fa ##ct . [SEP]
[CLS] independently of this drift having been identified , the av ##oga ##dro project and development of the ki ##bble ( or watt ) balance promised methods of indirectly measuring mass with a very high precision . [SEP]
[CLS] these projects provided tools that would enable alternative means of red ##ef ##ining the ki ##logram . [SEP]
[CLS] a report published in 2007 by the consultative committee for the ##rm ##ome ##try to the ci ##pm noted that their current definition of temperature has proved to be un ##sat ##is ##factory for temperatures below 20 k and for temperatures above 1300 k . [SEP]
[CLS] the committee was of the view that the bolt ##zman ##n constant provided a better basis for temperature measurement than did the triple point of water , as it overcame these difficulties . [SEP]
[CLS] over the next few years the support for natural constant ##s grew and details were clarified , until in november 2018 , the 26th general conference on weights and measures voted unanimously in favour of revised definitions of the si base units . [SEP]
[CLS] the 2019 red ##ef ##ini ##tion of the si base units came into force on the 144 ##th anniversary of the convention , 20 may 2019 . [SEP]
[CLS] the c ##gp ##m recognise ##s two classes of membership – full membership for those states that wish to participate in the activities of the bi ##pm and associate membership for those countries or economies that only wish to participate in the mr ##a programme . [SEP]
[CLS] associate members have observer status at the c ##gp ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] since all formal liaison between the convention organisations and national governments is handled by the member state ' s ambassador to france , it is implicit that member states must have diplomatic relations with france , though during both world wars , nations that were at war with france retained their membership of the c ##gp ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] the opening session of each c ##gp ##m is chaired by the french foreign minister and subsequent sessions by the president de l ' academie des sciences de paris . [SEP]
[CLS] on 20 may 1875 representatives from seventeen of countries that attended the conference of the metre in 1875 , signed the convention of the metre . [SEP]
[CLS] in april 1884 h ##j chan ##ey , warden of standards in london unofficially contacted the bi ##pm in ##qui ##ring whether the bi ##pm would cal ##ib ##rate some metre standards that had been manufactured in the united kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] bro ##ch , director of the bi ##pm replied that he was not authorised to perform any such cal ##ib ##rations for non - member states . [SEP]
[CLS] on 17 september 1884 , the british government signed the convention on behalf of the united kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] this number grew to 21 in 1900 , 32 in 1950 , and 49 in 2001 . [SEP]
[CLS] at its 21st meeting ( october 1999 ) , the c ##gp ##m created the category of " associate " for those states not yet members of the bi ##pm and for economic unions . [SEP]
[CLS] north korea ( 1982 or 1989 – 2012 ) [SEP]
[CLS] yemen was an associate since 21 july 2014 until 1 january 2018 [SEP]
