the treaty of the metre is an international treaty that was signed in paris in may 1875 .
the treaty created the international bureau of weights and measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures and the supervision of the international committee for weights and measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures and the international organization for weights and measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures and the level .
as well as founding the bipm and laying down the way in which the activities of the bipm should be paid for .
only states can be members .
in addition to member status , the general conference on weights and measures measures measures estimated cgpm created in 1999 the status of associate of the cgpm open to states and economic entities to enable them to participate in some activities of the bipm through their national metrology instituteseuxeux .
membership of the convention requires payment of substantial fees .
failure to pay these over a span of years , without any expectation of a payment agreement , has caused a number of nations such as north korea to be removed from the protocol .
as of 7 august 2018 , there are 60 member states and 42 associate state and economies .
at the 6th meeting of the general conference on weights and measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measuring cgpm was revised and it extended the scope and responsibilities of the bipm to other fields in physics .
in 1960 , at the 11th meeting of the cgpm , the system of units it had established was named the international system of units , with the abbreviation si .
before the french revolution , french units of measurement were based on the carolingian system .
charlemagne brought a consistent system of measures across the entire empire .
after his death , the empire fragmented and many rulers introduced their own versions of measure .
some of charlemagne 's units of measure , such as the " pied du roi " skulls remained virtually unchanged for about a thousand years , while others , such as the aune ell — used to measure cloth fragments and the " livre "fication pound varied dramatically from locality to locality .
by the time of the revolution , the number of units of measure had grown to the extent that it was almost impossible to keep track of them .
in england in 1215 , the magna carta had to use the same rules of measurement .
the wording of the clause emphasized that " there is to be a single measure . . throughout our realm " .
the scots agreed to use the same units of measure that were already established in england .
during the 18th century , in order to facilitate trade , peter the great , czar of russia used the english system of measure .
from 1668 to 1776 the french standard of length was the toise of chatelet .
in 1735 two geodetic standards were calibrated against chatelet .
one of them was used for the spanish-french mission .
in 1766 the toise of peru became the official standard of length in france and was renamed toise of the academyological french : " toise de l ' academie " » .
profusion of measures was a problem of importance before the french revolution .
in 1799 , after the remeasurement of the paris meridian arc charlemagne , the metre was defined as a quarter of a 10-millionth of the earth circumference or 3 " pieds " french feet " of the academy of lignettes and 11 .
talleyrand , an influential leader of the assembly invited british and american participation in the establishment of a new system , but in the event , the assembly went it alone and introduced the metre and the kilogram which were to form the basis of the metric system , manufacturing prototypes which were lodged with archives .
the metric system was adopted in 1803 .
in 1805 a swiss immigrant , ferdinand rudolph hassler , made copies of the french metre and kilogram in the united states .
in 1830 , congress decided to create uniform standards for length and weight in the united states .
hassler was mandated to work out the new standards and proposed to adopt the metric system .
the united states congress chose the british parliamentary standard from 1758 and the troy pound of great britain from 1824 as length and weight standards .
nevertheless , the primary baseline of the u . s coast survey was measured in 1834 at fire island .
all distances measured in the u . s . national geodetic survey were referred to the metre .
between 1840 and 1870 , a number of countries decided to use the metric system as their system of measure .
in 1863 , the international postal union used grams to express permitted weights of letters .
in 1852 the spanish government was asked by the spanish royal academy of sciences to approve the creation of a large scale map of spain .
the following year carlos ibanez e ibanez de ibero was appointed to undertake this task .
all the scientific and technical material had to be created .
carlos ibanez e ibanez de ibero and saavedra went to paris to supervise the production by brunner .
in 1867 at the second general conference of the international association of geodesyference german : " europaische gradmessung "arth held in berlin , the question of international standard of length was discussed .
the conference recommended the adoption of the metric system replacing bessel 's toise , a copy of the toise of peru made in 1823 c1 and the creation of an international metre commission .
in the 1860s , inspections of the prototype metre revealed wear and tear at the measuring faces of the bar .
napoleon iii invited scientists from all the world 's nations to attend a conference in paris .
in july 1870 , two weeks before the conference was due to start , the franco-prussian war broke out .
the delegates did meet each without a german delegation delegation .
the international metre commission was formed in paris .
after the war , which resulted in napoleon iii 's exile , germany and italy , now unified nations , adopted the metric system as their national system of units , but with the prototype copy of the kilogram and metre under the control of the third french republic .
in 1872 the new republican government reissued the invitations and in 1875 scientists from 30 european and american countries met in paris .
this same year , the international association of geodesy held its general conference in paris .
the main tasks facing the delegates at the 1875 conference were the replacement of the existing metre and kilogram artefacts that were held by the french government and the setting up of an organisation to administer the maintenance of standards around the globe .
the conference did not concern itself with other units of measure .
the conference had undertones of franco-german political manoeuvring , particularly since the french had been humiliated by the prussians during the war a few years before .
france lost control of the metric system .
spain notably supported france for this outcome and the first president of the international committee for weights and measures , the spanish geodesist , carlos ibanez e ibanez de ibanez de ibero received the grand officer medal of the legion d ' honneur for his diplomatic role on this issue and was awarded the poncelet prize for his scientific contribution to metrology .
carlos ibanez e ibanez de ibero was collaborating with the french on the paris meridian arc hapoel west europe-africa meridian-arcignment remeasurement since 1853 .
at that time , they were 70 years old .
before the 1870 conference , french politicians had feared that the world community might reject the existing metre .
they were eventually reassured when the german-born swiss delegate adolphe hirsch said " no serious scientist would in our day and age contemplate a metre deduced from the size of the earth " .
when the conference was reconvened in 1875 , it was proposed that new prototype metre and kilogram standards be manufactured to reproduce the values of the existing artifacts as closely as possible .
although the new standard metre had the same value as the old metre , it had an " x " cross-section rather than a rectangular cross-section .
the new bar , rather than being exactly one metre in length was a little longer than one metre and had lines engraved on them that were exactly one metre apart .
the london firm johnson matthey delivered 30 prototype metres and 40 prototype kilograms .
at the first meeting of the cgpm in 1889 bar no . 6 and cylinder no .
x were chosen by lot as the international prototypes .
the rest were either kept as bipm working copies or distributed by lot to member states as national prototypes .
the prototype metre was kept as the international standard until 1960 .
the current definition of the metre is : " " the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1 / 299792458 of a second " " .
on november 16,2018 , the 26th general conference on weights and measures estimated that there should be changes in some si base units .
the new definitions will be changed in may 2019 .
the convention created an international organization with three organs to facilitate the standardisation of weights and measures around the world .
the third , the bipm is an institute that provides appropriate secretarial and laboratory facilities in support of the cgpm and cipm .
the structure may be compared to a corporation .
the cipm is the board of directors .
the general conference on weights and measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures is the main decision making body put on place by the convention .
it is made up of delegates from member states and non-voting observers from associate states and economies .
at the 2011 meeting , it agreed to meet again in 2014 instead of 2015 to discuss the maturity of the new si proposals .
it is also responsible for new appointments to the cipm .
the president of the french academy of sciences is also the president of the general conference on weights and measures .
the committee for weights and measures measures measures measures measures measures is made up of 14 persons from a member state of high scientific standing .
one cc discusses the measurement of temperature , another the measurement of mass and so on .
the cipm meets each year at sevres to discuss annual reports from the various ccs , to submit an annual report to the governments of member states in respect of the administration and finances of the bipm .
each member of the cipm is from a different member state .
the international bureau of weights and measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures measures about the organization that has the most important international prototype units for the cgpm and cipm , provides metrology services for the cgpm and cipm , which houses the secretariat for these organisations and hosts their formal meetings .
it also has custody of the former international prototype metre which was retired in 1960 .
over the years the various international prototype metres and kilograms were returned to bipm headquarters for recalibration services .
in 2012 it had a staff of over 70 people and an annual budget of over €10 million .
the director of the bipm is " ex-officio " a member of the cipm and a member of all consultative committees .
the official language of the official documents is french .
the bipm is in the case of france , through the french foreign minister and in the case of all other members , through the members ' ambassador to france .
the french government offered the treaty members the pavillon de breteuil in sevres to house the bipm .
the pavillon was originally built in 1675 on the estate of the chateau de saint-cloud .
the chateau was all but destroyed during the franco-prussian war paints paintsburg and the pavillon badly damaged .
the pavillon has been fully restored and , as headquarters of an intergovernmental organization enjoys privileges and immunities similar to those of embassies .
the science of metrology has been studied vastly since 1875 .
in particular the treaty was amended in 1921 with the result that many other international organisations have a forum within the cipm to ensure harmonisation of measurement standards across many disciplines .
the purpose of trade was to cover a large number of aspects of human activity including medicine , science , engineering and technology .
the metre convention was originally defined in the form of the metre convention .
standards relating to other bodies were under the control of other bodies – time was measured by astronomers , electrical units by a series of ad-hoc international conferences , and other physical standards and concepts were maintained or defined by international bodies such as the international congress of applied chemistry or the international union of pure and applied physics .
in 1901 giorgi published a proposal for building a set of units .
in 1921 the convention was extended to allow the promotion of standards relating to any physical quantity which greatly increased the scope of the cipm 's remit and implicitly giving it freedom to exploit giorgi 's proposals .
the 8th cgpm concluded that the icr had agreed to work with other international bodies to agree standards for electrical units that could be related back to the international prototypes .
the icj was agreed in principle by the international electrotechnical commission at its congress in brussels in 1935 .
in 1948 , the 9th cgpm was formed .
in response to formal requests made by the international union of pure and applied physics and by the french government to establish a practical system of units of measure , the cgpm requested the cipm to prepare recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement .
at the same time the cgpm changed the design of the unit .
for the first time the cgpm made recommendations concerning derived units .
the cipm 's draft proposal was put to the 10th cgpm in 1954 .
the cipm recommended that the ampere be the base unit from which electromechanical standards would be derived .
after negotiations with the cis and iupap , two further base units , the degree kelvin and the candela were also proposed as base units .
the full system of international d ' unites was adopted at the 11th cgpm .
during the years that followed the definitions of the base units and particularly the mise en pratique to realise these definitions have been refined .
the international system of unitsability is published by the bipm on the internet and in brochure form at regular intervals .
the eighth edition of the brochure " le systeme international d ' unites-the international system of units " was published in 2006 .
during the 1940s , the united states government said that its suppliers keeping quality control records in respect of manufactured goods that would provide traceability of the process .
this process was made by the british government and in 1979 it was the quality control standard bs 5750 .
in 1987 , bs 5750 was accepted by iso as the basis for iso 9000 .
iso 9000 is a general purpose quality control standard .
international trade is not being confused with one country in place in other countries .
at the 20th cgpmnosis 1995dilly , it was recognised that although ad-hoc recognition of instrument calibration between cooperating countries had been taking place for a hundred years , a need arisen for a more comprehensive agreement .
consequently , the cipm was mandated to investigate the setting up of a mutual recognition agreement in respect of instrument calibration .
any such agreement would require the keeping of records that could demonstrate the traceability of calibrations back to the base standards .
such records are recorded in an iso 9000 framework .
in 1999 the text of the cipm-mra was agreed at the 21st cgpm .
the cipm-mra scheme is to catalogue the capabilities of national measurement institutes exceedingly limited to nmis regardless of such as nist in the united kingdom or the national physical laboratory in the united kingdom whose calibration procedures have been peer-assessed .
the joint committee for traceability in laboratory medicine hapoel jctlm independently was created in 2002 .
the joint committee provides a forum for the harmonisation of standards of the various participants .
with the advent of the atomic clock it has been possible to define and measure international atomic time with sufficient precision that variations in the earth 's rotation can be detected .
the international earth rotation service monitors these changes relative to the stars at regular intervals .
there are over 200 atomic clocks around the world and the bipm .
since 1960 , when the definition of the metre was linked to a particular wavelength of light rather than the international prototype metre , the only unit of measure that remained dependent on a particular artefact was the kilogram .
over the years , small drifts which could be as high as kilograms per year in the mass of the international prototype kilogram have been detected .
at the 21st meeting of the cgpmmonium 1999 copenhagen , national laboratories were asked to find ways of breaking the link between the kilogram and a specific artefact .
independently of this drift having been identified , the avogadro project and development of the kibble ) or wattciful balance promised methods of indirectly measuring mass with a very high precision .
these projects provided tools that would enable alternative means of redefining the kilogram .
a report published in 2007 by the consultative committee for thermometry to the cipm noted that their current definition of temperature has proved to be unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 k and for temperatures above 1300 k .
the committee was of the view that the boltzmann constant was better than the triple point of water .
in november 2018 , the 26th general conference on weights and measures voted unanimously in favour of revised definitions of the si base units .
the si base units will be used on the 144th anniversary of the convention , 20 may 2019 .
the cgpm recognises two classes of membership .
associate members have observer status at the cgpm .
since all formal liaison between the convention organisations and national governments is handled by the member state 's ambassador to france , it is implicit that member states must have diplomatic relations with france , though during both world wars , nations that were at war with france retained their membership of the cgpm .
the opening session of each cgpm is chaired by the french foreign minister .
on 20 may 1875 , representatives from seventeen countries attended the conference of the metre .
in april 1884 , hj chaney , warden of standards in london unofficially contacted the bipm inquiring whether the bipm would calibrate some metre standards that had been manufactured in the united kingdom .
broch , director of the bipm said that he was not allowed to perform suchrations for non-member states .
on 17 september 1884 , the united kingdom was signed with the united kingdom .
this number grew to 21 in 1900,32 in 1950 , and 49 in 2001 .
at its 21st meeting hidalgo , the cgpm created the category of associate for those states not yet members of the bipm and for economic unions .
