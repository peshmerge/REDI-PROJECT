[CLS] the battle of stalin ##grad ( 23 august 1942 – 2 february 1943 ) was the largest confrontation of world war ii , in which germany and its allies fought the soviet union for control of the city of stalin ##grad ( now vol ##go ##grad ) in southern russia . [SEP]
[CLS] marked by fierce close quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians in air raids , it was the largest ( nearly 2 . 2 million personnel ) and blood ##iest ( 1 . 8 – 2 million killed , wounded or captured ) battle in the history of warfare . [SEP]
[CLS] after their defeat at stalin ##grad , the german high command had to withdraw vast military forces from the western front to replace their losses . [SEP]
[CLS] the german offensive to capture stalin ##grad began in august 1942 , using the 6th army and elements of the 4th panzer army . [SEP]
[CLS] the attack was supported by intense " luftwaffe " bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble . [SEP]
[CLS] the fighting de ##gen ##erated into house - to - house fighting ; both sides poured reinforcements into the city . [SEP]
[CLS] by mid - november 1942 , the germans had pushed the soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the volga river . [SEP]
[CLS] on 19 november 1942 , the red army launched operation " ur ##anus " , a two - pro ##nged attack targeting the weaker romanian and hungarian armies protecting the german 6th army ' s flanks . [SEP]
[CLS] the axis forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th army was cut off and surrounded in the stalin ##grad area . [SEP]
[CLS] adolf hitler ordered that the army stay in stalin ##grad and make no attempt to break out ; instead , attempts were made to supply the army by air and to break the en ##ci ##rcle ##ment from the outside . [SEP]
[CLS] heavy fighting continued for another two months . [SEP]
[CLS] by the beginning of february 1943 , the axis forces in stalin ##grad had exhausted their ammunition and food . [SEP]
[CLS] the remaining units of the 6th army surrendered . [SEP]
[CLS] the battle lasted five months , one week and three days . [SEP]
[CLS] by the spring of 1942 , despite the failure of operation " bar ##bar ##ossa " to decisive ##ly defeat the soviet union in a single campaign , the wehrmacht had captured vast expanse ##s of territory , including ukraine , belarus , and the baltic republics . [SEP]
[CLS] elsewhere , the war had been progressing well : the u - boat offensive in the atlantic had been very successful and erwin rom ##mel had just captured to ##br ##uk . [SEP]
[CLS] in the east , they had stabilized their front in a line running from leningrad in the north to ro ##stov in the south . [SEP]
[CLS] there were a number of sal ##ient ##s , but these were not particularly threatening . [SEP]
[CLS] hitler was confident that he could master the red army after the winter of 1942 , because even though army group centre ( " hee ##res ##gr ##uppe mit ##te " ) had suffered heavy losses west of moscow the previous winter , 65 % of its infantry had not been engaged and had been rested and re - equipped . [SEP]
[CLS] neither army group north nor army group south had been particularly hard pressed over the winter . [SEP]
[CLS] stalin was expecting the main thrust of the german summer attacks to be directed against moscow again . [SEP]
[CLS] with the initial operations being very successful , the germans decided that their summer campaign in 1942 would be directed at the southern parts of the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial objectives in the region around stalin ##grad were the destruction of the industrial capacity of the city and the deployment of forces to block the volga river . [SEP]
[CLS] the river was a key route from the caucasus and the caspian sea to central russia . [SEP]
[CLS] its capture would disrupt commercial river traffic . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans cut the pipeline from the oil ##fields when they captured ro ##stov on 23 july . [SEP]
[CLS] the capture of stalin ##grad would make the delivery of lend lease supplies via the persian corridor much more difficult . [SEP]
[CLS] on 23 july 1942 , hitler personally re ##wr ##ote the operational objectives for the 1942 campaign , greatly expanding them to include the occupation of the city of stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] both sides began to attach propaganda value to the city , based on it bearing the name of the leader of the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] hitler proclaimed that after stalin ##grad ' s capture , its male citizens were to be killed and all women and children were to be deported because its population was " thoroughly communist ##ic " and " especially dangerous " . [SEP]
[CLS] it was assumed that the fall of the city would also firmly secure the northern and western flanks of the german armies as they advanced on baku , with the aim of securing these strategic petroleum resources for germany . [SEP]
[CLS] the expansion of objectives was a significant factor in germany ' s failure at stalin ##grad , caused by german over ##con ##fide ##nce and an under ##est ##ima ##tion of soviet reserves . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets realized that they were pressed for time and resources . [SEP]
[CLS] they ordered that anyone strong enough to hold a rifle be sent to fight . [SEP]
[CLS] army group south was selected for a sprint forward through the southern russian steppe ##s into the caucasus to capture the vital soviet oil fields there . [SEP]
[CLS] the planned summer offensive , code - named " fall b ##lau " ( case blue ) , was to include the german 6th , 17th , 4th panzer and 1st panzer armies . [SEP]
[CLS] army group south had overrun the ukrainian soviet socialist republic in 1941 . [SEP]
[CLS] poised in eastern ukraine , it was to spear ##head the offensive . [SEP]
[CLS] hitler intervened , however , ordering the army group to split in two . [SEP]
[CLS] army group south ( a ) , under the command of wilhelm list , was to continue advancing south towards the caucasus as planned with the 17th army and first panzer army . [SEP]
[CLS] army group south ( b ) , including friedrich paul ##us ' s 6th army and hermann hot ##h ' s 4th panzer army , was to move east towards the volga and stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] army group b was commanded initially by field marshal fed ##or von bo ##ck and later by general maximilian von wei ##chs . [SEP]
[CLS] the start of " case blue " had been planned for late may 1942 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a number of german and romanian units that were to take part in " b ##lau " were be ##sie ##ging se ##vas ##top ##ol on the crimean peninsula . [SEP]
[CLS] delays in ending the siege pushed back the start date for " b ##lau " several times , and the city did not fall until early july . [SEP]
[CLS] operation fr ##ider ##icus i by the germans against the " is ##ium bulge " , pinched off the soviet sal ##ient in the second battle of k ##har ##kov , and resulted in the en ##vel ##op ##ment of a large soviet force between 17 may and 29 may . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , operation wilhelm attacked vol ##ts ##han ##sk on 13 june , and operation fr ##ider ##icus attacked ku ##pia ##nsk on 22 june . [SEP]
[CLS] " b ##lau " finally opened as army group south began its attack into southern russia on 28 june 1942 . [SEP]
[CLS] the german offensive started well . [SEP]
[CLS] soviet forces offered little resistance in the vast empty steppe ##s and started streaming eastward . [SEP]
[CLS] several attempts to re - establish a defensive line failed when german units out ##fl ##an ##ked them . [SEP]
[CLS] two major pockets were formed and destroyed : the first , northeast of k ##har ##kov , on 2 july , and a second , around miller ##ovo , ro ##stov oblast , a week later . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , the hungarian 2nd army and the german 4th panzer army had launched an assault on vo ##rone ##zh , capturing the city on 5 july . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial advance of the 6th army was so successful that hitler intervened and ordered the 4th panzer army to join army group south ( a ) to the south . [SEP]
[CLS] a massive traffic jam resulted when the 4th panzer and the 1st panzer both required the few roads in the area . [SEP]
[CLS] both armies were stopped dead while they attempted to clear the resulting mess of thousands of vehicles . [SEP]
[CLS] the delay was long , and it is thought that it cost the advance at least one week . [SEP]
[CLS] with the advance now slowed , hitler changed his mind and reassigned the 4th panzer army back to the attack on stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of july , the germans had pushed the soviets across the don river . [SEP]
[CLS] at this point , the don and volga rivers are only 65 km apart , and the germans left their main supply depot ##s west of the don , which had important implications later in the course of the battle . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans began using the armies of their italian , hungarian and romanian allies to guard their left ( northern ) flank . [SEP]
[CLS] occasionally italian actions were mentioned in official german com ##mun ##iques . [SEP]
[CLS] italian forces were generally held in little regard by the germans , and were accused of having low morale : in reality , the italian divisions fought comparatively well , with the 3rd mountain infantry division raven ##na and 5th infantry division co ##sser ##ia proving to have good morale , according to a german liaison officer , and were forced to retreat only after a massive armoured attack in which german reinforcements had failed to arrive in time , according to a german historian . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed the italians distinguished themselves in numerous battles , such as the battle of nikolay ##ev ##ka . [SEP]
[CLS] on 25 july the germans faced stiff resistance with a soviet bridge ##head west of kala ##ch . [SEP]
[CLS] " we had had to pay a high cost in men and material . . . left on the kala ##tch battlefield were numerous burnt - out or shot - up german tanks . " [SEP]
[CLS] the germans formed bridge ##heads across the don on 20 august , with the 295 ##th and 76 ##th infantry divisions enabling the xiv ##th panzer corps " to thrust to the volga north of stalin ##grad . " [SEP]
[CLS] the german 6th army was only a few dozen kilometers from stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] the 4th panzer army , ordered south on 13 july to block the soviet retreat " weakened by the 17th army and the 1st panzer army " , had turned northwards to help take the city from the south . [SEP]
[CLS] to the south , army group a was pushing far into the caucasus , but their advance slowed as supply lines grew over ##ex ##ten ##ded . [SEP]
[CLS] the two german army groups were not positioned to support one another due to the great distances involved . [SEP]
[CLS] after german intentions became clear in july 1942 , stalin appointed general andrey yer ##yo ##men ##ko as commander of the southeastern front on 1 august 1942 . [SEP]
[CLS] yer ##yo ##men ##ko and com ##mis ##sar nikita k ##hr ##ush ##chev were tasked with planning the defense of stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] the eastern border of stalin ##grad was the wide river volga , and over the river , additional soviet units were deployed . [SEP]
[CLS] these units became the newly formed 62 ##nd army , which yer ##yo ##men ##ko placed under the command of lieutenant general va ##sil ##iy chu ##iko ##v on 11 september 1942 . [SEP]
[CLS] the situation was extremely dire . [SEP]
[CLS] when asked how he interpreted his task , he responded " we will defend the city or die in the attempt . " [SEP]
[CLS] the 62 ##nd army ' s mission was to defend stalin ##grad at all costs . [SEP]
[CLS] chu ##iko ##v ' s generals ##hip during the battle earned him one of his two hero of the soviet union awards . [SEP]
[CLS] david g ##lan ##tz indicated that four hard - fought battles – collectively known as the ko ##tl ##uba ##n operations – north of stalin ##grad , where the soviets made their greatest stand , decided germany ' s fate before the nazis ever set foot in the city itself , and were a turning point in the war . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning in late august , continuing in september and into october , the soviets committed between two and four armies in hastily coordinated and poorly controlled attacks against the germans ' northern flank . [SEP]
[CLS] the actions resulted in more than 200 , 000 soviet army casualties but did slow the german assault . [SEP]
[CLS] on 23 august the 6th army reached the outskirts of stalin ##grad in pursuit of the 62 ##nd and 64 ##th armies , which had fallen back into the city . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets had enough warning of the german advance to ship grain , cattle , and railway cars across the volga and out of harm ' s way , but most civilian residents were not evacuated . [SEP]
[CLS] this " harvest victory " left the city short of food even before the german attack began . [SEP]
[CLS] before the " hee ##r " reached the city itself , the " luftwaffe " had rendered the river volga , vital for bringing supplies into the city , un ##usa ##ble to soviet shipping . [SEP]
[CLS] between 25 and 31 july , 32 soviet ships were sunk , with another nine crippled . [SEP]
[CLS] the battle began with the heavy bombing of the city by " general ##obe ##rst " wolf ##ram von rich ##th ##of ##en ' s " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte 4 " , which in the summer and autumn of 1942 was the single most powerful air formation in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] some 1 , 000 tons of bombs were dropped in 48 hours , more than in london at the height of the blitz . [SEP]
[CLS] stalin refused to evacuate civilian population from the city , so when bombing began 400 , 000 civilians were trapped within city boundaries . [SEP]
[CLS] the exact number of civilians killed during the course of the battle is unknown but was most likely very high . [SEP]
[CLS] around 40 , 000 civilians were moved to germany as slave workers , some fled the city during battle and a small number were evacuated by the soviets . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 1943 only between 10 , 000 to 60 , 000 civilians were still alive in stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] much of the city was quickly turned to rubble , although some factories continued production while workers joined in the fighting . [SEP]
[CLS] the stalin ##grad tractor factory continued to turn out t - 34 tanks literally until german troops burst into the plant . [SEP]
[CLS] the 36 ##9th ( croatian ) reinforced infantry regiment was the only non - german unit selected by the " wehrmacht " to enter stalin ##grad city during assault operations . [SEP]
[CLS] it fought as part of the 100th ja ##ger division . [SEP]
[CLS] stalin rushed all available troops to the east bank of the volga , some from as far away as siberia . [SEP]
[CLS] all the regular ferries were quickly destroyed by the luftwaffe , which then targeted troop barges being towed slowly across the river by tugs . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been said that stalin prevented civilians from leaving the city in the belief that their presence would encourage greater resistance from the city ' s defenders . [SEP]
[CLS] civilians , including women and children , were put to work building trench ##works and protective fortifications . [SEP]
[CLS] a massive german air raid on 23 august caused a fires ##torm , killing hundreds and turning stalin ##grad into a vast landscape of rubble and burnt ruins . [SEP]
[CLS] ninety percent of the living space in the vo ##ros ##hil ##ov ##ski ##y area was destroyed . [SEP]
[CLS] between 23 and 26 august , soviet reports indicate 95 ##5 people were killed and another 1 , 181 wounded as a result of the bombing . [SEP]
[CLS] casualties of 40 , 000 were greatly exaggerated , and after 25 august the soviets did not record any civilian and military casualties as a result of air raids . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet air force , the " vo ##yen ##no - vo ##zd ##ush ##ny ##e si ##ly " ( v ##vs ) , was swept aside by the luftwaffe . [SEP]
[CLS] the v ##vs bases in the immediate area lost 201 aircraft between 23 and 31 august , and despite me ##ager reinforcements of some 100 aircraft in august , it was left with just 192 service ##able aircraft , 57 of which were fighters . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets continued to pour aerial reinforcements into the stalin ##grad area in late september , but continued to suffer app ##all ##ing losses ; the " luftwaffe " had complete control of the skies . [SEP]
[CLS] the burden of the initial defense of the city fell on the 107 ##7th anti - aircraft regiment , a unit made up mainly of young female volunteers who had no training for engaging ground targets . [SEP]
[CLS] despite this , and with no support available from other units , the aa gunners stayed at their posts and took on the advancing panzer ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the german 16th panzer division reportedly had to fight the 107 ##7th ' s gunners " shot for shot " until all 37 anti - aircraft guns were destroyed or overrun . [SEP]
[CLS] the 16th panzer was shocked to find that , due to soviet manpower shortages , it had been fighting female soldiers . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early stages of the battle , the nk ##vd organized poorly armed " workers ' militias " similar to those that had defended the city twenty - four years earlier , composed of civilians not directly involved in war production for immediate use in the battle . [SEP]
[CLS] the civilians were often sent into battle without rifles . [SEP]
[CLS] staff and students from the local technical university formed a " tank destroyer " unit . [SEP]
[CLS] they assembled tanks from left ##over parts at the tractor factory . [SEP]
[CLS] these tanks , un ##pa ##int ##ed and lacking guns ##ight ##s , were driven directly from the factory floor to the front line . [SEP]
[CLS] they could only be aimed at point - blank range through the gun barrel . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of august , army group south ( b ) had finally reached the volga , north of stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] another advance to the river south of the city followed , while the soviets abandoned their ross ##osh ##ka position for the inner defensive ring west of stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] the wings of the 6th army and the 4th panzer army met near ja ##bl ##ot ##ch ##ni along the za ##rit ##za on 2 sept . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1 september , the soviets could only reinforce and supply their forces in stalin ##grad by per ##ilo ##us crossings of the volga under constant bombardment by artillery and aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] on 5 september , the soviet 24th and 66 ##th armies organized a massive attack against xiv panzer corps . [SEP]
[CLS] the " luftwaffe " helped rep ##uls ##e the offensive by heavily attacking soviet artillery positions and defensive lines . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets were forced to withdraw at midday after only a few hours . [SEP]
[CLS] of the 120 tanks the soviets had committed , 30 were lost to air attack . [SEP]
[CLS] soviet operations were constantly hampered by the " luftwaffe " . [SEP]
[CLS] on 18 september , the soviet 1st guards and 24th army launched an offensive against viii army corps at ko ##tl ##uba ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] fl ##ieg ##er ##kor ##ps " dispatched wave after wave of stu ##ka dive - bombers to prevent a breakthrough . [SEP]
[CLS] the offensive was repulsed . [SEP]
[CLS] the stu ##kas claimed 41 of the 106 soviet tanks knocked out that morning , while escorting bf 109 ##s destroyed 77 soviet aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] amid the debris of the wrecked city , the soviet 62 ##nd and 64 ##th armies , which included the soviet 13th guards rifle division , anchored their defense lines with strong ##points in houses and factories . [SEP]
[CLS] fighting within the ruined city was fierce and desperate . [SEP]
[CLS] lieutenant general alexander rod ##im ##ts ##ev was in charge of the 13th guards rifle division , and received one of two heroes of the soviet union awarded during the battle for his actions . [SEP]
[CLS] stalin ' s order no . 227 of 27 july 1942 decreed that all commanders who ordered unauthorized retreat would be subject to a military tribunal . [SEP]
[CLS] desert ##ers and presumed mali ##nger ##ers were captured or executed after fighting . during the battle the 62 ##nd army had the most arrests and executions : 203 in all , of which 49 were executed , while 139 were sent to penal companies and battalions . the germans pushing forward into stalin ##grad suffered heavy casualties . [SEP]
[CLS] by 12 september , at the time of their retreat into the city , the soviet 62 ##nd army had been reduced to 90 tanks , 700 mortar ##s and just 20 , 000 personnel . [SEP]
[CLS] the remaining tanks were used as im ##mobile strong ##points within the city . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial german attack on 14 september attempted to take the city in a rush . [SEP]
[CLS] the 51st army corps ' 295 ##th infantry division went after the mama ##yev ku ##rgan hill , the 71 ##st attacked the central rail station and toward the central landing stage on the volga , while 48th panzer corps attacked south of the tsar ##its ##a river . [SEP]
[CLS] rod ##im ##ts ##ev ' s 13th guards rifle division had been hurried up to cross the river and join the defenders inside the city . [SEP]
[CLS] assigned to counterattack at the mama ##yev ku ##rgan and at railway station no . 1 it suffered particularly heavy losses . [SEP]
[CLS] though initially successful , the german attacks stalled in the face of soviet reinforcements brought in from across the volga . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet 13th guards rifle division , assigned to counterattack at the mama ##yev ku ##rgan and at railway station no . 1 suffered particularly heavy losses . [SEP]
[CLS] over 30 percent of its soldiers were killed in the first 24 hours , and just 320 out of the original 10 , 000 survived the entire battle . [SEP]
[CLS] both objectives were re ##taken , but only temporarily . [SEP]
[CLS] the railway station changed hands 14 times in six hours . [SEP]
[CLS] by the following evening , the 13th guards rifle division had ceased to exist . [SEP]
[CLS] combat raged for three days at the giant grain elevator in the south of the city . [SEP]
[CLS] about fifty red army defenders , cut off from res ##up ##ply , held the position for five days and fought off ten different assaults before running out of ammunition and water . [SEP]
[CLS] only forty dead soviet fighters were found , though the germans had thought there were many more due to the intensity of resistance . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets burned large amounts of grain during their retreat in order to deny the enemy food . [SEP]
[CLS] paul ##us chose the grain elevator and si ##los as the symbol of stalin ##grad for a patch he was having designed to commemorate the battle after a german victory . [SEP]
[CLS] german military doctrine was based on the principle of combined - arms teams and close cooperation between tanks , infantry , engineers , artillery and ground - attack aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] some soviet commanders adopted the tactic of always keeping their front - line positions as close to the germans as physically possible ; chu ##iko ##v called this " hugging " the germans . [SEP]
[CLS] this slowed the german advance and reduced the effectiveness of the german advantage in supporting fire . [SEP]
[CLS] the red army gradually adopted a strategy to hold for as long as possible all the ground in the city . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , they converted multi - floor ##ed apartment blocks , factories , warehouses , street corner residences and office buildings into a series of well defended strong ##points with small 5 – 10 man units . [SEP]
[CLS] manpower in the city was constantly ref ##resh ##ed by bringing additional troops over the volga . [SEP]
[CLS] when a position was lost , an immediate attempt was usually made to re - take it with fresh forces . [SEP]
[CLS] bitter fighting raged for every ruin , street , factory , house , basement , and staircase . [SEP]
[CLS] even the sewer ##s were the sites of fire ##fight ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans called this unseen urban warfare " rat ##ten ##kr ##ieg " ( " rat war " ) , and bitterly joked about capturing the kitchen but still fighting for the living room and the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] buildings had to be cleared room by room through the bombed - out debris of residential neighborhoods , office blocks , basement ##s and apartment high - rises . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the taller buildings , blasted into roof ##less shells by earlier german aerial bombardment , saw floor - by - floor , close quarters combat , with the germans and soviets on alternate levels , firing at each other through holes in the floors . [SEP]
[CLS] fighting on and around mama ##yev ku ##rgan , a prominent hill above the city , was particularly mer ##ci ##less ; indeed , the position changed hands many times . [SEP]
[CLS] in another part of the city , a soviet platoon under the command of sergeant ya ##kov pa ##v ##lov fortified a four - story building that oversaw a square 300 meters from the river bank , later called " pa ##v ##lov ' s house " . [SEP]
[CLS] the soldiers surrounded it with mine ##fields , set up machine - gun positions at the windows and breached the walls in the basement for better communications . [SEP]
[CLS] the soldiers found about ten soviet civilians hiding in the basement . [SEP]
[CLS] they were not relieved , and not significantly reinforced , for two months . [SEP]
[CLS] the building was labeled " fest ##ung " ( " fortress " ) on german maps . [SEP]
[CLS] sgt . pa ##v ##lov was awarded the hero of the soviet union for his actions . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans made slow but steady progress through the city . [SEP]
[CLS] positions were taken individually , but the germans were never able to capture the key crossing points along the river bank . [SEP]
[CLS] by 27 sept . the germans occupied the southern portion of the city , but the soviets held the center and northern part . [SEP]
[CLS] most importantly , the soviets controlled the ferries to their supplies on the east bank of the volga . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans used air ##power , tanks and heavy artillery to clear the city with varying degrees of success . [SEP]
[CLS] toward the end of the battle , the gigantic railroad gun nicknamed " dora " was brought into the area . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets built up a large number of artillery batteries on the east bank of the volga . [SEP]
[CLS] this artillery was able to bomb ##ard the german positions or at least provide counter - battery fire . [SEP]
[CLS] sniper ##s on both sides used the ruins to in ##flict casualties . [SEP]
[CLS] the most famous soviet sniper in stalin ##grad was va ##sily za ##yt ##se ##v , with 225 confirmed kills during the battle . [SEP]
[CLS] targets were often soldiers bringing up food or water to forward positions . [SEP]
[CLS] artillery spot ##ters were an especially prized target for sniper ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] a significant historical debate concerns the degree of terror in the red army . [SEP]
[CLS] the british historian antony bee ##vor noted the " sinister " message from the stalin ##grad front ' s political department on 8 october 1942 that : " the defeat ##ist mood is almost eliminated and the number of treason ##ous incidents is getting lower " as an example of the sort of coe ##rc ##ion red army soldiers experienced under the special detachments ( later to be renamed sm ##ers ##h ) . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , bee ##vor noted the often extraordinary bravery of the soviet soldiers in a battle that was only comparable to ve ##rd ##un , and argued that terror alone cannot explain such self - sacrifice . [SEP]
[CLS] richard over ##y addresses the question of just how important the red army ' s coe ##rc ##ive methods were to the soviet war effort compared with other motivation ##al factors such as hatred for the enemy . [SEP]
[CLS] he argues that , though it is " easy to argue that from the summer of 1942 the soviet army fought because it was forced to fight , " to concentrate solely on coe ##rc ##ion is nonetheless to " di ##stor ##t our view of the soviet war effort . " [SEP]
[CLS] after conducting hundreds of interviews with soviet veterans on the subject of terror on the eastern front – and specifically about order no . 227 ( " not a step back ! " ) [SEP]
[CLS] at stalin ##grad – catherine mer ##rid ##ale notes that , seemingly paradox ##ically , " their response was frequently relief . " [SEP]
[CLS] infantry ##man lev l ##vo ##vich ' s explanation , for example , is typical for these interviews ; as he recalls , " it was a necessary and important step . [SEP]
[CLS] we all knew where we stood after we had heard it . [SEP]
[CLS] and we all – it ' s true – felt better . [SEP]
[CLS] yes , we felt better . " [SEP]
[CLS] many women fought on the soviet side , or were under fire . [SEP]
[CLS] as general chu ##iko ##v acknowledged , " remembering the defence of stalin ##grad , i can ' t overlook the very important question . . . about the role of women in war , in the rear , but also at the front . [SEP]
[CLS] equally with men they bore all the burden ##s of combat life and together with us men , they went all the way to berlin . " [SEP]
[CLS] at the beginning of the battle there were 75 , 000 women and girls from the stalin ##grad area who had finished military or medical training , and all of whom were to serve in the battle . [SEP]
[CLS] women staffed a great many of the anti - aircraft batteries that fought not only the luftwaffe but german tanks . [SEP]
[CLS] soviet nurses not only treated wounded personnel under fire but were involved in the highly dangerous work of bringing wounded soldiers back to the hospitals under enemy fire . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the soviet wireless and telephone operators were women who often suffered heavy casualties when their command posts came under fire . [SEP]
[CLS] though women were not usually trained as infantry , many soviet women fought as machine gunners , mortar operators , and scouts . [SEP]
[CLS] women were also sniper ##s at stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] three air regiments at stalin ##grad were entirely female . [SEP]
[CLS] at least three women won the title hero of the soviet union while driving tanks at stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] for both stalin and hitler , stalin ##grad became a matter of prestige far beyond its strategic significance . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet command moved units from the red army strategic reserve in the moscow area to the lower volga , and transferred aircraft from the entire country to the stalin ##grad region . [SEP]
[CLS] the strain on both military commanders was immense : paul ##us developed an un ##con ##tro ##lla ##ble ti ##c in his eye , which eventually af ##flict ##ed the left side of his face , while chu ##iko ##v experienced an outbreak of ec ##ze ##ma that required him to have his hands completely bandage ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] troops on both sides faced the constant strain of close - range combat . [SEP]
[CLS] after 27 september , much of the fighting in the city shifted north to the industrial district . [SEP]
[CLS] having slowly advanced over 10 days against strong soviet resistance , the 51st army corps was finally in front of the three giant factories of stalin ##grad : the red october steel factory , the barr ##ika ##dy arms factory and stalin ##grad tractor factory . [SEP]
[CLS] it took a few more days for them to prepare for the most savage offensive of all , which was unleashed on 14 october with a concentration of gunfire never seen before . [SEP]
[CLS] exceptionally intense shell ##ing and bombing paved the way for the first german assault groups . [SEP]
[CLS] the main attack ( led by the 14th panzer and 305 ##th infantry divisions ) attacked towards the tractor factory , while another assault led by the 24th panzer division hit to the south of the giant plant . [SEP]
[CLS] the german onslaught crushed the 37th guards rifle division and in the afternoon the forward assault group reached the tractor factory before arriving at the volga river , splitting the 62 ##nd army into two . [SEP]
[CLS] fighting raged inside the barr ##ika ##dy factory until the end of october . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet - controlled area sh ##rank down to a few strips of land along the western bank of the volga , and in november the fighting concentrated around what soviet newspapers referred to as " l ##yu ##d ##nikov ' s island " , a small patch of ground behind the barr ##ika ##dy factory where the remnants of colonel ivan l ##yu ##d ##nikov ' s 138 ##th rifle division resisted all ferocious assaults thrown by the germans and became a symbol of the stout soviet defense of stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] from 5 to 12 september , " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte 4 " conducted 7 , 50 ##7 sort ##ies ( 93 ##8 per day ) . [SEP]
[CLS] from 16 to 25 september , it carried out 9 , 74 ##6 missions ( 97 ##5 per day ) . [SEP]
[CLS] determined to crush soviet resistance , " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte " 4 ' s " stu ##kawa ##ffe " flew 900 individual sort ##ies against soviet positions at the " d ##zer ##zhi ##nsk ##iy " tractor factory on 5 october . [SEP]
[CLS] several soviet regiments were wiped out ; the entire staff of the soviet 339 ##th infantry regiment was killed the following morning during an air raid . [SEP]
[CLS] the " luftwaffe " retained air superiority into november , and soviet daytime aerial resistance was none ##xi ##sten ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the combination of constant air support operations on the german side and the soviet surrender of the daytime skies began to affect the strategic balance in the air . [SEP]
[CLS] from 28 june to 20 september , " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte " 4 ' s original strength of 1 , 600 aircraft , of which 1 , 155 were operational , fell to 950 , of which only 550 were operational . [SEP]
[CLS] the fleet ' s total strength decreased by 40 percent . [SEP]
[CLS] daily sort ##ies decreased from 1 , 343 per day to 97 ##5 per day . [SEP]
[CLS] soviet offensive ##s in the central and northern portions of the eastern front tied down luftwaffe reserves and newly built aircraft , reducing " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte " 4 ' s percentage of eastern front aircraft from 60 percent on 28 june to 38 percent by 20 september . [SEP]
[CLS] the " kam ##pf ##wa ##ffe " ( bomber force ) was the hardest hit , having only 232 out of an original force of 480 left . [SEP]
[CLS] the " v ##vs " remained qu ##ali ##tative ##ly inferior , but by the time of the soviet counter - offensive , the " v ##vs " had reached numerical superiority . [SEP]
[CLS] in mid - october , after receiving reinforcements from the caucasus theater , the " luftwaffe " intensified its efforts against remaining red army positions holding the west bank . [SEP]
[CLS] " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte " 4 flew 1 , 250 sort ##ies on 14 october and its stu ##kas dropped 550 tonnes of bombs , while german infantry surrounded the three factories . [SEP]
[CLS] " stu ##ka ##ges ##ch ##wad ##er " 1 , 2 , and 77 had largely silenced soviet artillery on the eastern bank of the volga before turning their attention to the shipping that was once again trying to reinforce the narrowing soviet pockets of resistance . [SEP]
[CLS] the 62 ##nd army had been cut in two and , due to intensive air attack on its supply ferries , was receiving much less material support . [SEP]
[CLS] with the soviets forced into a 1 km strip of land on the western bank of the volga , over 1 , 208 " stu ##ka " missions were flown in an effort to eliminate them . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet bomber force , the " av ##ia ##ts ##iya dal ' ne ##go de ##yst ##vi ##ya " ( long range aviation ; add ) , having taken cr ##ip ##pling losses over the past 18 months , was restricted to flying at night . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets flew 11 , 317 night sort ##ies over stalin ##grad and the don - bend sector between 17 july and 19 november . [SEP]
[CLS] these raids caused little damage and were of nu ##isance value only . [SEP]
[CLS] on 8 november , substantial units from " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte " 4 were withdrawn to combat the allied landings in north africa . [SEP]
[CLS] the german air arm found itself spread thin ##ly across europe , struggling to maintain its strength in the other southern sectors of the soviet - german front . [SEP]
[CLS] as historian chris bellamy notes , the germans paid a high strategic price for the aircraft sent into stalin ##grad : the " luftwaffe " was forced to divert much of its air strength away from the oil - rich caucasus , which had been hitler ' s original grand - strategic objective . [SEP]
[CLS] the royal romanian air force was also involved in the axis air operations at stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] starting 23 october 1942 , romanian pilots flew a total of 4 , 000 sort ##ies , during which they destroyed 61 soviet aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] the romanian air force lost 79 aircraft , most of them captured on the ground along with their airfields . [SEP]
[CLS] after three months of slow advance , the germans finally reached the river banks , capturing 90 % of the ruined city and splitting the remaining soviet forces into two narrow pockets . [SEP]
[CLS] ice fl ##oes on the volga now prevented boats and tugs from supplying the soviet defenders . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , the fighting continued , especially on the slopes of mama ##yev ku ##rgan and inside the factory area in the northern part of the city . [SEP]
[CLS] from 21 august to 20 november , the german 6th army lost 60 , 54 ##8 men , including 12 , 78 ##2 killed , 45 , 54 ##5 wounded and 2 , 221 missing . [SEP]
[CLS] recognizing that german troops were ill - prepared for offensive operations during the winter of 1942 , and that most of them were red ##ep ##lo ##yed elsewhere on the southern sector of the eastern front , the st ##av ##ka decided to conduct a number of offensive operations between 19 november 1942 and 2 february 1943 . [SEP]
[CLS] these operations opened the winter campaign of 1942 – 1943 ( 19 november 1942 – 3 march 1943 ) , which involved some 15 armies operating on several fronts . [SEP]
[CLS] according to zhu ##kov , " " german operational blu ##nder ##s were aggravated by poor intelligence : they failed to spot preparations for the major counter - offensive near stalin ##grad where there were 10 field , 1 tank and 4 air armies . " " [SEP]
[CLS] during the siege , the german and allied italian , hungarian , and romanian armies protecting army group b ' s north and south flanks had pressed their headquarters for support . [SEP]
[CLS] the hungarian 2nd army was given the task of defending a 200 km section of the front north of stalin ##grad between the italian army and vo ##rone ##zh . [SEP]
[CLS] this resulted in a very thin line , with some sectors where 1 – stretches were being defended by a single platoon . [SEP]
[CLS] these forces were also lacking in effective anti - tank weapons . [SEP]
[CLS] zhu ##kov states , " compared with the germans , the troops of the satellites were not so well armed , less experienced and less efficient , even in defence . " [SEP]
[CLS] because of the total focus on the city , the axis forces had neglected for months to consolidate their positions along the natural defensive line of the don river . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet forces were allowed to retain bridge ##heads on the right bank from which offensive operations could be quickly launched . [SEP]
[CLS] these bridge ##heads in retro ##sp ##ect presented a serious threat to army group b . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , on the southern flank of the stalin ##grad sector the front southwest of ko ##tel ##nikov ##o was held only by the romanian 4th army . [SEP]
[CLS] beyond that army , a single german division , the 16th motorized infantry , covered 400 km . [SEP]
[CLS] paul ##us had requested permission to " withdraw the 6th army behind the don , " but was rejected . [SEP]
[CLS] according to paul ##us ' comments to adam , " there is still the order whereby no commander of an army group or an army has the right to re ##lin ##qui ##sh a village , even a trench , without hitler ' s consent . " [SEP]
[CLS] in autumn , the soviet generals georg ##y zhu ##kov and aleksandr va ##sil ##evsky , responsible for strategic planning in the stalin ##grad area , concentrated forces in the steppe ##s to the north and south of the city . [SEP]
[CLS] the northern flank was defended by hungarian and romanian units , often in open positions on the steppe ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the natural line of defense , the don river , had never been properly established by the german side . [SEP]
[CLS] the armies in the area were also poorly equipped in terms of anti - tank weapons . [SEP]
[CLS] the plan was to punch through the overs ##tre ##tched and weakly defended german flanks and surround the german forces in the stalin ##grad region . [SEP]
[CLS] during the preparations for the attack , marshal zhu ##kov personally visited the front and noticing the poor organization , insisted on a one - week delay in the start date of the planned attack . [SEP]
[CLS] the operation was code - named " ur ##anus " and launched in conjunction with operation mars , which was directed at army group center . [SEP]
[CLS] the plan was similar to the one zhu ##kov had used to achieve victory at k ##hal ##kh ##in go ##l three years before , where he had sprung a double en ##vel ##op ##ment and destroyed the 23rd division of the japanese army . [SEP]
[CLS] on 19 november 1942 , the red army launched operation ur ##anus . [SEP]
[CLS] the attacking soviet units under the command of gen . nikolay va ##tu ##tin consisted of three complete armies , the 1st guards army , 5th tank army , and 21st army , including a total of 18 infantry divisions , eight tank brigades , two motorized brigades , six cavalry divisions and one anti - tank brigade . [SEP]
[CLS] the preparations for the attack could be heard by the romanian ##s , who continued to push for reinforcements , only to be refused again . [SEP]
[CLS] thin ##ly spread , deployed in exposed positions , outnumbered and poorly equipped , the romanian 3rd army , which held the northern flank of the german 6th army , was overrun . [SEP]
[CLS] behind the front lines , no preparations had been made to defend key points in the rear such as kala ##ch . [SEP]
[CLS] the response by the " wehrmacht " was both chaotic and ind ##ec ##isi ##ve . [SEP]
[CLS] poor weather prevented effective air action against the soviet offensive . [SEP]
[CLS] army group b was in di ##sar ##ray and faced strong soviet pressure across all its fronts . [SEP]
[CLS] hence it was ineffective in re ##lie ##ving the 6th army . [SEP]
[CLS] on 20 november , a second soviet offensive ( two armies ) was launched to the south of stalin ##grad against points held by the romanian 4th army corps . [SEP]
[CLS] the romanian forces , made up primarily of infantry , were overrun by large numbers of tanks . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet forces raced west and met on 23 november at the town of kala ##ch , sealing the ring around stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] the link - up of the soviet forces , not filmed at the time , was later re - enacted for a propaganda film which was shown worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] the surrounded axis personnel comprised 265 , 000 germans , romanian ##s , italians , and the croatian ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , the german 6th army included between 40 , 000 and 65 , 000 " hi ##lf ##sw ##ill ##ige " ( " hi ##wi " ) , or " volunteer aux ##ilia ##ries " , a term used for personnel recruited amongst soviet pow ##s and civilians from areas under occupation . [SEP]
[CLS] " hi ##wi " often proved to be reliable axis personnel in rear areas and were used for supporting roles , but also served in some front ##line units as their numbers had increased . [SEP]
[CLS] german personnel in the pocket numbered about 210 , 000 , according to strength breakdown ##s of the 20 field divisions ( average size 9 , 000 ) and 100 battalion sized units of the sixth army on 19 november 1942 . [SEP]
[CLS] inside the pocket ( , literally " ca ##uld ##ron " ) , there were also around 10 , 000 soviet civilians and several thousand soviet soldiers the germans had taken captive during the battle . [SEP]
[CLS] not all of the 6th army was trapped : 50 , 000 soldiers were brushed aside outside the pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] these belonged mostly to the other two divisions of the 6th army between the italian and romanian armies : the 62 ##nd and 298 ##th infantry divisions . [SEP]
[CLS] of the 210 , 000 germans , 10 , 000 remained to fight on , 105 , 000 surrendered , 35 , 000 left by air and the remaining 60 , 000 died . [SEP]
[CLS] even with the desperate situation of the sixth army , army group a continued their invasion of the caucasus further south from 19 november until 19 december . [SEP]
[CLS] by 19 december the german army was in full retreat out of the caucasus , while using the sixth army to tie down the soviet forces . [SEP]
[CLS] hence army group a was never used to help relieve the sixth army . [SEP]
[CLS] army group don was formed under field marshal von mans ##tein . [SEP]
[CLS] under his command were the 20 german and 2 romanian divisions encircled at stalin ##grad , adam ' s battle groups formed along the chi ##r river and on the don bridge ##head , plus the remains of the romanian 3rd army . [SEP]
[CLS] the red army units immediately formed two defensive fronts : a ci ##rc ##um ##val ##lation facing inward and a contra ##val ##lation facing outward . [SEP]
[CLS] field marshal erich von mans ##tein advised hitler not to order the 6th army to break out , stating that he could break through the soviet lines and relieve the besieged 6th army . [SEP]
[CLS] the american historians williamson murray and alan mill ##et wrote that it was mans ##tein ' s message to hitler on 24 november advising him that the 6th army should not break out , along with go ##ring ' s statements that the luftwaffe could supply stalin ##grad that " . . . sealed the fate of the sixth army . " [SEP]
[CLS] after 1945 , mans ##tein claimed that he told hitler that the 6th army must break out . [SEP]
[CLS] the american historian gerhard wei ##nberg wrote that mans ##tein distorted his record on the matter . [SEP]
[CLS] mans ##tein was tasked to conduct a relief operation , named operation winter storm ( " un ##tern ##eh ##men winter ##ge ##wi ##tter " ) against stalin ##grad , which he thought was feasible if the 6th army was temporarily supplied through the air . [SEP]
[CLS] adolf hitler had declared in a public speech ( in the berlin sport ##pala ##st ) on 30 september 1942 that the german army would never leave the city . [SEP]
[CLS] at a meeting shortly after the soviet en ##ci ##rcle ##ment , german army chiefs pushed for an immediate breakout to a new line on the west of the don , but hitler was at his bavarian retreat of obe ##rsa ##lz ##berg in be ##rch ##tes ##ga ##den with the head of the " luftwaffe " , hermann go ##ring . [SEP]
[CLS] when asked by hitler , go ##ring replied , after being convinced by hans je ##sch ##onne ##k , that the luftwaffe could supply the 6th army with an " air bridge . " [SEP]
[CLS] this would allow the germans in the city to fight on temporarily while a relief force was assembled . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar plan had been used a year earlier at the dem ##yan ##sk pocket , albeit on a much smaller scale : a corps at dem ##yan ##sk rather than an entire army . [SEP]
[CLS] the director of " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte " 4 , wolf ##ram von rich ##th ##of ##en , tried to get this decision overturned . [SEP]
[CLS] the forces under the 6th army were almost twice as large as a regular german army unit , plus there was also a corps of the 4th panzer army trapped in the pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] the maximum 107 tonnes they could deliver a day – based on the number of available aircraft and with only the airfield at pit ##om ##nik to land at – was far less than the minimum 750 tonnes needed . [SEP]
[CLS] to supplement the limited number of junk ##ers ju 52 transports , the germans pressed other aircraft into the role , such as the he ##ink ##el he 177 bomber ( some bombers performed adequately – the he ##ink ##el he 111 proved to be quite capable and was much faster than the ju 52 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] general rich ##th ##of ##en informed mans ##tein on 27 november of the small transport capacity of the luftwaffe and the imp ##oss ##ibility of supplying 300 tons a day by air . [SEP]
[CLS] mans ##tein now saw the enormous technical difficulties of a supply by air of these dimensions . [SEP]
[CLS] the next day he made a six - page situation report to the general staff . [SEP]
[CLS] based on the information of the expert rich ##th ##of ##en , he declared that contrary to the example of the pocket of dem ##yan ##sk the permanent supply by air would be impossible . [SEP]
[CLS] if only a narrow link could be established to sixth army , he proposed that this should be used to pull it out from the en ##ci ##rcle ##ment , and said that the luftwaffe should instead of supplies deliver only enough ammunition and fuel for a breakout attempt . [SEP]
[CLS] he acknowledged the heavy moral sacrifice that giving up stalin ##grad would mean , but this would be made easier to bear by con ##ser ##ving the combat power of the sixth army and regaining the initiative . [SEP]
[CLS] he ignored the limited mobility of the army and the difficulties of di ##sen ##ga ##ging the soviets . [SEP]
[CLS] hitler reiterated that the sixth army would stay at stalin ##grad and that the air bridge would supply it until the en ##ci ##rcle ##ment was broken by a new german offensive . [SEP]
[CLS] supplying the 270 , 000 men trapped in the " ca ##uld ##ron " required 700 tons of supplies a day . [SEP]
[CLS] that would mean 350 ju 52 flights a day into pit ##om ##nik . [SEP]
[CLS] at a minimum , 500 tons were required . [SEP]
[CLS] however , according to adam , " on not one single day have the minimal essential number of tons of supplies been flown in . " [SEP]
[CLS] the " luftwaffe " was able to deliver an average of 85 tonnes of supplies per day out of an air transport capacity of 106 tonnes per day . [SEP]
[CLS] the most successful day , 19 december , the " luftwaffe " delivered 262 tonnes of supplies in 154 flights . [SEP]
[CLS] the outcome of the airlift was the luftwaffe ' s failure to provide its transport units with the tools they needed to maintain an adequate count of operational aircraft – tools that included airfield facilities , supplies , manpower , and even aircraft suited to the prevailing conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] these factors , taken together , prevented the luftwaffe from effectively employing the full potential of its transport forces , ensuring that they were unable to deliver the quantity of supplies needed to sustain the 6th army . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early parts of the operation , fuel was shipped at a higher priority than food and ammunition because of a belief that there would be a breakout from the city . [SEP]
[CLS] transport aircraft also evacuated technical specialists and sick or wounded personnel from the besieged enclave . [SEP]
[CLS] sources differ on the number flown out : at least 25 , 000 to at most 35 , 000 . [SEP]
[CLS] initially , supply flights came in from the field at ta ##ts ##ins ##kaya , called ' ta ##zi ' by the german pilots . [SEP]
[CLS] on 23 december , the soviet 24th tank corps , commanded by major - general va ##sily mi ##kha ##yl ##ovich bad ##anov , reached nearby ska ##ssi ##rsk ##aya and in the early morning of 24 december , the tanks reached ta ##ts ##ins ##kaya . [SEP]
[CLS] without any soldiers to defend the airfield , it was abandoned under heavy fire ; in a little under an hour , 108 ju 52 ##s and 16 ju 86 ##s took off for novo ##cher ##kas ##sk – leaving 72 ju 52 ##s and many other aircraft burning on the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] a new base was established some 300 km from stalin ##grad at sal ##sk , the additional distance would become another obstacle to the res ##up ##ply efforts . [SEP]
[CLS] sal ##sk was abandoned in turn by mid - january for a rough facility at z ##vere ##vo , near sha ##kh ##ty . [SEP]
[CLS] the field at z ##vere ##vo was attacked repeatedly on 18 january and a further 50 ju 52 ##s were destroyed . [SEP]
[CLS] winter weather conditions , technical failures , heavy soviet anti - aircraft fire and fighter interceptions eventually led to the loss of 48 ##8 german aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] in spite of the failure of the german offensive to reach the 6th army , the air supply operation continued under ever more difficult circumstances . [SEP]
[CLS] the 6th army slowly starved . [SEP]
[CLS] general ze ##itz ##ler , moved by their plight , began to limit himself to their slim rations at meal times . [SEP]
[CLS] after a few weeks on such a diet , he had " visibly lost weight " , according to albert sp ##eer , and hitler " commanded ze ##it ##ler to resume at once taking sufficient no ##uri ##sh ##ment . " [SEP]
[CLS] the toll on the " transport ##gr ##uppe ##n " was heavy . [SEP]
[CLS] 160 aircraft were destroyed and 328 were heavily damaged ( beyond repair ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some 266 junk ##ers ju 52 ##s were destroyed ; one - third of the fleet ' s strength on the eastern front . [SEP]
[CLS] the he 111 " gr ##uppe ##n " lost 165 aircraft in transport operations . [SEP]
[CLS] other losses included 42 ju 86 ##s , 9 f ##w 200 condor ##s , 5 he 177 bombers and 1 ju 290 . [SEP]
[CLS] the " luftwaffe " also lost close to 1 , 000 highly experienced bomber crew personnel . [SEP]
[CLS] so heavy were the " luftwaffe " ' s losses that four of " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte " 4 ' s transport units ( kg ##rz ##b ##v 700 , kg ##rz ##b ##v 900 , i . / kg ##rz ##b ##v 1 and ii . / [SEP]
[CLS] / kg ##z ##b ##v 1 ) were " formally dissolved . " [SEP]
[CLS] soviet forces consolidated their positions around stalin ##grad , and fierce fighting to shrink the pocket began . [SEP]
[CLS] operation winter storm ( " operation winter ##ge ##wi ##tter " ) , the german attempt led by erich von mans ##tein to relieve the trapped army from the south , was initially successful . [SEP]
[CLS] by 18 december , the german army had pushed to within 48 km ( 30 mi ) of sixth army ' s positions . [SEP]
[CLS] however the predictable nature of the relief operation brought significant risk for all german forces in the area . [SEP]
[CLS] the starving encircled forces at stalin ##grad made no attempt to break out or link up with mans ##tein ' s advance . [SEP]
[CLS] some german officers requested that paul ##us def ##y hitler ' s orders to stand fast and instead attempt to break out of the stalin ##grad pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] paul ##us refused , concerned about the red army attacks on the flank of army group don and army group b in their advance on ro ##stov - on - don , " an early abandonment " of stalin ##grad " would result in the destruction of army group a in the caucasus , " and the fact that his 6th army tanks only had fuel for a 30 km advance towards hot ##h ' s spear ##head , a futile effort if they did not receive assurance of res ##up ##ply by air . [SEP]
[CLS] of his questions to army group don , paul ##us was told " wait , implement operation ' thunder ##cl ##ap ' only on explicit orders ! " , [SEP]
[CLS] , operation thunder ##cl ##ap being the code word initiating the breakout . [SEP]
[CLS] on 16 december , the soviets launched operation little saturn , which attempted to punch through the axis army ( mainly italians ) on the don and take ro ##stov . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans set up a " mobile defense " of small units that were to hold towns until supporting armor arrived . [SEP]
[CLS] from the soviet bridge ##head at ma ##mon , 15 divisions – supported by at least 100 tanks – attacked the italian co ##sser ##ia and raven ##na divisions , and although outnumbered 9 to 1 , the italians initially fought well , with the germans praising the quality of the italian defenders , but on 19 december , with the italian lines di ##sin ##te ##grating , arm ##ir headquarters ordered the battered divisions to withdraw to new lines . [SEP]
[CLS] the fighting forced a total rev ##al ##uation of the german situation . [SEP]
[CLS] sensing that this was the last chance for a breakout , mans ##tein pleaded with hitler on 18 december , but hitler refused . [SEP]
[CLS] paul ##us himself also doubted the feasibility of such a breakout . [SEP]
[CLS] the attempt to break through to stalin ##grad was abandoned and army group a was ordered to pull back from the caucasus . [SEP]
[CLS] the 6th army now was beyond all hope of german relief . [SEP]
[CLS] while a motor ##ised breakout might have been possible in the first few weeks , the 6th army now had insufficient fuel and the german soldiers would have faced great difficulty breaking through the soviet lines on foot in harsh winter conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] but in its defensive position on the volga , the 6th army continued to tie down a significant number of soviet armies . [SEP]
[CLS] on 23 december , the attempt to relieve stalin ##grad was abandoned and mans ##tein ' s forces switched over to the defensive to deal with new soviet offensive ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] as zhu ##kov states , " the military and political leadership of nazi germany sought not to relieve them , but to get them to fight on for as long possible so as to tie up the soviet forces . [SEP]
[CLS] the aim was to win as much time as possible to withdraw forces from the caucasus ( army group a ) and to rush troops from other fronts to form a new front that would be able in some measure to check our counter - offensive . " [SEP]
[CLS] the red army high command sent three envoy ##s while simultaneously aircraft and loud ##sp ##eak ##ers announced terms of cap ##it ##ulation on 7 january 1943 . [SEP]
[CLS] the letter was signed by colonel - general of artillery vo ##ron ##ov and the commander - in - chief of the don front , lieutenant - general ro ##kos ##sov ##ski . [SEP]
[CLS] a low - level soviet envoy party ( comprising major aleksandr sm ##ys ##lov , captain nikolay d ##yat ##len ##ko and a trumpeter ) carried an offer to paul ##us : if he surrendered within 24 hours , he would receive a guarantee of safety for all prisoners , medical care for the sick and wounded , prisoners being allowed to keep their personal belongings , " normal " food rations , and rep ##at ##riation to any country they wished after the war ; but paul ##us – ordered not to surrender by hitler – did not respond . [SEP]
[CLS] the german high command informed paul ##us , " every day that the army holds out longer helps the whole front and draws away the russian divisions from it . " [SEP]
[CLS] the germans inside the pocket retreated from the suburbs of stalin ##grad to the city itself . [SEP]
[CLS] the loss of the two airfields , at pit ##om ##nik on 16 january 1943 and gum ##rak on the night of 21 / 22 january , meant an end to air supplies and to the evacuation of the wounded . [SEP]
[CLS] the third and last service ##able runway was at the stalin ##grad ##skaya flight school , which reportedly had the last landings and takeoff ##s on 23 january . [SEP]
[CLS] after 23 january , there were no more reported landings , just intermittent air drops of ammunition and food until the end . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans were now not only starving , but running out of ammunition . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , they continued to resist , in part because they believed the soviets would execute any who surrendered . [SEP]
[CLS] in particular , the so - called " hi ##wi ##s " , soviet citizens fighting for the germans , had no illusions about their fate if captured . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets were initially surprised by the number of germans they had trapped , and had to reinforce their en ##ci ##rc ##ling troops . [SEP]
[CLS] bloody urban warfare began again in stalin ##grad , but this time it was the germans who were pushed back to the banks of the volga . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans adopted a simple defense of fixing wire nets over all windows to protect themselves from grenades . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets responded by fixing fish hooks to the grenades so they stuck to the nets when thrown . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans had no usable tanks in the city , and those that still functioned could , at best , be used as makeshift pill ##box ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets did not bother employing tanks in areas where the urban destruction restricted their mobility . [SEP]
[CLS] on 22 january , paul ##us requested that he be granted permission to surrender . [SEP]
[CLS] hitler rejected it on a point of honour . [SEP]
[CLS] he telegraph ##ed the 6th army later that day , claiming that it had made a historic contribution to the greatest struggle in german history and that it should stand fast " to the last soldier and the last bullet . " [SEP]
[CLS] hitler told go ##eb ##bel ##s that the plight of the 6th army was a " heroic drama of german history . " [SEP]
[CLS] on 24 january , in his radio report to hitler , paul ##us reported " 18 , 000 wounded without the slightest aid of bandages and medicines . " [SEP]
[CLS] on 26 january 1943 , the german forces inside stalin ##grad were split into two pockets north and south of mama ##i - ku ##rgan . [SEP]
[CLS] the northern pocket consisting of the viii ##th corps , under general walter he ##itz , and the xi ##th corps , was now cut off from telephone communication with paul ##us in the southern pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] now " each part of the ca ##uld ##ron came personally under hitler . " [SEP]
[CLS] on 28 january , the ca ##uld ##ron was split into three parts . [SEP]
[CLS] the northern ca ##uld ##ron consisted of the xi ##th corps , the central with the viii ##th and list corps , and the southern with the xiv ##th panzer corps and iv ##th corps " without units " . [SEP]
[CLS] the sick and wounded reached 40 , 000 to 50 , 000 . [SEP]
[CLS] on 30 january 1943 , the 10th anniversary of hitler ' s coming to power , go ##eb ##bel ##s read out a proclamation that included the sentence : " the heroic struggle of our soldiers on the volga should be a warning for everybody to do the utmost for the struggle for germany ' s freedom and the future of our people , and thus in a wider sense for the maintenance of our entire continent . " [SEP]
[CLS] hitler promoted paul ##us to the rank of " general ##feld ##mar ##sch ##all " . [SEP]
[CLS] no german field marshal had ever surrendered , and the implication was clear : if paul ##us surrendered , he would shame himself and would become the highest ranking german officer ever to be captured . [SEP]
[CLS] hitler believed that paul ##us would either fight to the last man or commit suicide . [SEP]
[CLS] on the next day , the southern pocket in stalin ##grad collapsed . [SEP]
[CLS] soviet forces reached the entrance to the german headquarters in the ruined gum department store . [SEP]
[CLS] general schmidt negotiated a surrender of the headquarters while paul ##us was unaware in another room . [SEP]
[CLS] when inter ##rogated by the soviets , paul ##us claimed that he had not surrendered . [SEP]
[CLS] he said that he had been taken by surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] he denied that he was the commander of the remaining northern pocket in stalin ##grad and refused to issue an order in his name for them to surrender . [SEP]
[CLS] the central pocket , under the command of he ##itz , surrendered the same day , while the northern pocket , under the command of karl st ##re ##cker , held out for two more days . [SEP]
[CLS] when st ##re ##cker finally surrendered he and his chief of staff , helmut ##h gr ##os ##cu ##rth , drafted the final signal sent from stalin ##grad , purposely om ##itt ##ing the customary ex ##cl ##ama ##tion to hitler , replacing it with " long live germany ! " [SEP]
[CLS] four soviet armies were deployed against the remaining northern pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] at four in the morning on 2 february , general st ##re ##cker was informed that one of his own officers had gone to the soviets to negotiate surrender terms . [SEP]
[CLS] seeing no point in continuing , he sent a radio message saying that his command had done its duty and fought to the last man . [SEP]
[CLS] around 91 , 000 exhausted , ill , wounded , and starving prisoners were taken , including 3 , 000 romanian ##s ( the survivors of the 20th infantry division , 1st cavalry division and " col . vo ##ic ##u " detachment ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the prisoners included 22 generals . [SEP]

[CLS] on 18 february , minister of propaganda joseph go ##eb ##bel ##s gave the famous " sport ##pala ##st " speech in berlin , encouraging the germans to accept a total war that would claim all resources and efforts from the entire population . [SEP]
[CLS] based on soviet records , over 10 , 000 german soldiers continued to resist in isolated groups within the city for the next month . [SEP]
[CLS] some have presumed that they were motivated by a belief that fighting on was better than a slow death in soviet captivity . [SEP]
[CLS] brown university historian om ##er bart ##ov claims they were motivated by national socialism . [SEP]
[CLS] he studied 11 , 237 letters sent by soldiers inside of stalin ##grad between 20 december 1942 and 16 january 1943 to their families in germany . [SEP]
[CLS] almost every letter expressed belief in germany ' s ultimate victory and their willingness to fight and die at stalin ##grad to achieve that victory . [SEP]
[CLS] bart ##ov reported that a great many of the soldiers were well aware that they would not be able to escape from stalin ##grad but in their letters to their families boasted that they were proud to " sacrifice themselves for the fu ##hrer " . [SEP]
[CLS] the remaining forces continued to resist , hiding in cellar ##s and sewer ##s but by early march 1943 , the last small and isolated pockets of resistance had surrendered . [SEP]

[CLS] some 35 , 000 were eventually sent on transports , of which 17 , 000 did not survive . [SEP]
[CLS] most died of wounds , disease ( particularly ty ##phus ) , cold , over ##work , mist ##rea ##tment and mal ##nut ##rit ##ion . [SEP]

[CLS] a year of german gains during case blue had been wiped out . [SEP]
[CLS] germany ' s sixth army had ceased to exist , and the forces of germany ' s european allies , except finland , had been shattered . [SEP]
[CLS] in a speech on 9 november 1944 , hitler himself blamed stalin ##grad for germany ' s impending doom . [SEP]
[CLS] the destruction of an entire army ( the largest killed , captured , wounded figures for axis soldiers , nearly 1 million , during the war ) and the frustration of germany ' s grand strategy made the battle a watershed moment . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time , the global significance of the battle was not in doubt . [SEP]
[CLS] at this point , the british had won the battle of el alam ##ein in november 1942 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , there were only about 50 , 000 german soldiers at el alam ##ein in egypt , while at stalin ##grad 200 , 000 germans had been lost . [SEP]

[CLS] a ceremonial sword of stalin ##grad was forged by king george vi . [SEP]
[CLS] after being put on public display in britain , this was presented to stalin by winston churchill at the tehran conference later in 1943 . [SEP]
[CLS] soviet propaganda spared no effort and wasted no time in capital ##ising on the triumph , impress ##ing a global audience . [SEP]
[CLS] the prestige of stalin , the soviet union , and the worldwide communist movement was immense , and their political position greatly enhanced . [SEP]
[CLS] in recognition of the determination of its defenders , stalin ##grad was awarded the title hero city in 1945 . [SEP]
[CLS] a colossal monument called the mother ##land calls was erected in 1967 on mama ##yev ku ##rgan , the hill overlooking the city where bones and rusty metal splinter ##s can still be found . [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] the calculation of casualties depends on what scope is given to the battle of stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] the scope can vary from the fighting in the city and suburbs to the inclusion of almost all fighting on the southern wing of the soviet – german front from the spring of 1942 to the end of the fighting in the city in the winter of 1943 . [SEP]
[CLS] scholars have produced different estimates depending on their definition of the scope of the battle . [SEP]
[CLS] the difference is comparing the city against the region . [SEP]
[CLS] totally , 235 , 000 german and allied troops from all units , including mans ##tein ' s ill ##fat ##ed relief force , were captured during the battle . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans lost 900 aircraft ( including 274 transports and 165 bombers used as transports ) , 500 tanks and 6 , 000 artillery pieces . [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] in addition , an unknown amount of hungarian , italian , and romanian mater ##iel was lost . [SEP]
[CLS] the situation of the romanian tanks is known , however . [SEP]
[CLS] before " operation ur ##anus " , the 1st romanian armored division consisted of 121 r - 2 light tanks and 19 german - produced tanks ( panzer iii and iv ) . [SEP]
[CLS] all of the 19 german tanks were lost , as well as 81 of the r - 2 light tanks . [SEP]
[CLS] only 27 of the latter were lost in combat , however , the remaining 54 being abandoned after breaking down or running out of fuel . [SEP]
[CLS] ultimately , however , romanian armored warfare proved to be a tactical success , as the romanian ##s destroyed 127 soviet tanks for the cost of their 100 lost units . [SEP]
[CLS] romanian forces destroyed 62 soviet tanks on 20 november for the cost of 25 tanks of their own , followed by 65 more soviet tanks on 22 november , for the cost of 10 tanks of their own . [SEP]
[CLS] more soviet tanks were destroyed as they over ##ran the romanian airfields . [SEP]
[CLS] this was accomplished by romanian vickers / res ##ita 75 mm anti - aircraft guns , which proved effective against soviet armor . [SEP]
[CLS] the battle for the german - romanian airfield at ka ##rp ##ova lasted two days , with romanian gunners destroying numerous soviet tanks . [SEP]

[CLS] 95 ##5 soviet civilians died in stalin ##grad and its suburbs from aerial bombing by " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte " 4 as the german 4th panzer and 6th armies approached the city . [SEP]
[CLS] the losses of transport planes were especially serious , as they destroyed the capacity for supply of the trapped 6th army . [SEP]
[CLS] the destruction of 72 aircraft when the airfield at ta ##ts ##ins ##kaya was overrun meant the loss of about 10 percent of the luftwaffe transport fleet . [SEP]
[CLS] these losses amounted to about 50 percent of the aircraft committed and the luftwaffe training program was stopped and sort ##ies in other theaters of war were significantly reduced to save fuel for use at stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] the events of the battle for stalin ##grad have been covered in numerous media works of british , american , german , and russian origin , for its significance as a turning point in the second world war and for the loss of life associated with the battle . [SEP]
[CLS] the term stalin ##grad has become almost synonymous with large - scale urban battles with high casualties on both sides . [SEP]
