[CLS] marked by fierce close quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians in air raids , it was the largest ( nearly 2 . 2 million personnel ) and blood ##iest ( 1 . 8 – 2 million killed , wounded or captured ) battle in the history of warfare . [SEP]
[CLS] after their defeat at stalin ##grad , the german high command had to withdraw vast military forces from the western front to replace their losses . [SEP]
[CLS] the german offensive to capture stalin ##grad began in august 1942 , using the 6th army and elements of the 4th panzer army . [SEP]
[CLS] by mid - november 1942 , the germans had pushed the soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones along the west bank of the volga river . [SEP]
[CLS] on 19 november 1942 , the red army launched operation " ur ##anus " , a two - pro ##nged attack targeting the weaker romanian and hungarian armies protecting the german 6th army ' s flanks . [SEP]
[CLS] the axis forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th army was cut off and surrounded in the stalin ##grad area . [SEP]
[CLS] adolf hitler ordered that the army stay in stalin ##grad and make no attempt to break out ; instead , attempts were made to supply the army by air and to break the en ##ci ##rcle ##ment from the outside . [SEP]
[CLS] by the spring of 1942 , despite the failure of operation " bar ##bar ##ossa " to decisive ##ly defeat the soviet union in a single campaign , the wehrmacht had captured vast expanse ##s of territory , including ukraine , belarus , and the baltic republics . [SEP]
[CLS] elsewhere , the war had been progressing well : the u - boat offensive in the atlantic had been very successful and erwin rom ##mel had just captured to ##br ##uk . [SEP]
[CLS] hitler was confident that he could master the red army after the winter of 1942 , because even though army group centre ( " hee ##res ##gr ##uppe mit ##te " ) had suffered heavy losses west of moscow the previous winter , 65 % of its infantry had not been engaged and had been rested and re - equipped . [SEP]
[CLS] stalin was expecting the main thrust of the german summer attacks to be directed against moscow again . [SEP]
[CLS] with the initial operations being very successful , the germans decided that their summer campaign in 1942 would be directed at the southern parts of the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial objectives in the region around stalin ##grad were the destruction of the industrial capacity of the city and the deployment of forces to block the volga river . [SEP]
[CLS] the river was a key route from the caucasus and the caspian sea to central russia . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans cut the pipeline from the oil ##fields when they captured ro ##stov on 23 july . [SEP]
[CLS] on 23 july 1942 , hitler personally re ##wr ##ote the operational objectives for the 1942 campaign , greatly expanding them to include the occupation of the city of stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] both sides began to attach propaganda value to the city , based on it bearing the name of the leader of the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] hitler proclaimed that after stalin ##grad ' s capture , its male citizens were to be killed and all women and children were to be deported because its population was " thoroughly communist ##ic " and " especially dangerous " . [SEP]
[CLS] it was assumed that the fall of the city would also firmly secure the northern and western flanks of the german armies as they advanced on baku , with the aim of securing these strategic petroleum resources for germany . [SEP]
[CLS] they ordered that anyone strong enough to hold a rifle be sent to fight . [SEP]
[CLS] army group south was selected for a sprint forward through the southern russian steppe ##s into the caucasus to capture the vital soviet oil fields there . [SEP]
[CLS] the planned summer offensive , code - named " fall b ##lau " ( case blue ) , was to include the german 6th , 17th , 4th panzer and 1st panzer armies . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a number of german and romanian units that were to take part in " b ##lau " were be ##sie ##ging se ##vas ##top ##ol on the crimean peninsula . [SEP]
[CLS] delays in ending the siege pushed back the start date for " b ##lau " several times , and the city did not fall until early july . [SEP]
[CLS] operation fr ##ider ##icus i by the germans against the " is ##ium bulge " , pinched off the soviet sal ##ient in the second battle of k ##har ##kov , and resulted in the en ##vel ##op ##ment of a large soviet force between 17 may and 29 may . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial advance of the 6th army was so successful that hitler intervened and ordered the 4th panzer army to join army group south ( a ) to the south . [SEP]
[CLS] a massive traffic jam resulted when the 4th panzer and the 1st panzer both required the few roads in the area . [SEP]
[CLS] with the advance now slowed , hitler changed his mind and reassigned the 4th panzer army back to the attack on stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of july , the germans had pushed the soviets across the don river . [SEP]
[CLS] at this point , the don and volga rivers are only 65 km apart , and the germans left their main supply depot ##s west of the don , which had important implications later in the course of the battle . [SEP]
[CLS] italian forces were generally held in little regard by the germans , and were accused of having low morale : in reality , the italian divisions fought comparatively well , with the 3rd mountain infantry division raven ##na and 5th infantry division co ##sser ##ia proving to have good morale , according to a german liaison officer , and were forced to retreat only after a massive armoured attack in which german reinforcements had failed to arrive in time , according to a german historian . [SEP]
[CLS] on 25 july the germans faced stiff resistance with a soviet bridge ##head west of kala ##ch . [SEP]
[CLS] " we had had to pay a high cost in men and material . . . left on the kala ##tch battlefield were numerous burnt - out or shot - up german tanks . " [SEP]
[CLS] the german 6th army was only a few dozen kilometers from stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] the 4th panzer army , ordered south on 13 july to block the soviet retreat " weakened by the 17th army and the 1st panzer army " , had turned northwards to help take the city from the south . [SEP]
[CLS] to the south , army group a was pushing far into the caucasus , but their advance slowed as supply lines grew over ##ex ##ten ##ded . [SEP]
[CLS] the two german army groups were not positioned to support one another due to the great distances involved . [SEP]
[CLS] after german intentions became clear in july 1942 , stalin appointed general andrey yer ##yo ##men ##ko as commander of the southeastern front on 1 august 1942 . [SEP]
[CLS] these units became the newly formed 62 ##nd army , which yer ##yo ##men ##ko placed under the command of lieutenant general va ##sil ##iy chu ##iko ##v on 11 september 1942 . [SEP]
[CLS] chu ##iko ##v ' s generals ##hip during the battle earned him one of his two hero of the soviet union awards . [SEP]
[CLS] david g ##lan ##tz indicated that four hard - fought battles – collectively known as the ko ##tl ##uba ##n operations – north of stalin ##grad , where the soviets made their greatest stand , decided germany ' s fate before the nazis ever set foot in the city itself , and were a turning point in the war . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets had enough warning of the german advance to ship grain , cattle , and railway cars across the volga and out of harm ' s way , but most civilian residents were not evacuated . [SEP]
[CLS] before the " hee ##r " reached the city itself , the " luftwaffe " had rendered the river volga , vital for bringing supplies into the city , un ##usa ##ble to soviet shipping . [SEP]
[CLS] the battle began with the heavy bombing of the city by " general ##obe ##rst " wolf ##ram von rich ##th ##of ##en ' s " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte 4 " , which in the summer and autumn of 1942 was the single most powerful air formation in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] the exact number of civilians killed during the course of the battle is unknown but was most likely very high . [SEP]
[CLS] around 40 , 000 civilians were moved to germany as slave workers , some fled the city during battle and a small number were evacuated by the soviets . [SEP]
[CLS] the 36 ##9th ( croatian ) reinforced infantry regiment was the only non - german unit selected by the " wehrmacht " to enter stalin ##grad city during assault operations . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been said that stalin prevented civilians from leaving the city in the belief that their presence would encourage greater resistance from the city ' s defenders . [SEP]
[CLS] ninety percent of the living space in the vo ##ros ##hil ##ov ##ski ##y area was destroyed . [SEP]
[CLS] between 23 and 26 august , soviet reports indicate 95 ##5 people were killed and another 1 , 181 wounded as a result of the bombing . [SEP]
[CLS] the v ##vs bases in the immediate area lost 201 aircraft between 23 and 31 august , and despite me ##ager reinforcements of some 100 aircraft in august , it was left with just 192 service ##able aircraft , 57 of which were fighters . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets continued to pour aerial reinforcements into the stalin ##grad area in late september , but continued to suffer app ##all ##ing losses ; the " luftwaffe " had complete control of the skies . [SEP]
[CLS] the burden of the initial defense of the city fell on the 107 ##7th anti - aircraft regiment , a unit made up mainly of young female volunteers who had no training for engaging ground targets . [SEP]
[CLS] despite this , and with no support available from other units , the aa gunners stayed at their posts and took on the advancing panzer ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the german 16th panzer division reportedly had to fight the 107 ##7th ' s gunners " shot for shot " until all 37 anti - aircraft guns were destroyed or overrun . [SEP]
[CLS] the 16th panzer was shocked to find that , due to soviet manpower shortages , it had been fighting female soldiers . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early stages of the battle , the nk ##vd organized poorly armed " workers ' militias " similar to those that had defended the city twenty - four years earlier , composed of civilians not directly involved in war production for immediate use in the battle . [SEP]
[CLS] these tanks , un ##pa ##int ##ed and lacking guns ##ight ##s , were driven directly from the factory floor to the front line . [SEP]
[CLS] another advance to the river south of the city followed , while the soviets abandoned their ross ##osh ##ka position for the inner defensive ring west of stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] the wings of the 6th army and the 4th panzer army met near ja ##bl ##ot ##ch ##ni along the za ##rit ##za on 2 sept . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1 september , the soviets could only reinforce and supply their forces in stalin ##grad by per ##ilo ##us crossings of the volga under constant bombardment by artillery and aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] on 18 september , the soviet 1st guards and 24th army launched an offensive against viii army corps at ko ##tl ##uba ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] amid the debris of the wrecked city , the soviet 62 ##nd and 64 ##th armies , which included the soviet 13th guards rifle division , anchored their defense lines with strong ##points in houses and factories . [SEP]
[CLS] lieutenant general alexander rod ##im ##ts ##ev was in charge of the 13th guards rifle division , and received one of two heroes of the soviet union awarded during the battle for his actions . [SEP]
[CLS] desert ##ers and presumed mali ##nger ##ers were captured or executed after fighting . during the battle the 62 ##nd army had the most arrests and executions : 203 in all , of which 49 were executed , while 139 were sent to penal companies and battalions . the germans pushing forward into stalin ##grad suffered heavy casualties . [SEP]
[CLS] the remaining tanks were used as im ##mobile strong ##points within the city . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial german attack on 14 september attempted to take the city in a rush . [SEP]
[CLS] the 51st army corps ' 295 ##th infantry division went after the mama ##yev ku ##rgan hill , the 71 ##st attacked the central rail station and toward the central landing stage on the volga , while 48th panzer corps attacked south of the tsar ##its ##a river . [SEP]
[CLS] rod ##im ##ts ##ev ' s 13th guards rifle division had been hurried up to cross the river and join the defenders inside the city . [SEP]
[CLS] though initially successful , the german attacks stalled in the face of soviet reinforcements brought in from across the volga . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet 13th guards rifle division , assigned to counterattack at the mama ##yev ku ##rgan and at railway station no . [SEP]
[CLS] over 30 percent of its soldiers were killed in the first 24 hours , and just 320 out of the original 10 , 000 survived the entire battle . [SEP]
[CLS] by the following evening , the 13th guards rifle division had ceased to exist . [SEP]
[CLS] combat raged for three days at the giant grain elevator in the south of the city . [SEP]
[CLS] only forty dead soviet fighters were found , though the germans had thought there were many more due to the intensity of resistance . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets burned large amounts of grain during their retreat in order to deny the enemy food . [SEP]
[CLS] paul ##us chose the grain elevator and si ##los as the symbol of stalin ##grad for a patch he was having designed to commemorate the battle after a german victory . [SEP]
[CLS] some soviet commanders adopted the tactic of always keeping their front - line positions as close to the germans as physically possible ; chu ##iko ##v called this " hugging " the germans . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , they converted multi - floor ##ed apartment blocks , factories , warehouses , street corner residences and office buildings into a series of well defended strong ##points with small 5 – 10 man units . [SEP]
[CLS] manpower in the city was constantly ref ##resh ##ed by bringing additional troops over the volga . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans called this unseen urban warfare " rat ##ten ##kr ##ieg " ( " rat war " ) , and bitterly joked about capturing the kitchen but still fighting for the living room and the bedroom . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the taller buildings , blasted into roof ##less shells by earlier german aerial bombardment , saw floor - by - floor , close quarters combat , with the germans and soviets on alternate levels , firing at each other through holes in the floors . [SEP]
[CLS] fighting on and around mama ##yev ku ##rgan , a prominent hill above the city , was particularly mer ##ci ##less ; indeed , the position changed hands many times . [SEP]
[CLS] in another part of the city , a soviet platoon under the command of sergeant ya ##kov pa ##v ##lov fortified a four - story building that oversaw a square 300 meters from the river bank , later called " pa ##v ##lov ' s house " . [SEP]
[CLS] the soldiers surrounded it with mine ##fields , set up machine - gun positions at the windows and breached the walls in the basement for better communications . [SEP]
[CLS] positions were taken individually , but the germans were never able to capture the key crossing points along the river bank . [SEP]
[CLS] by 27 sept . the germans occupied the southern portion of the city , but the soviets held the center and northern part . [SEP]
[CLS] most importantly , the soviets controlled the ferries to their supplies on the east bank of the volga . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans used air ##power , tanks and heavy artillery to clear the city with varying degrees of success . [SEP]
[CLS] toward the end of the battle , the gigantic railroad gun nicknamed " dora " was brought into the area . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets built up a large number of artillery batteries on the east bank of the volga . [SEP]
[CLS] sniper ##s on both sides used the ruins to in ##flict casualties . [SEP]
[CLS] the most famous soviet sniper in stalin ##grad was va ##sily za ##yt ##se ##v , with 225 confirmed kills during the battle . [SEP]
[CLS] the british historian antony bee ##vor noted the " sinister " message from the stalin ##grad front ' s political department on 8 october 1942 that : " the defeat ##ist mood is almost eliminated and the number of treason ##ous incidents is getting lower " as an example of the sort of coe ##rc ##ion red army soldiers experienced under the special detachments ( later to be renamed sm ##ers ##h ) . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , bee ##vor noted the often extraordinary bravery of the soviet soldiers in a battle that was only comparable to ve ##rd ##un , and argued that terror alone cannot explain such self - sacrifice . [SEP]
[CLS] he argues that , though it is " easy to argue that from the summer of 1942 the soviet army fought because it was forced to fight , " to concentrate solely on coe ##rc ##ion is nonetheless to " di ##stor ##t our view of the soviet war effort . " [SEP]
[CLS] after conducting hundreds of interviews with soviet veterans on the subject of terror on the eastern front – and specifically about order no . [SEP]
[CLS] many women fought on the soviet side , or were under fire . [SEP]
[CLS] as general chu ##iko ##v acknowledged , " remembering the defence of stalin ##grad , i can ' t overlook the very important question . . . about the role of women in war , in the rear , but also at the front . [SEP]
[CLS] at the beginning of the battle there were 75 , 000 women and girls from the stalin ##grad area who had finished military or medical training , and all of whom were to serve in the battle . [SEP]
[CLS] soviet nurses not only treated wounded personnel under fire but were involved in the highly dangerous work of bringing wounded soldiers back to the hospitals under enemy fire . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the soviet wireless and telephone operators were women who often suffered heavy casualties when their command posts came under fire . [SEP]
[CLS] at least three women won the title hero of the soviet union while driving tanks at stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] for both stalin and hitler , stalin ##grad became a matter of prestige far beyond its strategic significance . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet command moved units from the red army strategic reserve in the moscow area to the lower volga , and transferred aircraft from the entire country to the stalin ##grad region . [SEP]
[CLS] the strain on both military commanders was immense : paul ##us developed an un ##con ##tro ##lla ##ble ti ##c in his eye , which eventually af ##flict ##ed the left side of his face , while chu ##iko ##v experienced an outbreak of ec ##ze ##ma that required him to have his hands completely bandage ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] after 27 september , much of the fighting in the city shifted north to the industrial district . [SEP]
[CLS] it took a few more days for them to prepare for the most savage offensive of all , which was unleashed on 14 october with a concentration of gunfire never seen before . [SEP]
[CLS] exceptionally intense shell ##ing and bombing paved the way for the first german assault groups . [SEP]
[CLS] the main attack ( led by the 14th panzer and 305 ##th infantry divisions ) attacked towards the tractor factory , while another assault led by the 24th panzer division hit to the south of the giant plant . [SEP]
[CLS] the german onslaught crushed the 37th guards rifle division and in the afternoon the forward assault group reached the tractor factory before arriving at the volga river , splitting the 62 ##nd army into two . [SEP]
[CLS] fighting raged inside the barr ##ika ##dy factory until the end of october . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet - controlled area sh ##rank down to a few strips of land along the western bank of the volga , and in november the fighting concentrated around what soviet newspapers referred to as " l ##yu ##d ##nikov ' s island " , a small patch of ground behind the barr ##ika ##dy factory where the remnants of colonel ivan l ##yu ##d ##nikov ' s 138 ##th rifle division resisted all ferocious assaults thrown by the germans and became a symbol of the stout soviet defense of stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] determined to crush soviet resistance , " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte " 4 ' s " stu ##kawa ##ffe " flew 900 individual sort ##ies against soviet positions at the " d ##zer ##zhi ##nsk ##iy " tractor factory on 5 october . [SEP]
[CLS] several soviet regiments were wiped out ; the entire staff of the soviet 339 ##th infantry regiment was killed the following morning during an air raid . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the combination of constant air support operations on the german side and the soviet surrender of the daytime skies began to affect the strategic balance in the air . [SEP]
[CLS] soviet offensive ##s in the central and northern portions of the eastern front tied down luftwaffe reserves and newly built aircraft , reducing " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte " 4 ' s percentage of eastern front aircraft from 60 percent on 28 june to 38 percent by 20 september . [SEP]
[CLS] in mid - october , after receiving reinforcements from the caucasus theater , the " luftwaffe " intensified its efforts against remaining red army positions holding the west bank . [SEP]
[CLS] " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte " 4 flew 1 , 250 sort ##ies on 14 october and its stu ##kas dropped 550 tonnes of bombs , while german infantry surrounded the three factories . [SEP]
[CLS] " stu ##ka ##ges ##ch ##wad ##er " 1 , 2 , and 77 had largely silenced soviet artillery on the eastern bank of the volga before turning their attention to the shipping that was once again trying to reinforce the narrowing soviet pockets of resistance . [SEP]
[CLS] the 62 ##nd army had been cut in two and , due to intensive air attack on its supply ferries , was receiving much less material support . [SEP]
[CLS] with the soviets forced into a 1 km strip of land on the western bank of the volga , over 1 , 208 " stu ##ka " missions were flown in an effort to eliminate them . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet bomber force , the " av ##ia ##ts ##iya dal ' ne ##go de ##yst ##vi ##ya " ( long range aviation ; add ) , having taken cr ##ip ##pling losses over the past 18 months , was restricted to flying at night . [SEP]
[CLS] the german air arm found itself spread thin ##ly across europe , struggling to maintain its strength in the other southern sectors of the soviet - german front . [SEP]
[CLS] as historian chris bellamy notes , the germans paid a high strategic price for the aircraft sent into stalin ##grad : the " luftwaffe " was forced to divert much of its air strength away from the oil - rich caucasus , which had been hitler ' s original grand - strategic objective . [SEP]
[CLS] the romanian air force lost 79 aircraft , most of them captured on the ground along with their airfields . [SEP]
[CLS] after three months of slow advance , the germans finally reached the river banks , capturing 90 % of the ruined city and splitting the remaining soviet forces into two narrow pockets . [SEP]
[CLS] ice fl ##oes on the volga now prevented boats and tugs from supplying the soviet defenders . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , the fighting continued , especially on the slopes of mama ##yev ku ##rgan and inside the factory area in the northern part of the city . [SEP]
[CLS] recognizing that german troops were ill - prepared for offensive operations during the winter of 1942 , and that most of them were red ##ep ##lo ##yed elsewhere on the southern sector of the eastern front , the st ##av ##ka decided to conduct a number of offensive operations between 19 november 1942 and 2 february 1943 . [SEP]
[CLS] according to zhu ##kov , " " german operational blu ##nder ##s were aggravated by poor intelligence : they failed to spot preparations for the major counter - offensive near stalin ##grad where there were 10 field , 1 tank and 4 air armies . " " [SEP]
[CLS] this resulted in a very thin line , with some sectors where 1 – stretches were being defended by a single platoon . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the total focus on the city , the axis forces had neglected for months to consolidate their positions along the natural defensive line of the don river . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet forces were allowed to retain bridge ##heads on the right bank from which offensive operations could be quickly launched . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , on the southern flank of the stalin ##grad sector the front southwest of ko ##tel ##nikov ##o was held only by the romanian 4th army . [SEP]
[CLS] according to paul ##us ' comments to adam , " there is still the order whereby no commander of an army group or an army has the right to re ##lin ##qui ##sh a village , even a trench , without hitler ' s consent . " [SEP]
[CLS] in autumn , the soviet generals georg ##y zhu ##kov and aleksandr va ##sil ##evsky , responsible for strategic planning in the stalin ##grad area , concentrated forces in the steppe ##s to the north and south of the city . [SEP]
[CLS] the armies in the area were also poorly equipped in terms of anti - tank weapons . [SEP]
[CLS] the plan was to punch through the overs ##tre ##tched and weakly defended german flanks and surround the german forces in the stalin ##grad region . [SEP]
[CLS] during the preparations for the attack , marshal zhu ##kov personally visited the front and noticing the poor organization , insisted on a one - week delay in the start date of the planned attack . [SEP]
[CLS] the plan was similar to the one zhu ##kov had used to achieve victory at k ##hal ##kh ##in go ##l three years before , where he had sprung a double en ##vel ##op ##ment and destroyed the 23rd division of the japanese army . [SEP]
[CLS] the attacking soviet units under the command of gen . nikolay va ##tu ##tin consisted of three complete armies , the 1st guards army , 5th tank army , and 21st army , including a total of 18 infantry divisions , eight tank brigades , two motorized brigades , six cavalry divisions and one anti - tank brigade . [SEP]
[CLS] the preparations for the attack could be heard by the romanian ##s , who continued to push for reinforcements , only to be refused again . [SEP]
[CLS] thin ##ly spread , deployed in exposed positions , outnumbered and poorly equipped , the romanian 3rd army , which held the northern flank of the german 6th army , was overrun . [SEP]
[CLS] behind the front lines , no preparations had been made to defend key points in the rear such as kala ##ch . [SEP]
[CLS] on 20 november , a second soviet offensive ( two armies ) was launched to the south of stalin ##grad against points held by the romanian 4th army corps . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet forces raced west and met on 23 november at the town of kala ##ch , sealing the ring around stalin ##grad . [SEP]
[CLS] the link - up of the soviet forces , not filmed at the time , was later re - enacted for a propaganda film which was shown worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , the german 6th army included between 40 , 000 and 65 , 000 " hi ##lf ##sw ##ill ##ige " ( " hi ##wi " ) , or " volunteer aux ##ilia ##ries " , a term used for personnel recruited amongst soviet pow ##s and civilians from areas under occupation . [SEP]
[CLS] " hi ##wi " often proved to be reliable axis personnel in rear areas and were used for supporting roles , but also served in some front ##line units as their numbers had increased . [SEP]
[CLS] inside the pocket ( , literally " ca ##uld ##ron " ) , there were also around 10 , 000 soviet civilians and several thousand soviet soldiers the germans had taken captive during the battle . [SEP]
[CLS] even with the desperate situation of the sixth army , army group a continued their invasion of the caucasus further south from 19 november until 19 december . [SEP]
[CLS] by 19 december the german army was in full retreat out of the caucasus , while using the sixth army to tie down the soviet forces . [SEP]
[CLS] hence army group a was never used to help relieve the sixth army . [SEP]
[CLS] under his command were the 20 german and 2 romanian divisions encircled at stalin ##grad , adam ' s battle groups formed along the chi ##r river and on the don bridge ##head , plus the remains of the romanian 3rd army . [SEP]
[CLS] field marshal erich von mans ##tein advised hitler not to order the 6th army to break out , stating that he could break through the soviet lines and relieve the besieged 6th army . [SEP]
[CLS] the american historians williamson murray and alan mill ##et wrote that it was mans ##tein ' s message to hitler on 24 november advising him that the 6th army should not break out , along with go ##ring ' s statements that the luftwaffe could supply stalin ##grad that " . . . sealed the fate of the sixth army . " [SEP]
[CLS] mans ##tein was tasked to conduct a relief operation , named operation winter storm ( " un ##tern ##eh ##men winter ##ge ##wi ##tter " ) against stalin ##grad , which he thought was feasible if the 6th army was temporarily supplied through the air . [SEP]
[CLS] adolf hitler had declared in a public speech ( in the berlin sport ##pala ##st ) on 30 september 1942 that the german army would never leave the city . [SEP]
[CLS] at a meeting shortly after the soviet en ##ci ##rcle ##ment , german army chiefs pushed for an immediate breakout to a new line on the west of the don , but hitler was at his bavarian retreat of obe ##rsa ##lz ##berg in be ##rch ##tes ##ga ##den with the head of the " luftwaffe " , hermann go ##ring . [SEP]
[CLS] when asked by hitler , go ##ring replied , after being convinced by hans je ##sch ##onne ##k , that the luftwaffe could supply the 6th army with an " air bridge . " [SEP]
[CLS] a similar plan had been used a year earlier at the dem ##yan ##sk pocket , albeit on a much smaller scale : a corps at dem ##yan ##sk rather than an entire army . [SEP]
[CLS] the director of " lu ##ft ##fl ##otte " 4 , wolf ##ram von rich ##th ##of ##en , tried to get this decision overturned . [SEP]
[CLS] the forces under the 6th army were almost twice as large as a regular german army unit , plus there was also a corps of the 4th panzer army trapped in the pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] the maximum 107 tonnes they could deliver a day – based on the number of available aircraft and with only the airfield at pit ##om ##nik to land at – was far less than the minimum 750 tonnes needed . [SEP]
[CLS] to supplement the limited number of junk ##ers ju 52 transports , the germans pressed other aircraft into the role , such as the he ##ink ##el he 177 bomber ( some bombers performed adequately – the he ##ink ##el he 111 proved to be quite capable and was much faster than the ju 52 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] general rich ##th ##of ##en informed mans ##tein on 27 november of the small transport capacity of the luftwaffe and the imp ##oss ##ibility of supplying 300 tons a day by air . [SEP]
[CLS] based on the information of the expert rich ##th ##of ##en , he declared that contrary to the example of the pocket of dem ##yan ##sk the permanent supply by air would be impossible . [SEP]
[CLS] if only a narrow link could be established to sixth army , he proposed that this should be used to pull it out from the en ##ci ##rcle ##ment , and said that the luftwaffe should instead of supplies deliver only enough ammunition and fuel for a breakout attempt . [SEP]
[CLS] he acknowledged the heavy moral sacrifice that giving up stalin ##grad would mean , but this would be made easier to bear by con ##ser ##ving the combat power of the sixth army and regaining the initiative . [SEP]
[CLS] hitler reiterated that the sixth army would stay at stalin ##grad and that the air bridge would supply it until the en ##ci ##rcle ##ment was broken by a new german offensive . [SEP]
[CLS] however , according to adam , " on not one single day have the minimal essential number of tons of supplies been flown in . " [SEP]
[CLS] the outcome of the airlift was the luftwaffe ' s failure to provide its transport units with the tools they needed to maintain an adequate count of operational aircraft – tools that included airfield facilities , supplies , manpower , and even aircraft suited to the prevailing conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] these factors , taken together , prevented the luftwaffe from effectively employing the full potential of its transport forces , ensuring that they were unable to deliver the quantity of supplies needed to sustain the 6th army . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early parts of the operation , fuel was shipped at a higher priority than food and ammunition because of a belief that there would be a breakout from the city . [SEP]
[CLS] on 23 december , the soviet 24th tank corps , commanded by major - general va ##sily mi ##kha ##yl ##ovich bad ##anov , reached nearby ska ##ssi ##rsk ##aya and in the early morning of 24 december , the tanks reached ta ##ts ##ins ##kaya . [SEP]
[CLS] without any soldiers to defend the airfield , it was abandoned under heavy fire ; in a little under an hour , 108 ju 52 ##s and 16 ju 86 ##s took off for novo ##cher ##kas ##sk – leaving 72 ju 52 ##s and many other aircraft burning on the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] a new base was established some 300 km from stalin ##grad at sal ##sk , the additional distance would become another obstacle to the res ##up ##ply efforts . [SEP]
[CLS] winter weather conditions , technical failures , heavy soviet anti - aircraft fire and fighter interceptions eventually led to the loss of 48 ##8 german aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] in spite of the failure of the german offensive to reach the 6th army , the air supply operation continued under ever more difficult circumstances . [SEP]
[CLS] after a few weeks on such a diet , he had " visibly lost weight " , according to albert sp ##eer , and hitler " commanded ze ##it ##ler to resume at once taking sufficient no ##uri ##sh ##ment . " [SEP]
[CLS] soviet forces consolidated their positions around stalin ##grad , and fierce fighting to shrink the pocket began . [SEP]
[CLS] operation winter storm ( " operation winter ##ge ##wi ##tter " ) , the german attempt led by erich von mans ##tein to relieve the trapped army from the south , was initially successful . [SEP]
[CLS] however the predictable nature of the relief operation brought significant risk for all german forces in the area . [SEP]
[CLS] the starving encircled forces at stalin ##grad made no attempt to break out or link up with mans ##tein ' s advance . [SEP]
[CLS] some german officers requested that paul ##us def ##y hitler ' s orders to stand fast and instead attempt to break out of the stalin ##grad pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] paul ##us refused , concerned about the red army attacks on the flank of army group don and army group b in their advance on ro ##stov - on - don , " an early abandonment " of stalin ##grad " would result in the destruction of army group a in the caucasus , " and the fact that his 6th army tanks only had fuel for a 30 km advance towards hot ##h ' s spear ##head , a futile effort if they did not receive assurance of res ##up ##ply by air . [SEP]
[CLS] on 16 december , the soviets launched operation little saturn , which attempted to punch through the axis army ( mainly italians ) on the don and take ro ##stov . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans set up a " mobile defense " of small units that were to hold towns until supporting armor arrived . [SEP]
[CLS] from the soviet bridge ##head at ma ##mon , 15 divisions – supported by at least 100 tanks – attacked the italian co ##sser ##ia and raven ##na divisions , and although outnumbered 9 to 1 , the italians initially fought well , with the germans praising the quality of the italian defenders , but on 19 december , with the italian lines di ##sin ##te ##grating , arm ##ir headquarters ordered the battered divisions to withdraw to new lines . [SEP]
[CLS] sensing that this was the last chance for a breakout , mans ##tein pleaded with hitler on 18 december , but hitler refused . [SEP]
[CLS] the 6th army now was beyond all hope of german relief . [SEP]
[CLS] while a motor ##ised breakout might have been possible in the first few weeks , the 6th army now had insufficient fuel and the german soldiers would have faced great difficulty breaking through the soviet lines on foot in harsh winter conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] but in its defensive position on the volga , the 6th army continued to tie down a significant number of soviet armies . [SEP]
[CLS] as zhu ##kov states , " the military and political leadership of nazi germany sought not to relieve them , but to get them to fight on for as long possible so as to tie up the soviet forces . [SEP]
[CLS] the red army high command sent three envoy ##s while simultaneously aircraft and loud ##sp ##eak ##ers announced terms of cap ##it ##ulation on 7 january 1943 . [SEP]
[CLS] a low - level soviet envoy party ( comprising major aleksandr sm ##ys ##lov , captain nikolay d ##yat ##len ##ko and a trumpeter ) carried an offer to paul ##us : if he surrendered within 24 hours , he would receive a guarantee of safety for all prisoners , medical care for the sick and wounded , prisoners being allowed to keep their personal belongings , " normal " food rations , and rep ##at ##riation to any country they wished after the war ; but paul ##us – ordered not to surrender by hitler – did not respond . [SEP]
[CLS] the german high command informed paul ##us , " every day that the army holds out longer helps the whole front and draws away the russian divisions from it . " [SEP]
[CLS] the germans inside the pocket retreated from the suburbs of stalin ##grad to the city itself . [SEP]
[CLS] the third and last service ##able runway was at the stalin ##grad ##skaya flight school , which reportedly had the last landings and takeoff ##s on 23 january . [SEP]
[CLS] in particular , the so - called " hi ##wi ##s " , soviet citizens fighting for the germans , had no illusions about their fate if captured . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets were initially surprised by the number of germans they had trapped , and had to reinforce their en ##ci ##rc ##ling troops . [SEP]
[CLS] bloody urban warfare began again in stalin ##grad , but this time it was the germans who were pushed back to the banks of the volga . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets did not bother employing tanks in areas where the urban destruction restricted their mobility . [SEP]
[CLS] hitler rejected it on a point of honour . [SEP]

" [SEP]
[CLS] no german field marshal had ever surrendered , and the implication was clear : if paul ##us surrendered , he would shame himself and would become the highest ranking german officer ever to be captured . [SEP]
[CLS] general schmidt negotiated a surrender of the headquarters while paul ##us was unaware in another room . [SEP]
[CLS] when inter ##rogated by the soviets , paul ##us claimed that he had not surrendered . [SEP]
[CLS] he denied that he was the commander of the remaining northern pocket in stalin ##grad and refused to issue an order in his name for them to surrender . [SEP]
[CLS] the central pocket , under the command of he ##itz , surrendered the same day , while the northern pocket , under the command of karl st ##re ##cker , held out for two more days . [SEP]
[CLS] when st ##re ##cker finally surrendered he and his chief of staff , helmut ##h gr ##os ##cu ##rth , drafted the final signal sent from stalin ##grad , purposely om ##itt ##ing the customary ex ##cl ##ama ##tion to hitler , replacing it with " long live germany ! " [SEP]
[CLS] at four in the morning on 2 february , general st ##re ##cker was informed that one of his own officers had gone to the soviets to negotiate surrender terms . [SEP]
[CLS] hitler was furious and con ##fide ##d that paul ##us " " could have freed himself from all sorrow and ascended into eternity and national immortality , but he prefers to go to moscow . " " [SEP]

[CLS] a year of german gains during case blue had been wiped out . [SEP]
[CLS] germany ' s sixth army had ceased to exist , and the forces of germany ' s european allies , except finland , had been shattered . [SEP]
[CLS] in a speech on 9 november 1944 , hitler himself blamed stalin ##grad for germany ' s impending doom . [SEP]
[CLS] the destruction of an entire army ( the largest killed , captured , wounded figures for axis soldiers , nearly 1 million , during the war ) and the frustration of germany ' s grand strategy made the battle a watershed moment . [SEP]
[CLS] germany ' s defeat shattered its reputation for in ##vin ##ci ##bility and dealt a devastating blow to german morale . [SEP]
