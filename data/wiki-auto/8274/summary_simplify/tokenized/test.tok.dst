[CLS] it is in the form of a letter in latin submitted to pope john xx ##ii , dated 6 april 132 ##0 , intended to confirm scotland ' s status as an independent , sovereign state and defending scotland ' s right to use military action when un ##just ##ly attacked . [SEP]
[CLS] the declaration was part of a broader diplomatic campaign which sought to assert scotland ' s position as an independent kingdom , rather than being a feudal land controlled by england ' s norman kings , as well as lift the ex ##com ##mun ##ication of robert the bruce . [SEP]
[CLS] the pope had recognised edward i of england ' s claim to over ##lord ##ship of scotland in 130 ##5 and bruce was ex ##com ##mun ##icated by the pope for murdering john com ##yn before the altar in grey ##fr ##ia ##rs church in du ##m ##fr ##ies in 130 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] the declaration made a number of points : that scotland had always been independent , indeed for longer than england ; that edward i of england had un ##just ##ly attacked scotland and per ##pet ##rated atrocities ; that robert the bruce had delivered the scottish nation from this per ##il ; and , most controversial ##ly , that the independence of scotland was the pre ##ro ##gative of the scottish people , rather than the king of scots . [SEP]
[CLS] some have interpreted this last point as an early expression of ' popular sovereignty ' – that government is contractual and that kings can be chosen by the community rather than by god alone . [SEP]
[CLS] modern scottish nationalists point to the “ declaration " as evidence of the long - term persistence of the scots as a distinct national community , giving a very early date for the emergence of nationalism . [SEP]
[CLS] the meaning ascribed to words similar to nation during the ancient and medieval periods was often quite different than it is today . " [SEP]
[CLS] it has also been argued that the declaration was not a statement of popular sovereignty ( and that its sign ##ator ##ies would have had no such concept ) but a statement of royal propaganda supporting bruce ' s faction . [SEP]
[CLS] a justification had to be given for the rejection of king john ball ##iol in whose name william wallace and andrew de mora ##y had rebelled in 129 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] the reason given in the declaration is that bruce was able to defend scotland from english aggression whereas , by implication , king john could not . [SEP]
[CLS] whatever the true motive , the idea of a contract between king and people was advanced to the pope as a justification for bruce ' s coronation whilst john de ball ##iol still lived in papal custody . [SEP]
[CLS] there are 39 names — eight earls and thirty one barons — at the start of the document , all of whom may have had their seals app ##ended , probably over the space of some weeks and months , with nobles sending in their seals to be used . [SEP]
[CLS] on the extant copy of the declaration there are only 19 seals , and of those 19 people only 12 are named within the document . [SEP]
[CLS] the pope hee ##ded the arguments contained in the declaration , influenced by the offer of support from the scots for his long - desired crusade if they no longer had to fear english invasion . [SEP]
[CLS] eight months later , in october 132 ##8 , the inter ##dict on scotland , and the ex ##com ##mun ##ication of its king , were removed by the pope . [SEP]
[CLS] a copy of the declaration survives among scotland ' s state papers , held by the national archives of scotland in edinburgh . [SEP]
[CLS] the most widely known english language translation was made by sir james fergus ##son , formerly keeper of the records of scotland , from text that he reconstructed using this extant copy and early copies of the original draft . [SEP]
[CLS] although it includes several consistent bruce loyalists , it includes others who had opposed bruce , or whom bruce tried for plotting against him a few months later , and others of whom little is known . [SEP]
[CLS] it uses the latin versions of the sign ##ator ##ies ' titles , and in some cases the spelling of names has changed over the years . [SEP]
[CLS] us senate resolution 155 of 10 november 1997 states that the declaration of ar ##bro ##ath , the scottish declaration of independence sic , was signed on 6 april 132 ##0 and the american declaration of independence was modelled on that inspirational document . [SEP]
