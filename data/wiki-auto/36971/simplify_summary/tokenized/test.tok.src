[CLS] the arctic ( or ) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of earth . [SEP]
[CLS] the arctic consists of the arctic ocean , adjacent seas , and parts of alaska ( united states ) , finland , greenland ( denmark ) , iceland , northern canada , norway , russia and sweden . [SEP]
[CLS] land within the arctic region has seasonal ##ly varying snow and ice cover , with predominantly tree ##less per ##ma ##fr ##ost ( permanently frozen underground ice ) - containing tun ##dra . [SEP]
[CLS] arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places . [SEP]
[CLS] the arctic region is a unique area among earth ' s ecosystems . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the cultures in the region and the arctic indigenous peoples have adapted to its cold and extreme conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] life in the arctic includes organisms living in the ice , zoo ##pl ##an ##kt ##on and ph ##yt ##op ##lan ##kt ##on , fish and marine mammals , birds , land animals , plants and human societies . [SEP]
[CLS] arctic land is bordered by the sub ##ar ##ctic . [SEP]
[CLS] the word arctic comes from the greek word ( " ark ##ti ##kos " ) , " near the bear , northern " and that from the word ( " ark ##tos " ) , meaning bear . [SEP]
[CLS] the name refers either to the constellation ur ##sa major , the " great bear " , which is prominent in the northern portion of the celestial sphere , or to the constellation ur ##sa minor , the " little bear " , which contains polar ##is , the pole star , also known as the north star . [SEP]
[CLS] there are a number of definitions of what area is contained within the arctic . [SEP]
[CLS] the area can be defined as north of the arctic circle ( 66 ##° 33 ' n ) , the approximate southern limit of the midnight sun and the polar night . [SEP]
[CLS] another definition of the arctic is the region where the average temperature for the warm ##est month ( july ) is below 10 °c ; the northernmost tree line roughly follows the iso ##ther ##m at the boundary of this region . [SEP]
[CLS] the arctic ' s climate is characterized by cold winters and cool summers . [SEP]
[CLS] its precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow and is low , with most of the area receiving less than 50 cm . [SEP]
[CLS] high winds often stir up snow , creating the illusion of continuous snowfall . [SEP]
[CLS] average winter temperatures can go as low as - 40 c , and the cold ##est recorded temperature is approximately - 68 c . [SEP]
[CLS] coastal arctic climates are moderate ##d by oceanic influences , having generally warmer temperatures and heavier snowfall ##s than the colder and dr ##ier interior areas . [SEP]
[CLS] the arctic is affected by current global warming , leading to arctic sea ice shrink ##age , diminished ice in the greenland ice sheet , and arctic methane release as the per ##ma ##fr ##ost tha ##ws . [SEP]
[CLS] due to the pole ##ward migration of the planet ' s iso ##ther ##ms ( about 35 mi per decade during the past 30 years as a consequence of global warming ) , the arctic region ( as defined by tree line and temperature ) is currently shrinking . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps the most alarm ##ing result of this is arctic sea ice shrink ##age . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a large variance in predictions of arctic sea ice loss , with models showing near - complete to complete loss in september from 204 ##0 to some time well beyond 210 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] about half of the analyzed models show near - complete to complete sea ice loss in september by the year 210 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] arctic life is characterized by adaptation to short growing seasons with long periods of sunlight , and to cold , dark , snow - covered winter conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] arctic vegetation is composed of plants such as dwarf shrubs , gram ##ino ##ids , herbs , li ##chen ##s , and moss ##es , which all grow relatively close to the ground , forming tun ##dra . [SEP]
[CLS] an example of a dwarf shrub is the bear ##berry . [SEP]
[CLS] as one moves northward , the amount of warmth available for plant growth decreases considerably . [SEP]
[CLS] in the northernmost areas , plants are at their metabolic limits , and small differences in the total amount of summer warmth make large differences in the amount of energy available for maintenance , growth and reproduction . [SEP]
[CLS] colder summer temperatures cause the size , abundance , productivity and variety of plants to decrease . [SEP]
[CLS] trees cannot grow in the arctic , but in its warm ##est parts , shrubs are common and can reach 2 m in height ; se ##dge ##s , moss ##es and li ##chen ##s can form thick layers . [SEP]
[CLS] in the cold ##est parts of the arctic , much of the ground is bare ; non - vascular plants such as li ##chen ##s and moss ##es pre ##dom ##inate , along with a few scattered grasses and for ##bs ( like the arctic poppy ) . [SEP]
[CLS] herb ##ivo ##res on the tun ##dra include the arctic hare , le ##mming , mu ##sko ##x , and car ##ib ##ou . [SEP]
[CLS] they are prey ##ed on by the snowy owl , arctic fox , gr ##izzly bear , and arctic wolf . [SEP]
[CLS] the polar bear is also a predator , though it prefers to hunt for marine life from the ice . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also many and marine species endemic to the colder regions . [SEP]
[CLS] other terrestrial animals include wolverine ##s , moose , dal ##l sheep , er ##mine ##s , and arctic ground squirrels . [SEP]
[CLS] marine mammals include seals , wal ##rus , and several species of ce ##ta ##cea ##n — bal ##een whales and also na ##r ##w ##hal ##s , killer whales , and bel ##uga ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] an excellent and famous example of a ring species exists and has been described around the arctic circle in the form of the " la ##rus " gu ##lls . [SEP]
[CLS] the arctic includes sizable natural resources ( oil , gas , minerals , fresh water , fish and if the sub ##ar ##ctic is included , forest ) to which modern technology and the economic opening up of russia have given significant new opportunities . [SEP]
[CLS] the interest of the tourism industry is also on the increase . [SEP]
[CLS] the arctic contains some of the last and most extensive continuous wilderness areas in the world , and its significance in preserving biodiversity and gen ##otype ##s is considerable . [SEP]
[CLS] the increasing presence of humans fragments vital habitats . [SEP]
[CLS] the arctic is particularly susceptible to the ab ##ras ##ion of ground ##co ##ver and to the disturbance of the rare breeding grounds of the animals that are characteristic to the region . [SEP]
[CLS] the arctic also holds 1 / 5 of the earth ' s water supply . [SEP]
[CLS] during the cretaceous time period , the arctic still had seasonal snow ##s , though only a light dustin ##g and not enough to permanently hind ##er plant growth . [SEP]
[CLS] animals such as the " cha ##smo ##saurus " , " h ##yp ##ac ##ros ##aurus " , " tr ##ood ##on " , and " ed ##mont ##osaurus " may have all migrated north to take advantage of the summer growing season , and migrated south to warmer cl ##ime ##s when the winter came . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar situation may also have been found amongst dinosaurs that lived in antarctic regions , such as the " mu ##tta ##bu ##rra ##saurus " of australia . [SEP]
[CLS] however , others claim that dinosaurs lived year - round at very high latitude ##s , such as near the col ##ville river , which is now at about 70 ##° n but at the time ( 70 million years ago ) was 10 ##° further north . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest inhabitants of north america ' s central and eastern arctic are referred to as the arctic small tool tradition ( as ##t ) and existed c . 2500 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] as ##t consisted of several pale ##o - es ##kim ##o cultures , including the independence cultures and pre - dorset culture . [SEP]
[CLS] the dorset culture ( in ##uk ##ti ##tu ##t : " tun ##ii ##t " or " tun ##it " ) refers to the next inhabitants of central and eastern arctic . [SEP]
[CLS] the dorset culture evolved because of technological and economic changes during the period of 105 ##0 – 550 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] with the exception of the quebec / labrador peninsula , the dorset culture vanished around 1500 ad . [SEP]
[CLS] supported by genetic testing , evidence shows that descendants of the dorset culture , known as the sadler ##mi ##ut , survived in ai ##vili ##k , southampton and coats islands , until the beginning of the 20th century . [SEP]
[CLS] the dorset / th ##ule culture transition dates around the 9th – 10th centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] scientists theo ##rize that there may have been cross - contact of the two cultures with sharing of technology , such as fashion ##ing harp ##oon heads , or the th ##ule may have found dorset remnants and adapted their ways with the predecessor culture . [SEP]
[CLS] others believe the th ##ule displaced the dorset . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1300 , the inuit , present - day arctic inhabitants and descendants of th ##ule culture , had settled in west greenland , and moved into east greenland over the following century . [SEP]
[CLS] over time , the inuit have migrated throughout the arctic regions of canada , greenland , russia , and the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] other ci ##rc ##ump ##olar north indigenous peoples include the chu ##k ##chi , even ##ks , in ##up ##ia ##t , khan ##ty , ko ##rya ##ks , ne ##nets , sami , yu ##ka ##ghi ##r , g ##wich ' in , and yu ##pi ##k . [SEP]
[CLS] the eight arctic nations ( canada , kingdom of denmark greenland & the far ##oe islands , finland , iceland , norway , sweden , russia , and usa ) are all members of the arctic council , as are organizations representing six indigenous populations . [SEP]
[CLS] the council operates on consensus basis , mostly dealing with environmental treaties and not addressing boundary or resource disputes . [SEP]
[CLS] though arctic policy priorities differ , every arctic nation is concerned about sovereignty / defense , resource development , shipping routes , and environmental protection . [SEP]
[CLS] much work remains on regulatory agreements regarding shipping , tourism , and resource development in arctic waters . [SEP]
[CLS] research in the arctic has long been a collaborative international effort , evidenced by the international polar year . [SEP]
[CLS] the international arctic science committee , hundreds of scientists and specialists of the arctic council , and the bare ##nts euro - arctic council are more examples of collaborative international arctic research . [SEP]
[CLS] no country owns the geographic north pole or the region of the arctic ocean surrounding it . [SEP]
[CLS] the surrounding six arctic states that border the arctic ocean — canada , kingdom of denmark ( with greenland ) , iceland , norway , russia , and the united states — are limited to a 200 nm exclusive economic zone ( ee ##z ) off their coasts . [SEP]
[CLS] two arctic states ( finland and sweden ) do not have direct access to the arctic ocean . [SEP]
[CLS] upon ratification of the united nations convention on the law of the sea , a country has ten years to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200 nautical mile zone . [SEP]
[CLS] due to this , norway ( which ratified the convention in 1996 ) , russia ( ratified in 1997 ) , canada ( ratified in 2003 ) and the kingdom of denmark ( ratified in 2004 ) launched projects to establish claims that certain sectors of the arctic sea ##bed should belong to their territories . [SEP]
[CLS] on 2 august 2007 , two russian bath ##ys ##cap ##hes , mir - 1 and mir - 2 , for the first time in history descended to the arctic sea ##bed beneath the north pole and placed there a russian flag made of rust - proof titanium alloy . [SEP]
[CLS] the flag - placing during ark ##ti ##ka 2007 generated commentary on and concern for a race for control of the arctic ' s vast hydro ##carbon resources . [SEP]
[CLS] foreign ministers and other officials representing canada , the kingdom of denmark , norway , russia , and the united states met in il ##uli ##ssa ##t , greenland on 28 may 2008 at the arctic ocean conference and announced the il ##uli ##ssa ##t declaration , blocking any " new comprehensive international legal regime to govern the arctic ocean , " and pl ##edging " the orderly settlement of any possible overlapping claims . " [SEP]
[CLS] as of 2012 , the kingdom of denmark is claiming the continental shelf based on the lo ##mon ##oso ##v ridge between greenland and over the north pole to the northern limit of the russian ee ##z . [SEP]
[CLS] the russian federation is also claiming a large swat ##h of sea ##bed along the lo ##mon ##oso ##v ridge but , unlike denmark , confined its claim to its side of the arctic . [SEP]
[CLS] in august 2015 , russia made a supplementary submission for the expansion of the external borders of its continental shelf in the arctic ocean , asserting that the eastern part of the lo ##mon ##oso ##v ridge and the men ##del ##eye ##v ridge are an extension of the eurasian continent . [SEP]
[CLS] in august 2016 , the un commission on the limits of the continental shelf began to consider russia ' s submission . [SEP]
[CLS] canada claims the northwest passage as part of its internal waters belonging to canada , while the united states and most maritime nations regards it as an international strait , which means that foreign vessels have right of transit passage . [SEP]
[CLS] since 1937 , the larger portion of the asian - side arctic region has been extensively explored by soviet and russian manned drifting ice stations . [SEP]
[CLS] between 1937 and 1991 , 88 international polar crews established and occupied scientific settlements on the drift ice and were carried thousands of kilometers by the ice flow . [SEP]
[CLS] the arctic is comparatively clean , although there are certain ecological ##ly difficult localized pollution problems that present a serious threat to people ' s health living around these pollution sources . [SEP]
[CLS] due to the prevailing worldwide sea and air currents , the arctic area is the fallout region for long - range transport poll ##uta ##nts , and in some places the concentrations exceed the levels of densely populated urban areas . [SEP]
[CLS] an example of this is the phenomenon of arctic haze , which is commonly blamed on long - range poll ##uta ##nts . [SEP]
[CLS] another example is with the bio ##ac ##cum ##ulation of pc ##b ' s ( poly ##ch ##lor ##inated bi ##ph ##en ##yl ##s ) in arctic wildlife and people . [SEP]
[CLS] there have been many proposals to preserve the arctic over the years . [SEP]
[CLS] most recently a group of stars at the rio earth summit , on 21 june 2012 , proposed protecting the arctic , similar to the antarctic protection . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial focus of the campaign will be a un resolution creating a global sanctuary around the pole , and a ban on oil drilling and un ##sus ##tain ##able fishing in the arctic . [SEP]
[CLS] the effects of global warming in the arctic include rising temperatures , loss of sea ice , and melting of the greenland ice sheet . [SEP]
[CLS] potential methane release from the region , especially through the tha ##wing of per ##ma ##fr ##ost and methane cl ##ath ##rates , is also a concern . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the amplified response of the arctic to global warming , it is often seen as a leading indicator of global warming . [SEP]
[CLS] the melting of greenland ' s ice sheet is linked to polar amp ##li ##fication . [SEP]
[CLS] the arctic is especially vulnerable to the effects of any climate change , as has become apparent with the reduction of sea ice in recent years . [SEP]
[CLS] climate models predict much greater warming in the arctic than the global average , resulting in significant international attention to the region . [SEP]
[CLS] in particular , there are concerns that arctic shrink ##age , a consequence of melting glaciers and other ice in greenland , could soon contribute to a substantial rise in sea levels worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] the current arctic warming is leading to fears of ancient carbon being released from tha ##wing per ##ma ##fr ##ost , leading to methane and carbon dioxide production by micro - organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] release of methane and carbon dioxide stored in per ##ma ##fr ##ost could cause abrupt and severe global warming , as they are potent greenhouse gases . [SEP]
[CLS] climate change is also predicted to have a large impact on tun ##dra vegetation , causing an increase of shrubs , and having a negative impact on br ##yo ##phy ##tes and li ##chen ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] apart from concerns regarding the detrimental effects of warming in the arctic , some potential opportunities have gained attention . [SEP]
[CLS] the melting of the ice is making the northwest passage , the shipping routes through the northernmost latitude ##s , more navigable , raising the possibility that the arctic region will become a prime trade route . [SEP]
[CLS] one ha ##rbin ##ger of the opening na ##vi ##ga ##bility of the arctic took place in the summer of 2016 when the crystal ser ##enity successfully navigate ##d the northwest passage , a first for a large cruise ship . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , it is believed that the arctic sea ##bed may contain substantial oil fields which may become accessible if the ice covering them melt ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] these factors have led to recent international debates as to which nations can claim sovereignty or ownership over the waters of the arctic . [SEP]
