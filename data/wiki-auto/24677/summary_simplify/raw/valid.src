By convention the Premier is the leader of the party with a parliamentary majority in the unicameral Legislative Assembly of Queensland.
Under section 42 of the Constitution of Queensland the Premier and other members of Cabinet are appointed by the Governor and are collectively responsible to Parliament.
In practice, under the conventions of the Westminster System followed in Queensland, the Premier's power is derived from two sources: command of a majority in the Legislative Assembly, and the Premier's role as chair of Cabinet, determining the appointment and roles of Ministers.
Although ministerial appointments are the prerogative of the Governor of Queensland, in normal circumstances the Governor will make these appointments under the "advice" (in reality, direction) of the Premier.
A re-elected government will be resworn, with adjustments to the ministry as determined by the Premier.
The Premier has an office in the Executive Annexe of Parliament House, Brisbane, which is normally used while Parliament is sitting.
At other times the Premier's ministerial office is in 1 William Street, which is across the road from the Executive Annexe.
Before the 1890s, there was no developed party system in Queensland.
Before the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, political parties were more akin to parliamentary factions, and were fluid, informal and disorganised by modern standards.
