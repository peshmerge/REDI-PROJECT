[CLS] the atari 520 ##0 super ##sy ##ste ##m , commonly known as the atari 520 ##0 , is a home video game console that was introduced in 1982 by atari inc . as a higher - end complementary console for the popular atari 260 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 520 ##0 was created to compete with the intel ##li ##vision , but wound up more directly competing with the cole ##co ##vision shortly after its release . [SEP]
[CLS] the 520 ##0 ' s internal hardware is almost identical to that of atari ' s 8 - bit computers , although software is not directly compatible between the two systems . [SEP]
[CLS] the 520 ##0 ' s controllers have an analog joy ##stick and a nu ##meric key ##pad along with start , pause , and reset buttons . [SEP]
[CLS] the 360 - degree non - center ##ing joy ##stick was to ##uted as offering more control than the eight - way joy ##stick controller offered with the atari 260 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] on may 21 , 1984 , during a press conference at which the atari 780 ##0 was introduced , company executives revealed that the 520 ##0 had been discontinued after just two years on the market . [SEP]
[CLS] total sales of the 520 ##0 were reportedly in excess of 1 million units . [SEP]
[CLS] much of the technology in the atari 8 - bit family of home computer systems was originally developed as a second - generation games console intended to replace the 260 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , as the system was reaching completion , the personal computer revolution was starting with the release of machines like the commodore pet , tr ##s - 80 and apple ii . [SEP]
[CLS] these machines had less advanced hardware than the new atari technology , but sold for much higher prices with associated higher profit margins . [SEP]
[CLS] atari ' s management decided to enter this market , and the technology was rep ##ack ##aged into the atari 400 and 800 . [SEP]
[CLS] the chips ##et used in these machines was created with the minds ##et that the 260 ##0 would likely be obsolete by the 1980 time frame . [SEP]
[CLS] atari later decided to re - enter the games market with a design that closely matched their original 1978 specifications . [SEP]
[CLS] in its prototype stage , the atari 520 ##0 was originally called the " atari video system x â€“ advanced video computer system " , and was code ##name ##d " pam " after a female employee at atari , inc . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also rumored that pam actually stood for " personal arcade machine " , as the majority of games for the system ended up being arcade conversions . [SEP]
[CLS] actual working " atari video system x " machines , whose hardware is 100 % identical to the atari 520 ##0 do exist , but are extremely rare . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial 1982 release of the system featured four controller ports , where nearly all other systems of the day had only one or two ports . [SEP]
[CLS] the 520 ##0 also featured a new style of controller with an analog joy ##stick , nu ##meric key ##pad , two fire buttons on each side of the controller and game function keys for start , pause , and reset . [SEP]
[CLS] the 520 ##0 also featured the innovation of the first automatic tv switch ##box , allowing it to automatically switch from regular tv viewing to the game system signal when the system was activated . [SEP]
[CLS] previous rf adapt ##ers required the user to slide a switch on the adapt ##er by hand . [SEP]
[CLS] the rf box was also where the power supply connected in a unique dual power / television signal setup similar to the rca studio ii ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] a single cable coming out of the 520 ##0 plug ##ged into the switch box and was used for both electricity and the television signal . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1983 revision of the atari 520 ##0 has two controller ports instead of four , and a change back to the more conventional separate power supply and standard non - auto ##sw ##itch ##ing rf switch . [SEP]
[CLS] it also has changes in the cartridge port address lines to allow for the atari 260 ##0 adapt ##er released that year . [SEP]
[CLS] while the adapt ##er was only made to work on the two - port version , modifications can be made to the four - port to make it line - compatible . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , towards the end of the four - port model ' s production run , there were a limited number of consoles produced which included these modifications . [SEP]
[CLS] these consoles can be identified by an as ##ter ##isk in their serial numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] the controller prototypes used in the electrical development lab employed a yo ##ke and gi ##mba ##l mechanism that came from an rc airplane controller kit . [SEP]
[CLS] the design of the analog joy ##stick , which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to provide center ##ing , proved to be un ##gai ##nl ##y and unreliable . [SEP]
[CLS] they quickly became the achilles ' heel of the system because of their combination of an overly complex mechanical design with a very low - cost internal flex circuit system . [SEP]
[CLS] another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not translate into a linear acceleration from the center through the arc of the stick travel . [SEP]
[CLS] the controllers did , however , include a pause button , a unique feature at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] various third - party replacement joy ##stick ##s were also released , including those made by wi ##co . [SEP]
[CLS] atari inc . released the pro - line tr ##ak - ball controller for the system , which was used primarily for gaming titles such as " cent ##ipe ##de " and " missile command " . [SEP]
[CLS] a paddle controller and an updated self - center ##ing version of the original controller were also in development , but never made it to market . [SEP]
[CLS] games were shipped with plastic card over ##lay ##s that snapped in over the key ##pad . [SEP]
[CLS] the card would indicate which game functions , such as changing the view or vehicle speed , were assigned to each key . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary controller was ranked the 10th worst video game controller by ign editor craig harris . [SEP]
[CLS] an editor for " next generation " said that their non - center ##ing joy ##stick ##s " rendered many games nearly un ##play ##able " . [SEP]
[CLS] david h . ahl in 1983 described the atari 520 ##0 as " a 400 computer in disguise " . [SEP]
[CLS] its internal design was extensively based on that of the atari 8 - bit family , including anti ##c , poke ##y , and gt ##ia . [SEP]
[CLS] software designed for one does not run on the other , but port ##ing the source code is not difficult as long as it does not use computer - specific features . [SEP]
[CLS] " anti ##c " magazine reported in 1984 that " the similarities gross ##ly out ##weig ##h the differences , so that a 520 ##0 program can be developed and almost entirely de ##bu ##gged on an atari 8 - bit computer before testing on a 520 ##0 " . [SEP]
[CLS] john j . anderson of " creative computing " all ##uded to the inc ##omp ##ati ##bility being intentional , caused by rival ##ries between atari ' s computer and console divisions . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1987 , atari corporation released the x ##e game system console , which was essentially a rep ##ack ##aged 65 ##x ##e ( the then - current iteration of the 8 - bit computer line ) with a det ##ach ##able keyboard that could run home computer titles directly , unlike the 520 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] anderson wrote in 1984 that atari could have released a console compatible with computer software in 1981 . [SEP]
[CLS] the atari 520 ##0 did not fare well commercially compared to its predecessor , the atari 260 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] while it to ##uted superior graphics to the 260 ##0 and matt ##el ' s intel ##li ##vision , the system was initially incompatible with the 260 ##0 ' s expansive library of games , and some market analysts have speculated that this hurt its sales , especially since an atari 260 ##0 cartridge adapt ##er had been released for the intel ##li ##vision ii . [SEP]
[CLS] ( a revised 2 - port model was released in 1983 , along with a game adapt ##er that allowed gamer ##s to play all 260 ##0 games . ) [SEP]
[CLS] this lack of new games was due in part to a lack of funding , with atari continuing to develop most of its games for the saturated 260 ##0 market . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the 520 ##0 ' s games appeared simply as updated versions of 260 ##0 titles , which failed to ex ##cite consumers . [SEP]
[CLS] its pack - in game , " super breakout " , was criticized for not doing enough to demonstrate the system ' s capabilities , and this gave the cole ##co ##vision a significant advantage when its pack - in , " donkey kong " , delivered a more authentic arcade experience than any previous game cartridge . [SEP]
[CLS] in its list of the top 25 game consoles of all time , ign claimed that the main reason for the 520 ##0 ' s market failure was the technological superiority of its competitor , while other sources maintain that the two consoles are roughly equivalent in power . [SEP]
[CLS] the 520 ##0 received much criticism for the " sloppy " design of its non - center ##ing analog controllers . [SEP]
[CLS] anderson described the controllers as " absolutely at ##ro ##cious " . [SEP]
[CLS] david h . ahl of " creative computing video & arcade games " said in 1983 that the " atari 520 ##0 is , dare i say it , atari ' s answer to intel ##li ##vision , cole ##co ##vision , and the astro ##cade " , describing the console as a " true mass market " version of the atari 8 - bit computers despite the software inc ##omp ##ati ##bility . [SEP]
[CLS] he criticized the joy ##stick ' s imp ##re ##cise control but said that " it is at least as good as many other controllers " , and wondered why " super breakout " was the pack - in game when it did not use the 520 ##0 ' s improved graphics . [SEP]
[CLS] at one point following the 520 ##0 ' s release , atari had planned a smaller , cost - reduced version of the atari 520 ##0 , which would have removed the controller storage bin . [SEP]
[CLS] code - named the " atari 510 ##0 " ( a . k . a . " atari 520 ##0 jr . " ) , only a few fully working prototype 510 ##0s were made before the project was canceled . [SEP]
