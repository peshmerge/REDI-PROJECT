[CLS] ore ##gano is related to the herb mar ##jo ##ram , sometimes being referred to as wild mar ##jo ##ram . [SEP]
[CLS] ore ##gano has purple flowers and spade - shaped , olive - green leaves . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a perennial , although it is grown as an annual in colder climates , as it often does not survive the winter . [SEP]
[CLS] ore ##gano is planted in early spring , the plants being spaced 12 in apart in fairly dry soil , with full sun . [SEP]
[CLS] ore ##gano will grow in a ph range between 6 . 0 ( mildly acidic ) and 9 . 0 ( strongly al ##kali ##ne ) , with a preferred range between 6 . 0 and 8 . 0 . [SEP]
[CLS] it prefers a hot , relatively dry climate , but does well in other environments . [SEP]
[CLS] many subspecies and strains of ore ##gano have been developed by humans over centuries for their unique flavour ##s or other characteristics . [SEP]
[CLS] tastes range from spicy or as ##tri ##ngen ##t to more complicated and sweet . [SEP]
[CLS] simple ore ##gano sold in garden stores as " or ##igan ##um vulgar ##e " may have a bland taste and larger , less - dense leaves , and is not considered the best for culinary use , with a taste less remarkable and pun ##gent . [SEP]
[CLS] it can poll ##inate other more sophisticated strains , but the offspring are rarely better in quality . [SEP]
[CLS] the related species , " or ##igan ##um on ##ites " ( greece , turkey ) and " o . syriac ##um " ( west asia ) , have similar flavour ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] a closely related plant is mar ##jo ##ram from turkey , which differs significantly in taste though , because ph ##eno ##lic compounds are missing from its essential oil . [SEP]

[CLS] factors such as climate , season , and soil composition may affect the aromatic oils present , and this effect may be greater than the differences between the various species of plants . [SEP]
[CLS] among the chemical compounds contributing to the flavour are car ##vac ##rol , thy ##mo ##l , limo ##nen ##e , pine ##ne , o ##ci ##men ##e , and cary ##op ##hyl ##lene . [SEP]
[CLS] ore ##gano ' s most prominent modern use is as the staple herb of italian cuisine . [SEP]

[CLS] although ore ##gano or its oil may be used as a dietary supplement , there is no clinical evidence to indicate that either has any effect on human health . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2014 , the us food and drug administration ( fda ) warned a utah company , young living , that its herbal products , including ore ##gano essential oil , were being promoted to have numerous un ##pro ##ven anti - disease effects , and so were being sold as unauthorized mis ##brand ##ed drugs subject to seizure and federal penalties .

[CLS] the essential oil of ore ##gano is composed primarily of mono ##ter ##pen ##oids and mono ##ter ##pen ##es , with the relative concentration of each compound varying widely across geographic origin and other factors . [SEP]
[CLS] over 60 different compounds have been identified , with the primary ones being car ##vac ##rol and thy ##mo ##l ranging to over 80 % , while lesser abundant compounds include p - cy ##men ##e , γ - ter ##pine ##ne , cary ##op ##hyl ##lene , spat ##hul ##eno ##l , ge ##rma ##cre ##ne - d , β - fen ##chy ##l alcohol and δ - ter ##pine ##ol . [SEP]
[CLS] drying of the plant material affects both quantity and distribution of volatile compounds , with methods using higher heat and longer drying times having greater negative impact . [SEP]
[CLS] a sample of fresh whole plant material found to contain 33 g / kg dry weight ( 3 . 1 g / kg wet ) decreased to below a third after warm - air convection drying . [SEP]
[CLS] much higher concentrations of volatile compounds are achieved towards the end of the growing season . [SEP]
