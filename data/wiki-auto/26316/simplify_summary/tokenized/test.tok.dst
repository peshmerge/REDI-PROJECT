[CLS] racial segregation is the systemic separation of people into racial or other ethnic groups in daily life . [SEP]
[CLS] it may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant , drinking from a water fountain , using a public toilet , attending school , going to the movies , riding on a bus , or in the rental or purchase of a home or of hotel rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] segregation is defined by the european commission against racism and into ##ler ##ance as " the act by which a ( natural or legal ) person separates other persons on the basis of one of the en ##ume ##rated grounds without an objective and reasonable justification , in conform ##ity with the proposed definition of discrimination . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , the voluntary act of separating oneself from other people on the basis of one of the en ##ume ##rated grounds does not constitute segregation " . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the un forum on minority issues , " the creation and development of classes and schools providing education in minority languages should not be considered imp ##er ##missible segregation , if the assignment to such classes and schools is of a voluntary nature " . [SEP]
[CLS] racial segregation is generally outlawed , but may exist " de facto " through social norms , even when there is no strong individual preference for it , as suggested by thomas sc ##hell ##ing ' s models of segregation and subsequent work . [SEP]
[CLS] segregation may be maintained by means ranging from discrimination in hiring and in the rental and sale of housing to certain races to vi ##gil ##ante violence ( such as lynch ##ings ) . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , a situation that arises when members of different races mutually prefer to associate and do business with members of their own race would usually be described as " separation " or " de facto separation " of the races rather than " segregation " . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , segregation was mandated by law in some states and came with anti - mis ##ce ##gen ##ation laws ( prohibition ##s against inter ##rac ##ial marriage ) . [SEP]
[CLS] segregation , however , often allowed close contact in hierarchical situations , such as allowing a person of one race to work as a servant for a member of another race . [SEP]
[CLS] segregation can involve spatial separation of the races , and mandatory use of different institutions , such as schools and hospitals by people of different races . [SEP]
[CLS] wherever there have been multi ##rac ##ial communities , there has been racial segregation . [SEP]
[CLS] only areas with extensive mis ##ce ##gen ##ation , or mixing , such as hawaii and brazil , despite some social st ##rat ##ification , seem to be exempt . [SEP]
[CLS] following its conquest of ottoman controlled algeria in 1830 , for well over a century france maintained colonial rule in the territory which has been described as " quasi - apartheid " . [SEP]
[CLS] the colonial law of 1865 allowed arab and berber algerian ##s to apply for french citizenship only if they abandoned their muslim identity ; az ##zed ##ine had ##dou ##r argues that this established " the formal structures of a political apartheid " . [SEP]
[CLS] camille bono ##ra - wai ##sman writes that , " in contrast with the moroccan and tunisian protectorate ##s " , this " colonial apartheid society " was unique to algeria . [SEP]
[CLS] this " internal system of apartheid " met with considerable resistance from the muslims affected by it , and is cited as one of the causes of the 1954 insurrection and ensuing independence war . [SEP]
[CLS] in fifteenth - century north - east germany , people of wen ##dis ##h , i . e . slavic , origin were not allowed to join some guild ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] according to wilhelm ra ##abe , " down into the eighteenth century no german guild accepted a wen ##d . " [SEP]
[CLS] german praise for america ' s institutional racism , previously found in hitler ' s " mein kam ##pf " , was continuous throughout the early 1930s , and radical nazi lawyers were advocates of the use of american models . [SEP]
[CLS] race based u . s . citizenship laws and anti - mis ##ce ##gen ##ation laws directly inspired the two principal nuremberg laws — the citizenship law and the blood law . [SEP]
[CLS] the ban on inter ##rac ##ial marriage ( anti - mis ##ce ##gen ##ation ) prohibited sexual relations and marriages between people classified as " aryan " and " non - aryan " . [SEP]
[CLS] such relationships were called " ras ##sen ##sch ##and ##e " ( race def ##ile ##ment ) . [SEP]
[CLS] at first the laws were aimed primarily at jews but were later extended to " g ##yp ##sies , negro ##es and their bastard offspring " . [SEP]
[CLS] aryan ##s found guilty could face inca ##rce ##ration in a nazi concentration camp , while non - aryan ##s could face the death penalty . [SEP]
[CLS] to preserve the so - called purity of the german blood , after the war began , the nazis extended the race def ##ile ##ment law to include all foreigners ( non - germans ) . [SEP]
[CLS] under the general government of occupied poland in 1940 , the nazis divided the population into different groups , each with different rights , food rations , allowed housing strips in the cities , public transportation , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] in an effort to split polish identity they attempted to establish ethnic divisions of ka ##shu ##bians and gora ##ls ( gora ##len ##vo ##lk ) , based on these groups ' alleged " germanic component " . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1930s and 1940s , jews in nazi - controlled states were made to wear something that identified them as jewish , such as a yellow ribbon or star of david , and were , along with roma ##s ( g ##yp ##sies ) , disc ##rim ##inated against by the racial laws . [SEP]
[CLS] jewish doctors were not allowed to treat aryan patients nor were jewish professors permitted to teach aryan pupils . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , jews were not allowed to use any public transportation , besides the ferry , and were able to shop only from 3 – 5 pm in jewish stores . [SEP]
[CLS] after " kris ##tal ##ln ##ach ##t " ( " the night of broken glass " ) , the jews were fined 1 , 000 , 000 marks for damages done by the nazi troops and ss members . [SEP]
[CLS] jews and roma were subjected to genocide as " und ##es ##ira ##ble " racial groups in the holocaust . [SEP]
[CLS] the nazis established ghetto ##s to con ##fine jews and sometimes roma ##s into tightly packed areas of the cities of eastern europe , turning them into " de facto " concentration camps . [SEP]
[CLS] the warsaw ghetto was the largest of these ghetto ##s , with 400 , 000 people . [SEP]
[CLS] the łodz ghetto was the second largest , holding about 160 , 000 . [SEP]
[CLS] between 1939 and 1945 , at least 1 . 5 million polish citizens were transported to the reich for forced labour ( in all , about 12 million forced laborers were employed in the german war economy inside nazi germany ) . [SEP]
[CLS] although nazi germany also used forced laborers from western europe , poles , along with other eastern europeans viewed as racial ##ly inferior , were subject to deeper disc ##rim ##inatory measures . [SEP]
[CLS] they were forced to wear a yellow with purple border and letter " p " ( for pole ##n / polish ) cloth identifying tag se ##wn to their clothing , subjected to a cu ##rf ##ew , and banned from public transportation . [SEP]
[CLS] while the treatment of factory workers or farm hands often varied depending on the individual employer , polish laborers as a rule were compelled to work longer hours for lower wages than western europeans – in many cities , they were forced to live in segregated barracks behind barbed wire . [SEP]
[CLS] social relations with germans outside work were forbidden , and sexual relations ( " ras ##sen ##sch ##and ##e " or " racial def ##ile ##ment " ) were punish ##able by death . [SEP]
[CLS] several laws enforcing racial segregation of foreigners from chinese were passed by the han chinese during the tang dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] in 77 ##9 the tang dynasty issued an edict which forced ui ##gh ##urs to wear their ethnic dress , stopped them from marrying chinese females , and banned them from pretending to be chinese . [SEP]
[CLS] chinese disliked ui ##gh ##urs because they practiced us ##ury . [SEP]
[CLS] the magistrate who issued the orders may have wanted to protect " purity " in chinese custom . [SEP]
[CLS] in 83 ##6 , when lu chun was appointed as governor of canton , he was disgusted to find chinese living with foreigners and inter ##mar ##ria ##ge between chinese and foreigners . [SEP]
[CLS] lu enforced separation , banning inter ##rac ##ial marriages , and made it illegal for foreigners to own property . [SEP]
[CLS] lu chun believed his principles were just and upright . [SEP]
[CLS] the 83 ##6 law specifically banned chinese from forming relationships with " dark peoples " or " people of colour " , which was used to describe foreigners , such as " iranian ##s , so ##g ##dian ##s , arabs , indians , malay ##s , sumatra ##ns " , among others . [SEP]
[CLS] the qing dynasty was founded not by the han chinese who form the majority of the chinese population , but the manchu ##s , who are today an ethnic minority of china . [SEP]
[CLS] the manchu ##s were keen ##ly aware of their minority status , however , it was only later in the dynasty that they banned inter ##mar ##ria ##ge . [SEP]
[CLS] han defect ##ors played a massive role in the qing conquest of china . [SEP]
[CLS] han chinese generals who defected to the manchu were often given women from the imperial ai ##sin gi ##oro family in marriage while the ordinary soldiers who defected were given non - royal manchu women as wives . [SEP]
[CLS] the manchu leader nur ##ha ##ci married one of his granddaughter ##s to the ming general li yong ##fan ##g after he surrendered fu ##shu ##n in lia ##oning to the manchu in 1618 . [SEP]
[CLS] ju ##rch ##en ( manchu ) women married most the han chinese defect ##ors in lia ##odon ##g . [SEP]
[CLS] ai ##sin gi ##oro women were married to the sons of the han chinese generals sun si ##ke ( sun ss ##u - k ' o ) , gen ##g jim ##ao ( ken ##g chi - mao ) , shang ke ##xi ( shang k ' o - hs ##i ) , and wu sang ##ui ( wu san - ku ##ei ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a mass marriage of han chinese officers and officials to manchu women numbering 1 , 000 couples was arranged by prince yo ##to and hong ##tai ##ji in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups . [SEP]
[CLS] gen ##g z ##hong ##ming , a han banner ##man , was awarded the title of prince jing ##nan , and his son gen ##g jing ##ma ##o managed to have both his sons gen ##g jing ##zh ##ong and gen ##g zhao ##zh ##ong become court attendants under shu ##nz ##hi and get married to ai ##sin gi ##oro women , with ha ##oge ' s ( a son of hong tai ##ji ) daughter marrying gen ##g jing ##zh ##ong and prince aba ##tai ' s ( hong tai ##ji ) granddaughter marrying gen ##g zhao ##zh ##ong . [SEP]
[CLS] the qing differentiated between han banner ##men and ordinary han civilians . [SEP]
[CLS] han banner ##men were made out of han chinese who defected to the qing up to 1644 and joined the eight banners , giving them social and legal privileges in addition to being acc ##ult ##ura ##ted to manchu culture . [SEP]
[CLS] so many han defected to the qing and swelled up the ranks of the eight banners that ethnic manchu ##s became a minority within the banners , making up only 16 % in 1648 , with han banner ##men dominating at 75 % . [SEP]
[CLS] it was this multi - ethnic force in which manchu ##s were only a minority , which conquered china for the qing . [SEP]
[CLS] it was han chinese banner ##men who were responsible for the successful qing conquest of china , they made up the majority of governors in the early qing and were the ones who governed and administered china after the conquest , stab ##ili ##zing qing rule . [SEP]
[CLS] han banner ##men dominated the post of governor - general in the time of the shu ##nz ##hi and kang ##xi emperors , and also the post of governors , largely excluding ordinary han civilians from the posts . [SEP]
[CLS] to promote ethnic harmony , a 1648 decree from the manchu shu ##nz ##hi emperor allowed han chinese civilian men to marry manchu women from the banners with the permission of the board of revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or common ##ers or the permission of their banner company captain if they were un ##re ##gist ##ered common ##ers , it was only later in the dynasty that these policies allowing inter ##mar ##ria ##ge were done away with . [SEP]
[CLS] the qing implemented a policy of segregation between the banner ##men of the eight banners ( manchu banner ##men , mongol banner ##men , han banner ##men ) and han chinese civilians . [SEP]
[CLS] this ethnic segregation had cultural and economic reasons : inter ##mar ##ria ##ge was forbidden to keep up the manchu heritage and minimize sin ##ici ##zation . [SEP]
[CLS] han chinese civilians and mongol civilians were banned from settling in manchu ##ria . [SEP]
[CLS] han civilians and mongol civilians were banned from crossing into each other ' s lands . [SEP]
[CLS] ordinary mongol civilians in inner mongolia were banned from even crossing into other mongol banners . [SEP]
[CLS] ( a banner in inner mongolia was an administrative division and not related to the mongol banner ##men in the eight banners ) [SEP]
[CLS] these restrictions did not apply han banner ##men , who were settled in manchu ##ria by the qing . [SEP]
[CLS] han banner ##men were differentiated from han civilians by the qing and treated differently . [SEP]
[CLS] the qing dynasty started colon ##izing manchu ##ria with han chinese later on in the dynasty ' s rule , but the manchu area was still separated from modern - day inner mongolia by the outer willow pali ##sa ##de , which kept the manchu and the mongols in the area separate . [SEP]
[CLS] the policy of segregation applied directly to the banner garrison ##s , most of which occupied a separate walled zone within the cities in which they were stationed . [SEP]
[CLS] manchu banner ##men , han banner ##men , and mongol banner ##men were separated from the han civilian population . [SEP]
[CLS] while the manchu ##s followed the governmental structure of the preceding ming dynasty , their ethnic policy dictated that appointments were split between manchu noble ##men and han chinese civilian officials who had passed the highest levels of the state examinations , and because of the small number of manchu ##s , this ins ##ured that a large fraction of them would be government officials . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1938 , the fascist regime led by benito mussolini , under pressure from the nazis , introduced a series of italian racial laws institut ##ing an official segregation ##ist policy in the italian empire , especially aimed against jews . [SEP]
[CLS] this policy enforced various segregation ##ist norms , like the prohibition for jews to teach or study in ordinary schools and universities , to own industries reputed of major national interest , to work as journalists , to enter the military , and to wed non - jews . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the immediate consequences of the introduction of the ' pro ##v ##ved ##ime ##nti per la di ##fe ##sa della ra ##zza ' ( norms for the defence of the race ) included many of the best italian scientists leaving their job , or even italy . [SEP]
[CLS] amongst these , world - renowned physicist ##s emilio se ##gre , enrico fe ##rmi ( whose wife was jewish ) , bruno pont ##ec ##or ##vo , bruno rossi , tu ##lli ##o levi - ci ##vita , mathematicians fed ##eri ##go enrique ##s and guido fu ##bin ##i and even the fascist propaganda director , art critic and journalist mar ##gh ##eri ##ta sar ##fat ##ti , who was one of mussolini ' s mistress ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] rita levi - mont ##al ##cini , who would successively win the nobel prize for medicine , was forbidden to work at the university . [SEP]

[CLS] by the early 20th century , the majority of european jews lived in the pale of settlement . [SEP]
[CLS] jewish population were confined to mel ##lah ##s in morocco beginning from the 15th century . [SEP]
[CLS] in cities , a " mel ##lah " was surrounded by a wall with a fortified gateway . [SEP]

[CLS] spanish colonists created caste systems in latin american countries based on classification by race and race mixture . [SEP]
[CLS] an extensive nomenclature developed , including the familiar terms " mu ##lat ##to " , " me ##sti ##zo " , and " za ##mbo " ( the latter the origin of " sam ##bo " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the spanish had practiced a form of caste system in his ##pani ##a before their expulsion of the jews and muslims . [SEP]
[CLS] while many latin american countries have long since rendered the system officially illegal through legislation , usually at the time of independence , prejudice based on degrees of perceived racial distance from european ancestry combined with one ' s socio ##economic status remain , an echo of the colonial caste system . [SEP]
[CLS] on 16 may 1940 , " ad ##mini ##stra ##s ##jon ##sr ##ade ##t " asked ri ##ks ##ko ##mm ##isa ##ria ##tet why radio receivers had been confiscated from jews in norway . [SEP]
[CLS] " ad ##mini ##stra ##s ##jon ##sr ##ade ##t " thereafter " quietly " accepted racial segregation between norwegian citizens , has been claimed by tor bo ##mann - larsen . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , he claimed that this segregation " created a precedent . [SEP]

[CLS] laws enforcing segregation had been around before 1965 , although many institutions simply ignored them . [SEP]
[CLS] one highly publicized legal battle occurred in 1960 involving the opening of a new theatre that was to be open to all races ; the proposed un ##se ##gre ##gated public toilets at the newly built rep ##s theatre in 1959 caused an argument called " the battle of the toilets " . [SEP]
[CLS] the apartheid system carried out by af ##rika ##ner minority rule enacted a nationwide social policy " separate development " with the national party victory in 1948 , following the " colour bar " - disc ##rim ##inatory legislation dating back to the beginning of the union of south africa and the boer republics before which , while rep ##ress ##ive to black south africans along with other minorities , had not gone nearly so far . [SEP]
[CLS] apartheid laws can be generally divided into following acts . [SEP]
[CLS] firstly , the population registration act in 1950 classified residents in south africa into four racial groups : " black " , " white " , " coloured " , and " indian " and noted their racial identities on their identification ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] secondly , the group areas act in 1950 assigned different regions according to different races . [SEP]

[CLS] the period that followed is known as the nad ##ir of american race relations . [SEP]
[CLS] the legislation ( or in some states , such as florida , the state constitution ##s ) that mandated segregation lasted at least until a 1968 ruling by the supreme court outlaw ##ing all forms of segregation . [SEP]
[CLS] while the u . s . supreme court majority in the 1896 " pl ##ess ##y v . ferguson " case explicitly permitted " separate but equal " facilities ( specifically , transportation facilities ) , justice john marshall harlan , in his dissent , protested that the decision was an expression of white supremacy ; he predicted that segregation would " stimulate aggression ##s . . . upon the admitted rights of colored citizens " , " ar ##ouse race hate " , and " per ##pet ##uate a feeling of distrust between the races .

[CLS] since the 1970s , there has been a concern expressed by some academics that major canadian cities are becoming more segregated on income and ethnic lines . [SEP]
[CLS] reports have indicated that the inner suburbs of post - merger toronto and the southern bedroom communities of greater vancouver have become steadily more immigrant and visible minority dominated communities and have la ##gged behind other neighbourhoods in average income . [SEP]
[CLS] a cbc panel in vancouver in 2012 discussed the growing public fear that the proliferation of ethnic enclave ##s in greater vancouver ( such as han chinese in richmond and punjabi ##s in surrey ) amounted to a type of self - segregation . [SEP]

[CLS] canadians of other nations who fish in the separate fisheries have been arrested , jailed and prosecuted . [SEP]
[CLS] although the fishermen who were prosecuted were successful at trial ( see the decision in r . v . ka ##pp ) , the decision was overturned on appeal . [SEP]
[CLS] on final appeal , the supreme court of canada ruled in favour of the program on the grounds that segregation of this workplace is a step towards equality in canada . [SEP]
[CLS] affirmative action programs in canada are protected from equality rights challenges by s . 15 ( 2 ) of the canadian charter of rights and freedoms . [SEP]
[CLS] segregation continues today , but more than 35 % of the fishermen in the bc commercial fishery are of aboriginal ancestry , yet canadians of aboriginal ancestry comprise less than 4 % of bc ' s population . [SEP]
[CLS] two military coup ##s in fiji in 1987 removed a democratic ##ally elected government led by an indo - fiji ##ans . [SEP]
[CLS] the coup was supported principally by the ethnic fiji ##an population . [SEP]
[CLS] a new constitution was prom ##ul ##gated in 1990 , establishing fiji as a republic , with the offices of president , prime minister , two - thirds of the senate , and a clear majority of the house of representatives reserved for ethnic fiji ##ans ; ethnic fiji ##an ownership of the land was also en ##tre ##nched in the constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] most of these provisions were ended with the prom ##ul ##gation of the 1997 constitution , although the president , and 14 of the 32 senators were still selected by the all - indigenous great council of chiefs . [SEP]
[CLS] the last of these distinctions were removed by the 2013 constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] fiji ' s case is a situation of de facto ethnic segregation . [SEP]
[CLS] fiji has a long complex history with more than 350 ##0 years as a divided tribal nation . [SEP]
[CLS] unification under the british rule as a colony for 96 years brought other racial groups , particularly immigrants from the indian subcontinent . [SEP]
[CLS] israeli declaration of independence pro ##claim ##s equal rights to all citizens regardless of ethnicity , denomination or race . [SEP]
[CLS] israel has a substantial list of laws that demand racial equality ( such as prohibition of discrimination , equality in employment , libel based on race or ethnicity . ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there is however , in practice , significant institutional , legal , and societal discrimination against the country ' s arab citizens . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2010 , the israeli supreme court sent a message against racial segregation in a case involving the sl ##oni ##m has ##si ##dic sect of the ash ##ken ##azi jews , ruling that segregation between ash ##ken ##azi and sep ##hard ##i students in a school is illegal . [SEP]
[CLS] they argue that they seek " to maintain an equal level of re ##li ##gio ##sity , not from racism " . [SEP]
[CLS] responding to the charges , the sl ##oni ##m hare ##dim invited sep ##hard ##i girls to school , and added in a statement : " all along , we said it ' s not about race , but the high court went out against our rabbis , and therefore we went to prison . " [SEP]
[CLS] due to many cultural differences , and an ##imo ##sity towards a minority perceived to wish to ann ##ih ##ila ##te israel , a system of passive ##ly co - existing communities , segregated along ethnic lines has emerged in israel , with arab - israeli minority communities being left " maroon ##ed outside the mainstream " . [SEP]
[CLS] this de facto segregation also exists between different jewish ethnic groups ( " " edo ##t " " ) such as sep ##hara ##dim , ash ##ken ##azi ##m and beta israel ( jews of ethiopian descent ) , which leads to de facto segregated schools , housing and public policy . [SEP]
[CLS] the government has embarked on a program to shut down such schools , in order to force integration , but some in the ethiopian community complained that not all such schools have been closed . [SEP]
[CLS] in a 2007 poll commissioned by the center against racism and conducted by the geo ##car ##to ##graph ##ia institute , 75 % of israeli jews would not agree to live in a building with arab residents , 60 % would not accept any arab visitors at their homes , 40 % believed that arabs should be stripped of their right to vote , and 59 % believe that the culture of arabs is primitive . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2012 , a public opinion poll showed that 53 % of the polled israeli jews said they would not object to an arab living in their building , while 42 % said they would . [SEP]
[CLS] asked whether they would object to arab children being in their child ' s class in school , 49 % said they would not , 42 % said they would . [SEP]
[CLS] the secular israeli public was found to be the most tolerant , while the religious and hare ##di respondents were the most disc ##rim ##inatory . [SEP]
[CLS] the end of british colonial rule in kenya in 1964 led to an ina ##d ##vert ##ent increase in ethnic segregation . [SEP]
[CLS] through private purchases and government schemes , farm land previously held by european farmers was transferred to african owners . [SEP]
[CLS] these farms were further sub - divided into smaller localities , and , due to joint migration , many adjacent localities were occupied by members of different ethnic groups . [SEP]
[CLS] this separation along these boundaries persist ##s today . [SEP]
[CLS] kim ##uli ka ##sar ##a , in a study of recent ethnic violence in the wake of the disputed 2007 / 2008 kenyan elections , used these post - colonial boundaries as an instrument for the degree of ethnic segregation . [SEP]
[CLS] through a 2 stage least squares regression analysis , ka ##sar ##a showed that increased ethnic segregation in kenya ' s rift valley province is associated with an increase in ethnic violence . [SEP]
[CLS] liberia ##n constitution limits liberia ##n nationality to negro people ( see also liberia ##n nationality law ) . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , lebanese and indian nationals are active in trading , as well as in the retail and service sectors . [SEP]
[CLS] europeans and americans work in the mining and agricultural sectors . [SEP]
[CLS] these minority groups have long tenure ##d residence in the republic , but many are pre ##cl ##uded from becoming citizens as a result of their race . [SEP]
[CLS] malaysia has an article in its constitution which distinguishes the ethnic malay ##s and indigenous peoples of malaysia — i . e . bum ##ip ##ut ##ra — from the non - bum ##ip ##ut ##ra such as ethnic chinese and indians under the social contract , of which by law would guarantee the former certain special rights and privileges . [SEP]
[CLS] to question these rights and privileges however is strictly prohibited under the internal security act , legal ##ised by the 10th article ( iv ) of the constitution of malaysia . [SEP]
[CLS] the privileges mentioned here ##in covers — few of which — the economical and education aspects of malaysian ##s , e . g . the malaysian new economic policy ; an economic policy recently criticised by thierry rom ##mel — who headed a european commission ' s delegation to malaysia — as an excuse for " significant protection ##ism " and a quota maintaining higher access of malay ##s into public universities . [SEP]
[CLS] while legal racial segregation in daily life is not practiced , self - segregation does exist . [SEP]
[CLS] slavery in ma ##uri ##tania was finally criminal ##ized in august 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was already abolished in 1980 , although it was still affecting the black africans . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of slaves in the country was not known exactly , but it was estimated to be up to 600 , 000 men , women and children , or 20 % of the population . [SEP]
[CLS] for centuries , the so - called hara ##tin lower class , mostly poor black africans living in rural areas , have been considered natural slaves by white moors of arab / berber ancestry . [SEP]
[CLS] many descendants of the arab and berber tribes today still adhere to the su ##pre ##mac ##ist ideology of their ancestors . [SEP]
[CLS] this ideology has led to oppression , discrimination and even en ##sl ##ave ##ment of other groups in the region of sudan and western sahara . [SEP]
[CLS] the united kingdom has no legally sanctioned system of racial segregation and has a substantial list of laws that demand racial equality . [SEP]
[CLS] however , due to many cultural differences between the pre - existing system of passive ##ly co - existing communities , segregation along racial lines has emerged in parts of the united kingdom , with minority communities being left " maroon ##ed outside the mainstream " . [SEP]
[CLS] the affected and ' ghetto ##ised ' communities are often largely representative of pakistani ##s , indians and other sub - continental ##s , and has been thought to be the basis of ethnic tensions , and a deterioration of the standard of living and levels of education and employment among ethnic minorities in poorer areas . [SEP]
[CLS] these factors are considered by some to have been a cause of the 2001 race riots in bradford , oldham and burnley in the north of england which have large asian communities . [SEP]
[CLS] there may be some indication that such segregation , particularly in residential terms , seems to be the result of the un ##ila ##tera ##l ' steering ' of ethnic groups into particular areas as well as a culture of vendor discrimination and distrust of ethnic minority clients by some estate agents and other property professionals . [SEP]
[CLS] this may be indicative of a market preference amongst the more wealthy to reside in areas of less ethnic mixture ; less ethnic mixture being perceived as increasing the value and des ##ira ##bility of a residential area . [SEP]
[CLS] this is likely as other theories such as " ethnic self segregation " have sometimes been shown to be basel ##ess , and a majority of ethnic respondents to a few surveys on the matter have been in favour of wider social and residential integration . [SEP]
[CLS] de facto segregation in the united states has increased since the civil rights movement . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court ruled in mill ##ike ##n v . bradley ( 1974 ) that de facto racial segregation was acceptable , as long as schools were not actively making policies for racial exclusion ; since then , schools have been segregated due to myriad indirect factors . [SEP]
[CLS] red ##lining is part of how white communities maintained racist segregation . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the practice of denying or increasing the cost of services , such as mortgage ##s , banking , insurance , access to jobs , access to health care , or even supermarkets to residents in certain , often racial ##ly determined , areas . [SEP]
[CLS] the most devastating form of red ##lining , and the most common use of the term , refers to mortgage discrimination . [SEP]
[CLS] over the next twenty years , a succession of further court decisions and federal laws , including the " home mortgage disclosure act " and measure to end mortgage discrimination in 1975 , would completely invalid ##ate " de ju ##re " racial segregation and discrimination in the u . s . , although " de facto " segregation and discrimination have proven more res ##ili ##ent . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the civil rights project at harvard university , the actual de facto des ##eg ##re ##gation of u . s . public schools peaked in the late 1980s ; since that time , the schools have , in fact , become more segregated mainly due to the ethnic segregation of the nation with whites dominating the suburbs and minorities the urban centers . [SEP]
[CLS] according to raj ##iv seth ##i , an economist at columbia university , black - white segregation in housing is slowly declining for most metropolitan areas in the us . [SEP]
[CLS] racial segregation or separation can lead to social , economic and political tensions . [SEP]
[CLS] thirty years ( the year 2000 ) after the civil rights era , the united states remained in many areas a residential ##ly segregated society , in which blacks , whites and hispanic ##s inhabit different neighborhoods of vastly different quality . [SEP]
[CLS] dan im ##mer ##gl ##uck writes that in 2002 small businesses in black neighborhoods still received fewer loans , even after accounting for businesses density , businesses size , industrial mix , neighborhood income , and the credit quality of local businesses . [SEP]
[CLS] gregory d . squire ##s wrote in 2003 that it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry . [SEP]
[CLS] workers living in american inner cities have a harder time finding jobs than suburban workers . [SEP]
[CLS] the desire of many whites to avoid having their children attend integrated schools has been a factor in white flight to the suburbs . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2007 study in san francisco showed that groups of home ##own ##ers of all races tended to self - se ##gre ##gate in order to be with people of the same education level and race . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1990 , the legal barriers enforcing segregation had been mostly replaced by decent ##ral ##ized racism , where white people pay more than black people to live in predominantly white areas . [SEP]
[CLS] today , many whites are willing to pay a premium to live in a predominantly white neighborhood . [SEP]
[CLS] equivalent housing in white areas commands a higher rent . [SEP]
[CLS] these higher rents are largely at ##tri ##bu ##table to exclusion ##ary zoning policies that restrict the supply of housing . [SEP]
[CLS] regulations ensure that all housing units are expensive enough to prevent access by und ##es ##ira ##ble groups . [SEP]
[CLS] by bidding up the price of housing , many white neighborhoods effectively shut out black people , because they may be unwilling , or unable , to pay the premium to buy entry into these expensive neighborhoods . [SEP]
[CLS] conversely , equivalent housing in black neighborhoods is far more affordable to those who are unable or unwilling to pay a premium to live in white neighborhoods . [SEP]
[CLS] through the 1990s , residential segregation remained at its extreme and has been called " hyper ##se ##gre ##gation " by some sociologist ##s or " american apartheid " . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 2005 , the u . s . supreme court ruled in " johnson v . california " 54 ##3 u . s . 49 ##9 ( 2005 ) that the california department of corrections ' un ##written practice of racial ##ly se ##gre ##gating prisoners in its prison reception centers — which california claimed was for inmate safety ( gangs in california , as throughout the u . s . , usually organize on racial lines ) — is to be subject to strict scrutiny , the highest level of constitutional review . [SEP]
[CLS] in yemen , the arab elite practices a form of discrimination against the lower class al - ak ##hd ##am people based on their racial system . [SEP]
