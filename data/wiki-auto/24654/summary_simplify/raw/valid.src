The Premier of New South Wales is the head of government in the state of New South Wales, Australia.
The Premier is appointed by the Governor of New South Wales, and by modern convention holds office by virtue of his or her ability to command the support of a majority of members of the lower house of Parliament, the Legislative Assembly.
Prior to Federation in 1901 the term "Prime Minister of New South Wales" was also used.
"Premier" has been used more or less exclusively from 1901, to avoid confusion with the federal Prime Minister of Australia.
The current Premier is Gladys Berejiklian, the Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party, who assumed office on 23 January 2017.
