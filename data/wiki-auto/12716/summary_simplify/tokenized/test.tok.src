[CLS] pre ##script ##ive attempts to distinguish the g ##lis ##san ##do from the port ##ament ##o by limiting the former to the filling in of discrete intermediate pitches on instruments like the piano , harp , and fr ##ette ##d string ##ed instruments have run up against established usage of instruments like the trombone and tim ##pani . [SEP]
[CLS] the latter could thus be thought of as capable of either " g ##lis ##san ##do " or " port ##ament ##o " , depending on whether the drum was rolled or not . [SEP]
[CLS] the clarinet gesture that opens " rhapsody in blue " could likewise be thought of either way : it was originally planned as a g ##lis ##san ##do ( gershwin ' s score labels each individual note ) but is in practice played as a port ##ament ##o though described as a g ##lis ##san ##do . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , on a keyboard , a player ' s fingertips can be made to slide across the white keys or over the black keys , producing either a c major scale or an f ##♯ major pen ##tat ##onic ( or their relative modes ) ; or , by performing both at once , it is possible to produce a full ch ##romatic scale , but this is difficult . [SEP]
[CLS] organ players — particularly in contemporary music — sometimes employ an effect known as the palm g ##lis ##san ##do , where over the course of the g ##lis ##san ##do the flat of the hand is used to de ##press a wide area of keys simultaneously , resulting in a dramatic at ##onal sweep . [SEP]
[CLS] maurice rave ##l ' s piece al ##bor ##ada del gr ##acio ##so contains notable piano g ##lis ##san ##do passages in thirds executed by the right hand . [SEP]
[CLS] musical instruments with can effect a port ##ament ##o over a substantial range . [SEP]
[CLS] these include un ##fr ##ette ##d string ##ed instruments ( such as the violin , viola , cello and double bass , and fr ##et ##less guitars ) , string ##ed instruments with a way of stretching the strings ( such as the guitar , ve ##ena , or sit ##ar ) , a fr ##ette ##d guitar or lap steel guitar when accompanied with the use of a slide , wind instruments without valves or stops ( such as the trombone or slide whistle ) , tim ##pani ( kettle ##drum ##s ) , electronic instruments ( such as the there ##min , the on ##des mart ##eno ##t , synthesizers and key ##tar ##s ) , the water organ , and the human voice . [SEP]
[CLS] brass and wood ##wind instruments such as the trumpet or flute can effect a similar limited slide by altering the lip pressure ( trumpet ) or a combination of em ##bo ##uch ##ure and rolling the head joint ( flute ) , while the clarinet and some models of flute can achieve this by slowly dragging fingers off tone holes or changing the oral cavity ' s resonance by manipulating tongue position , em ##bo ##uch ##ure , and throat shaping . [SEP]
[CLS] many electric guitars are fitted with a tre ##mo ##lo arm which can produce either a port ##ament ##o , a vi ##bra ##to , or a combination of both ( but not a true tre ##mo ##lo despite the name ) . [SEP]
[CLS] bent notes are commonly played on fr ##ette ##d instruments , literally by bending the string with excess finger pressure , or on free reed instruments such as the harmonica , by using excess air pressure to over ##bl ##ow the reed . [SEP]
