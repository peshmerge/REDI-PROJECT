[CLS] paolo uc ##cel ##lo ( , ] ; 139 ##7 – 10 december 147 ##5 ) , born paolo di don ##o , was a fl ##ore ##ntine painter and mathematician who was notable for his pioneering work on visual perspective in art . [SEP]
[CLS] in his book " lives of the most excellent painters , sculptors , and architects " giorgio va ##sari wrote that uc ##cel ##lo was obsessed by his interest in perspective and would stay up all night in his study trying to grasp the exact vanishing point . [SEP]
[CLS] while his contemporaries used perspective to na ##rra ##te different or succeeding stories , uc ##cel ##lo used perspective to create a feeling of depth in his paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] his best known works are the three paintings representing the battle of san romano , which were wrongly entitled the " battle of sant ' e ##gi ##dio of 141 ##6 " for a long period of time . [SEP]
[CLS] paolo worked in the late gothic tradition , emphasizing colour and pageant ##ry rather than the classical realism that other artists were pioneering . [SEP]
[CLS] his style is best described as id ##ios ##yn ##cratic , and he left no school of followers . [SEP]
[CLS] he has had some influence on twentieth - century art and literary criticism ( e . g . , in the " vie ##s im ##agi ##naire ##s " by marcel sc ##h ##wo ##b , " uc ##cel ##lo le po ##il " by anton ##in art ##aud and " o mundo como id ##eia " by bruno to ##lent ##ino ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the sources for paolo uc ##cel ##lo ’ s life are few : giorgio va ##sari ’ s biography , written 75 years after paolo ’ s death , and a few contemporary official documents . [SEP]
[CLS] due to the lack of sources , even his date of birth is questionable . [SEP]
[CLS] it is believed that uc ##cel ##lo was born in pr ##ato ##ve ##cchi ##o in 139 ##7 , and his tax declaration ##s for some years indicate that he was born in 139 ##7 , but in 144 ##6 he claimed to have been born in 139 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] his father , don ##o di paolo , was a barber - surgeon from pr ##ato ##ve ##cchi ##o near are ##zzo ; his mother , antonia , was a high - born fl ##ore ##ntine . [SEP]
[CLS] his nickname " uc ##cel ##lo " came from his fond ##ness for painting birds . [SEP]
[CLS] from 141 ##2 until 141 ##6 he was apprentice ##d to the famous sculptor lorenzo g ##hi ##bert ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] g ##hi ##bert ##i was the designer of the doors of the florence baptiste ##ry and his workshop was the premier centre for fl ##ore ##ntine art at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] g ##hi ##bert ##i ' s late - gothic , narrative style and sc ##ul ##pt ##ural composition greatly influenced paolo . [SEP]
[CLS] it was also around this time that paolo began his lifelong friendship with donate ##llo . [SEP]
[CLS] in 141 ##4 , uc ##cel ##lo was admitted to the painters ' guild , " com ##pa ##gni ##a di san luca , " and just one year later , in 141 ##5 , he joined the official painter ' s guild of florence " arte dei medici e de ##gli sp ##ez ##ial ##i " . [SEP]
[CLS] although the young uc ##cel ##lo had probably left g ##hi ##bert ##i ' s workshop by the mid 142 ##0s , he stayed on good terms with his master and may have been privy to the designs for g ##hi ##bert ##i ' s second set of baptiste ##ry doors , " the gates of paradise . " [SEP]
[CLS] these featured a battle scene " that might well have impressed itself in the mind of the young uc ##cel ##lo , " and thus influenced " the battle of san romano " . [SEP]
[CLS] according to va ##sari , uc ##cel ##lo ’ s first painting was a saint anthony between the saints co ##sma ##s and damian ##us , a commission for the hospital of le ##lm ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] next , he painted two figures in the convent of anna ##lena . [SEP]
[CLS] shortly afterwards , he painted three frescoes with scenes from " the life of saint francis " above the left door of the santa tri ##ni ##ta church . [SEP]
[CLS] for the santa maria mag ##gio ##re church , he painted a fresco of the ann ##unciation . [SEP]
[CLS] in this fresco , he painted a large building with columns in perspective . [SEP]
[CLS] according to va ##sari , people found this to be a great and beautiful achievement because this was the first example of how lines could be expert ##ly used to demonstrate perspective and size . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , this work became a model for artists who wished to craft illusions of space in order to enhance the real ##ness of their paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] paolo painted " the lives of the church fathers " in the cl ##ois ##ters of the church of san mini ##ato , which sat on a hill overlooking florence . [SEP]
[CLS] according to va ##sari , paolo protested against the mono ##ton ##ous meals of cheese pie ##s and cheese soup served by the abbot by running away , and returned to finish the job only after the abbot promised him a more varied diet . [SEP]
[CLS] uc ##cel ##lo was asked to paint a number of scenes of di ##ste ##mp ##ered animals for the house of the medici . [SEP]
[CLS] the scene most appreciated by va ##sari was his depiction of a fierce lion fighting with a venom - sp ##out ##ing snake . [SEP]
[CLS] uc ##cel ##lo loved to paint animals and he kept a wide variety of pictures of animals , especially birds , at home . [SEP]
[CLS] this love for birds is what led to his nickname , paolo uc ##cel ##li ( paul of the birds ) . [SEP]
[CLS] by 142 ##4 , paolo was earning his own living as a painter . [SEP]
[CLS] in that year , he proved his artistic maturity by painting episodes of the " creation and expulsion , " which are now badly damaged , for the green cl ##ois ##ter ( " chi ##ost ##ro verde " ) of santa maria novella in florence . [SEP]
[CLS] again , this assignment allowed him to paint a large number of animals in a lively manner . [SEP]
[CLS] he also succeeded in painting trees in their natural colours . [SEP]
[CLS] this was a skill that was difficult for many of his predecessors , so uc ##cel ##lo also began to acquire a reputation for painting landscapes . [SEP]
[CLS] he continued with scenes from the del ##uge , the story of noah ' s ark , noah ' s sacrifice and noah ' s drunken ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] these scenes brought him great fame in florence . [SEP]
[CLS] in 142 ##5 , uc ##cel ##lo travelled to venice , where he worked on the mosaic ##s for the facade of san marco , which have all since been lost . [SEP]
[CLS] during this time , he also painted some frescoes in the pr ##ato cathedral and bologna . [SEP]
[CLS] some suggest he visited rome with his friend donate ##llo before returning to florence in 143 ##1 . [SEP]
[CLS] after he returned , uc ##cel ##lo remained in florence for most of the rest of his life , executing works for various churches and patrons , most notably the duo ##mo . [SEP]
[CLS] despite his leave from florence , interest in uc ##cel ##lo did not dim ##ini ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] in 143 ##2 , the office of works asked the fl ##ore ##ntine ambassador in venice to en ##qui ##re after uc ##cel ##lo ’ s reputation as an artist . [SEP]
[CLS] in 143 ##6 , he was given the commission for the mono ##ch ##romatic fresco of " sir john hawk ##wood " . [SEP]
[CLS] this equestrian monument exemplified his keen interest in perspective . [SEP]
[CLS] the condo ##tti ##ere and his horse are presented as if the fresco was a sculpture seen from below . [SEP]
[CLS] it is widely thought that he is the author of the frescoes " stories of the virgin " and " story of saint stephen " in the cappella dell ' ass ##unt ##a , florence , so he likely visited nearby pr ##ato sometime between 143 ##5 and 144 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] later , in 144 ##3 , he painted the figures on the clock of the duo ##mo . [SEP]
[CLS] in that same year and continuing into 144 ##4 , he designed a few stained glass windows for the same church . [SEP]
[CLS] in 144 ##4 he was also at work in padua , and he travelled to padua again in 144 ##5 at donate ##llo ’ s invitation . [SEP]
[CLS] back in florence in 144 ##6 , he painted the " green stations of the cross " , again for the cl ##ois ##ter of the church santa maria novella . [SEP]
[CLS] around 144 ##7 – 145 ##4 he painted " scenes of monastic life " for the church san mini ##ato al monte , florence . [SEP]
[CLS] around the mid - 145 ##0s , he painted his three most famous paintings , the panels depicting " the battle of san romano " for the palazzo medici in florence , commemorating the victory of the fl ##ore ##ntine army over the si ##enes ##e in 143 ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the extra ##ord ##ina ##rily fore ##sho ##rte ##ned forms extending in many planes accent ##uate uc ##cel ##lo ' s vi ##rt ##uo ##sity as a drafts ##man , and provides a controlled visual structure to the chaos of the battle scene . [SEP]
[CLS] by 145 ##3 , uc ##cel ##lo was married to tom ##mas ##a mali ##fi ##ci . [SEP]
[CLS] this is known because , in that year dona ##to ( named after donate ##llo ) , was born . [SEP]
[CLS] three years later , in 145 ##6 , his wife gave birth to their daughter , antonia . [SEP]
[CLS] antonia uc ##cel ##lo ( 145 ##6 – 149 ##1 ) was a carmel ##ite nun , whom giorgio va ##sari called " a daughter who knew how to draw . " [SEP]
[CLS] she was even noted as a " pitt ##ores ##sa " , a painter , on her death certificate . [SEP]
[CLS] her style and her skill remains a mystery as none of her work is extant . [SEP]
[CLS] from 146 ##5 to 146 ##9 , uc ##cel ##lo was in ur ##bino with his son dona ##to working for the con ##fra ##tern ##ity of corpus dom ##ini , a brotherhood of lay ##men . [SEP]
[CLS] during this time , he painted the pre ##dell ##a for their new altar ##piece with the " miracle of the prof ##ane ##d host . " [SEP]
[CLS] ( the main panel representing the " communion of the apostles " was commissioned to just ##us van ghent and finished in 147 ##4 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] uc ##cel ##lo ' s pre ##dell ##a is composed of six met ##ic ##ulous , naturalist ##ic scenes related to the anti ##se ##mit ##ic myth of host des ##ec ##ration , which was based upon an event that supposedly occurred in paris in 129 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been suggested that the subject of the main panel , on which duke frederick of monte ##felt ##ro of ur ##bino appears in the background con ##vers ##ing with an asian , is related to the anti ##se ##mit ##ic intention of the pre ##dell ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] however , federico did allow a small jewish community to live in ur ##bino and not all of these scenes are unanimously attributed to paolo uc ##cel ##lo . [SEP]
[CLS] in his fl ##ore ##ntine tax return of august 146 ##9 , uc ##cel ##lo declared , “ i find myself old and ai ##ling , my wife is ill , and i can no longer work . ” [SEP]
[CLS] in the last years of his life , paolo was a lone ##some and forgotten man who was afraid of hardship in life . [SEP]
[CLS] his last known work is " the hunt " , c . 147 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] he made his testament on 11 november 147 ##5 and died shortly afterwards on 10 december 147 ##5 at the hospital of florence , at the age of 78 . [SEP]
[CLS] he was buried in his father ’ s tomb in the fl ##ore ##ntine church of santo spirit ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] with his precise and analytical mind , paolo uc ##cel ##lo tried to apply a scientific method to depict objects in three - dimensional space . [SEP]
[CLS] in particular , some of his studies of the perspective fore ##sho ##rte ##ning of the tor ##us are preserved , and one standard display of drawing skill was his depiction of the ma ##zzo ##cchi ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] in the words of g . c . ar ##gan : " paolo ' s rig ##our is similar to the rig ##our of cub ##ists in the early 20th century , whose images were more " true " when they were less " true to life " . [SEP]
[CLS] paolo construct ##s space through perspective , and historic event through the structure of space ; if the resulting image is unnatural and un ##real ##istic , so much the worse for nature and history . " [SEP]
[CLS] the perspective in his paintings has influenced many famous painters , such as pier ##o della francesca , albrecht du ##rer and leonardo da vinci , to name a few . [SEP]
[CLS] pope - hen ##nessy is far more conservative than the italian authors : he attributes some of the works below to a " pr ##ato master " and a " karlsruhe master " . [SEP]
[CLS] most of the dates in the list ( taken from bo ##rs ##i and bo ##rs ##i ) are derived from stylistic comparison rather than from documentation . [SEP]
