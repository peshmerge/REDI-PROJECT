[CLS] in quantum mechanics , the uncertainty principle ( also known as he ##isen ##berg ' s uncertainty principle ) is any of a variety of mathematical in ##e ##qual ##ities asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle , known as complementary variables or canonical ##ly con ##ju ##gate variables such as position " x " and momentum " p " , can be known or , depending on interpretation , to what extent such con ##ju ##gate properties maintain their approximate meaning , as the mathematical framework of quantum physics does not support the notion of simultaneously well - defined con ##ju ##gate properties expressed by a single value . [SEP]
[CLS] introduced first in 1927 , by the german physicist werner he ##isen ##berg , it states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined , the less precisely its momentum can be known , and vice versa . [SEP]
[CLS] the formal inequality relating the standard deviation of position " σ " and the standard deviation of momentum " σ " was derived by earle hesse ken ##nard later that year and by hermann we ##yl in 1928 : where ħ is the reduced planck constant , " h " / ( 2 ##π ) . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , the uncertainty principle has been confused with a related effect in physics , called the observer effect , which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems , that is , without changing something in a system . [SEP]
[CLS] it has since become clearer , however , that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all wave - like systems , and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , " the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems and is not a statement about the observation ##al success of current technology " . [SEP]
[CLS] it must be emphasized that " measurement " does not mean only a process in which a physicist - observer takes part , but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer . [SEP]
[CLS] the wave mechanics picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive , but the more abstract matrix mechanics picture formula ##tes it in a way that general ##izes more easily . [SEP]
[CLS] mathematical ##ly , in wave mechanics , the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wave ##fu ##nction in the two corresponding or ##th ##ono ##rma ##l bases in hilbert space are fourier transforms of one another ( i . e . , position and momentum are con ##ju ##gate variables ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar trade ##off between the variance ##s of fourier con ##ju ##gate ##s arises in all systems under ##lain by fourier analysis , for example in sound waves : a pure tone is a sharp spike at a single frequency , while its fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain , which is a completely del ##oca ##lized sin ##e wave . [SEP]
[CLS] in quantum mechanics , the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a matter wave , and momentum is its fourier con ##ju ##gate , assured by the de bro ##gli ##e relation , where k is the wave ##num ##ber . [SEP]
[CLS] the time - independent wave function of a single - mode ##d plane wave of wave ##num ##ber " k " or momentum " p " is [SEP]
[CLS] the born rule states that this should be interpreted as a probability density amplitude function in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between " a " and " b " is [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of the single - mode ##d plane wave , formula _ 4 is a uniform distribution . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , consider a wave function that is a sum of many waves , which we may write this as [SEP]
[CLS] where " a " represents the relative contribution of the mode " p " to the overall total . [SEP]
[CLS] we may take this a step further to the continuum limit , where the wave function is an integral over all possible modes [SEP]
[CLS] with formula _ 7 representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in momentum space . [SEP]
[CLS] adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost , namely the momentum has become less precise , having become a mixture of waves of many different moment ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] click the " show " button below to see a semi - formal derivation of the ken ##nard inequality using wave mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] in matrix mechanics , ob ##ser ##vable ##s such as position and momentum are represented by self - ad ##jo ##int operators . [SEP]
[CLS] for a pair of operators a and b , one defines their com ##mut ##ator as in the case of position and momentum , the com ##mut ##ator is the canonical com ##mut ##ation relation [SEP]
[CLS] the physical meaning of the non - com ##mut ##ati ##vity can be understood by considering the effect of the com ##mut ##ator on position and momentum e ##igen ##sta ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] by definition , this means that formula _ 14 applying the com ##mut ##ator to formula _ 13 yields where i is the identity operator . [SEP]
[CLS] if this were true , then one could write on the other hand , the above canonical com ##mut ##ation relation requires that this implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be both a position and a momentum e ##igen ##sta ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] this means that the state is " not " a momentum e ##igen ##sta ##te , however , but rather it can be represented as a sum of multiple momentum basis e ##igen ##sta ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] this precision may be quan ##ti ##fied by the standard deviation ##s , [SEP]
[CLS] as in the wave mechanics interpretation above , one sees a trade ##off between the respective precision ##s of the two , quan ##ti ##fied by the uncertainty principle . [SEP]
[CLS] for a pair of operators formula _ 25 and formula _ 26 , we may define their " com ##mut ##ator " as [SEP]
[CLS] in this notation , the robertson uncertainty relation is given by [SEP]
[CLS] the robertson uncertainty relation immediately follows from a slightly stronger inequality , the " sc ##hr ##od ##inger uncertainty relation " , where we have introduced the " anti ##com ##mut ##ator " , [SEP]
[CLS] since the robertson and sc ##hr ##od ##inger relations are for general operators , the relations can be applied to any two ob ##ser ##vable ##s to obtain specific uncertainty relations . [SEP]
[CLS] a few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below . [SEP]
[CLS] suppose we consider a quantum particle on a ring , where the wave function depends on an angular variable formula _ 41 , which we may take to lie in the interval formula _ 42 . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , in the state formula _ 52 , the uncertainty of formula _ 58 is zero and the uncertainty of formula _ 59 is finite , so that although this result appears to violate the robertson uncertainty principle , the paradox is resolved when we note that formula _ 52 is not in the domain of the operator formula _ 62 , since multiplication by formula _ 41 disrupt ##s the periodic boundary conditions imposed on formula _ 26 . [SEP]
[CLS] ( these also fur ##nish an example of operators satisfying the canonical com ##mut ##ation relations but not the we ##yl relations . ) [SEP]
[CLS] using the standard rules for creation and ann ##ih ##ilation operators on the e ##igen ##sta ##tes of the q ##ho , the variance ##s may be computed directly , the product of these standard deviation ##s is then [SEP]
[CLS] in particular , the above ken ##nard bound is saturated for the ground state , for which the probability density is just the normal distribution . [SEP]
[CLS] in a quantum harmonic os ##ci ##lla ##tor of characteristic angular frequency ω , place a state that is offset from the bottom of the potential by some displacement " x " as where ω describes the width of the initial state but need not be the same as ω . [SEP]
[CLS] through integration over the , we can solve for the full time - dependent solution . [SEP]
[CLS] after many cancel ##ations , the probability den ##sities reduce to where we have used the notation formula _ 85 to denote a normal distribution of mean μ and variance σ . [SEP]
[CLS] copying the variance ##s above and applying tri ##gon ##ometric identities , we can write the product of the standard deviation ##s as [SEP]
[CLS] we can conclude the following : ( the right most equality holds only when ω = " ω " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a coherent state is a right e ##igen ##sta ##te of the ann ##ih ##ilation operator , which may be represented in terms of f ##ock states as [SEP]
[CLS] one expects that the factor " ce " may be replaced by " ce " , which is only known if either s or σ is convex . [SEP]
[CLS] the mathematician g . h . hardy formulated the following uncertainty principle : it is not possible for f and ƒ to both be " very rapidly decreasing " . [SEP]
[CLS] this result was stated in be ##ur ##ling ' s complete works without proof and proved in ho ##rman ##der ( the case formula _ 99 ) and bon ##ami , dem ##ange , and jam ##ing for the general case . [SEP]
[CLS] the central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level , as electrons in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits . [SEP]
[CLS] rather , their motion is smeared out in a strange way : the fourier transform of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##isen ##berg ' s paper did not admit any uno ##bs ##er ##vable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time ; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the fourier components of the motion . [SEP]
[CLS] since the fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies , they could not be used to construct an exact trajectory , so that the formal ##ism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going . [SEP]
[CLS] in march 1926 , working in bo ##hr ' s institute , he ##isen ##berg realized that the non - com ##mut ##ati ##vity implies the uncertainty principle . [SEP]
[CLS] this implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non - com ##mut ##ati ##vity , and it laid the foundation for what became known as the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##isen ##berg showed that the com ##mut ##ation relation implies an uncertainty , or in bo ##hr ' s language a complement ##ari ##ty . [SEP]
[CLS] any two variables that do not com ##mute cannot be measured simultaneously — the more precisely one is known , the less precisely the other can be known . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##isen ##berg wrote : it can be expressed in its simplest form as follows : one can never know with perfect accuracy both of those two important factors which determine the movement of one of the smallest particles — its position and its velocity . [SEP]
[CLS] it is impossible to determine accurately " both " the position and the direction and speed of a particle " at the same instant " . [SEP]
[CLS] in his celebrated 1927 paper , " uber den an ##sch ##au ##liche ##n in ##hal ##t der quan ##ten ##the ##ore ##tis ##chen kin ##ema ##ti ##k und me ##chan ##ik " ( " on the per ##ce ##pt ##ual content of quantum theoretical kin ##ema ##tics and mechanics " ) , he ##isen ##berg established this expression as the minimum amount of una ##vo ##ida ##ble momentum disturbance caused by any position measurement , but he did not give a precise definition for the uncertain ##ties δ ##x and δ ##p . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##isen ##berg only proved relation ( 2 ) for the special case of ga ##uss ##ian states . [SEP]
[CLS] when the english - language version of he ##isen ##berg ' s textbook , " the physical principles of the quantum theory " , was published in 1930 , however , the translation " uncertainty " was used , and it became the more commonly used term in the english language thereafter . [SEP]
[CLS] the principle is quite counter - intuitive , so the early students of quantum theory had to be reassured that naive measurements to violate it were bound always to be un ##work ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] one way in which he ##isen ##berg originally illustrated the intrinsic imp ##oss ##ibility of violating the uncertainty principle is by utilizing the observer effect of an imaginary microscope as a measuring device . [SEP]
[CLS] the combination of these trade - offs implies that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used , the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit , which is ( up to a small numerical factor ) equal to planck ' s constant . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##isen ##berg did not care to formula ##te the uncertainty principle as an exact limit ( which is elaborated below ) , and preferred to use it instead , as a he ##uri ##stic quantitative statement , correct up to small numerical factors , which makes the radically new non ##com ##mut ##ati ##vity of quantum mechanics inevitable . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics , there is no fundamental reality that the quantum state describes , just a prescription for calculating experimental results . [SEP]
[CLS] albert einstein believed that random ##ness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality , while ni ##els bo ##hr believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and ir ##red ##ucible , and depend on which measurements we choose to perform . [SEP]
[CLS] this introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to , and if the wall ' s momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil , the slit ' s position is uncertain enough to di ##sal ##low a position measurement . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein argued that " he ##isen ##berg ' s uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy , the product of the two being related to planck ' s constant . " [SEP]
[CLS] the box could be weighed before a clock ##work mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape . [SEP]
[CLS] in this manner , said einstein , one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision , in contradiction to the uncertainty principle . " [SEP]
[CLS] bo ##hr spent a sleep ##less night considering this argument , and eventually realized that it was flawed . [SEP]
[CLS] he pointed out that if the box were to be weighed , say by a spring and a pointer on a scale , " since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight , there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth ' s surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock , " because of einstein ' s own theory of gravity ' s effect on time . [SEP]
[CLS] " through this chain of uncertain ##ties , bo ##hr showed that einstein ' s light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape . " [SEP]
[CLS] bo ##hr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by einstein . [SEP]
[CLS] this example led bo ##hr to rev ##ise his understanding of the principle , concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction . [SEP]
[CLS] he believed the " natural basic assumption " that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from " locally changing deter ##mini ##stic quantities " and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1964 , john bell showed that this assumption can be fa ##ls ##ified , since it would imply a certain inequality between the pro ##ba ##bilities of different experiments . [SEP]
[CLS] experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics , ruling out einstein ' s basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his " hidden variables " . [SEP]
[CLS] these hidden variables may be " hidden " because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small . [SEP]
[CLS] the question of whether a random outcome is pre ##de ##ter ##mined by a non ##lo ##cal theory can be philosophical , and it can be potentially intra ##ctable . [SEP]
[CLS] if the hidden variables are not constrained , they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes . [SEP]
[CLS] to make it sensible , the assumption of non ##lo ##cal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption — that the size of the ob ##ser ##vable universe puts a limit on the computation ##s that these variables can do . [SEP]
[CLS] a non ##lo ##cal theory of this sort predict ##s that a quantum computer would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10 , 000 digits or more ; a potentially ac ##hi ##eva ##ble task in quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] he disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to ensembles of identical ##ly prepared particles , referring to them as " statistical sc ##atter relations " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1934 , pop ##per published " zur k ##rit ##ik der un ##gen ##au ##ig ##kei ##ts ##rel ##ation ##en " ( " critique of the uncertainty relations " ) in " nat ##ur ##wi ##ssen ##schaft ##en " , and in the same year " log ##ik der for ##sch ##ung " ( translated and updated by the author as " the logic of scientific discovery " in 1959 ) , out ##lining his arguments for the statistical interpretation . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1982 , he further developed his theory in " quantum theory and the sc ##hism in physics " , writing : he ##isen ##berg ' s formula ##e are , beyond all doubt , der ##iva ##ble " statistical formula ##e " of the quantum theory . [SEP]
[CLS] but they have been " habit ##ually mis ##int ##er ##pre ##ted " by those quantum theorists who said that these formula ##e can be interpreted as determining some upper limit to the " precision of our measurements " . [SEP]
[CLS] pop ##per proposed an experiment to fa ##ls ##ify the uncertainty relations , although he later withdrew his initial version after discussions with wei ##z ##sack ##er , he ##isen ##berg , and einstein ; this experiment may have influenced the formulation of the ep ##r experiment . [SEP]
[CLS] the many - worlds interpretation originally outlined by hugh everett iii in 1957 is partly meant to reconcile the differences between einstein ' s and bo ##hr ' s views by replacing bo ##hr ' s wave function collapse with an ensemble of deter ##mini ##stic and independent universe ##s whose " distribution " is governed by wave functions and the sc ##hr ##od ##inger equation . [SEP]
[CLS] some scientists including arthur compton and martin he ##isen ##berg have suggested that the uncertainty principle , or at least the general pro ##ba ##bilis ##tic nature of quantum mechanics , could be evidence for the two - stage model of free will . [SEP]
[CLS] one critique , however , is that apart from the basic role of quantum mechanics as a foundation for chemistry , non ##tri ##vial biological mechanisms requiring quantum mechanics are unlikely , due to the rapid deco ##her ##ence time of quantum systems at room temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] there is reason to believe that violating the uncertainty principle also strongly implies the violation of the second law of the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mics . [SEP]
