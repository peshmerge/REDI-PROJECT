in quantum mechanics , the uncertainty principle is a set of rules that determine the effects of the particle , such as the position " x " and momentum , can be defined by the notion of the fact that the particle can be defined by the fact that the universe is not .
werner heisenberg , a german physicist , first discovered the first position in 1927 .
the formal inequality relating the standard deviation of position " σ " and the standard deviation of momentum " σ " was derived by earle hesse kennard later that year and by hermann weyl in 1928 : where ħ is the reduced planck constant , " h " / 2am " .
the uncertainty principle is also confused with the " observer effect " .
heisenberg used such an observer effect at the quantum level hamas .
it is clearer , however , that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all wave-like systems , and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects .
the uncertainty principle is a statement about the observational success of current technology .
it must be emphasized that " measurement " does not mean only a process in which a physicist-observer takes part , but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer .
the uncertainty principle is such a basic result in quantum mechanics .
some experiments , however , may deliberately test a particular form of the uncertainty principle as part of their main research program .
tests of number – phase uncertainty relations in superconducting or quantum optics systems are examples .
applications depend on the uncertainty principle for their operation include extremely low-noise technology such as that required in gravitational wave interferometers .
the uncertainty principle is not apparent on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience .
so it is helpful to demonstrate how it applies to more easily understood physical situations .
two other frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle .
the wave mechanics picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive .
in wave mechanics , the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding orthonormal bases in hilbert space are fourier transforms of one another .
a nonzero function and its fourier transform fourier transform baja california -lrb- ~ the same -rrb- are both localized .
a similar tradeoff between the variances of fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by fourier analysis .
in quantum mechanics , the two key points are that the position of a matter wave takes the form of a matter wave , and momentum is its fourier conjugate , assured by the de broglie relation , where k is the wavenumber .
in matrix mechanics , the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics , any pair of non-commuting self-adjoint operators representing observables are subject to similar uncertainty limits .
an eigenstate of an observable is the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement valuehesis .
for example , if a measure of an observable a is performed , then the system is in a particular eigenstate ψ of that observable .
if so , then it does not have a unique connection measurement for it .
the de broglie hypothesis says that every object in the universe is a wave , i . e . , a situation which gives rise to this phenomenon .
the position of the particle is described by a wave function .
the wave of wavenumber formula _ 1 is the momentum of a wave function .
the born rule says that the probability of finding the particle between " a " and " b " is probability .
in the case of the single-moded plane wave , formula _ 4 is a uniform distribution .
in other words , the particle position is extremely uncertain .
on the other hand , consider a wave function that is a sum of many waves , which we may write this as
where " a " represents the relative contribution of the mode " p " to the overall total .
the figures to the right show how many plane waves are added , the wave packet can become more localized .
we may take this a step further to the continuum limit , where the wave function is an integral over all possible modes .
the wave is called the wave function in momentum space .
we say that formula _ 7 is the fourier transform of formula _ 9 and that " x " and " p " are conjugate variables .
adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost , namely the momentum has become a mixture of many different momenta .
one way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the standard deviation " σ " .
since formula _ 4 is a probability density function for position , we calculate its standard deviation .
the precision of the position is improved , i . e . reduced σ , by using many plane waves , thereby weakening the precision of the momentum , i . e . increased σ .
another way of saying this is that σ and σ have an inverse relationship or are at least bounded from below .
this is the uncertainty principle , the exact limit of which is the kennard bound .
click the " show " button below to see a semi-formal derivation of the kennard inequality using wave mechanics .
in matrix mechanics , observables such as position and momentum are represented by self-adjoint operators .
if considering pairs of observables , an important quantity is the " commutator " .
for a pair of operators a and b , one defines their commutator as in the case of position and momentum , the commutator is the canonical commutation relation .
the physical meaning of the non-commutativity can be understood by considering the effect of the commutator on position and momentum eigenstates .
let formula _ 13 be a right eigenstate of position with a constant eigenvalue " x " .
by definition , this means that formula _ 14 applying the commutator to formula _ 13 yields where i is the identity operator .
suppose , for the sake of proof by contradiction , that formula _ 13 is also a right eigenstate of momentum , with constant eigenvalue " p " .
if we could write , then one could write on the other hand , the above canonical commutation relation requires that this implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be both a position and a momentum eigenstate .
when a state is measured , it is projected onto an eigenstate in the basis of the observable observable .
for example , if a particle 's position is measured , then the state is eigenstate .
this means that the state is " not " a momentum eigenstate , however , but rather it can be represented as a sum of multiple momentum basis eigenstates .
in other words , the momentum is less accurate .
this precision may be quantified by the standard deviations , and the standard deviations are quantified .
as in the wave mechanics interpretation above , one sees a tradeoff between the respective precisions of the two , quantified by the uncertainty principle .
the most common form of the uncertainty principle is the robertson uncertainty relation .
for an arbitrary hermitian operator , we can associate a standard deviation .
where the brackets formula _ 12 indicate an expectation value .
for a pair of operators , we may define their commutator as
the robertson uncertainty relation is given by
the robertson uncertainty relation immediately follows from a slightly stronger inequality , the schrodinger uncertainty relation , where we have introduced the " anticommutator " ,
since the robertson and schrodinger relations are for general operators , the relations can be applied to any two observables to obtain specific uncertainty relations .
a few of the most common relations in the literature are below .
suppose we consider a quantum particle on a ring , where the wave function depends on an angular variable formula _ 41 , which we may take to lie in the interval formula _ 13 .
define " position " and " momentum " operators " , and " y " by " m " .
where we impose periodic boundary conditions on formula _ 26 .
note that the definition of formula _ 12 depends on our choice to have formula _ 17 range from 0 to formula _ 5 .
these operators satisfy the usual commutation relations for position and momentum operators , formula _ 13 .
now let formula _ 13 be any of the eigenstates of formula _ 26 , which are given by formula _ 5 .
note that these states are normalizable , unlike the eigenstates of the momentum operator on the line .
note also that the operator is bounded , since formula _ 41 ranges over a bounded interval .
in the state formula _ 19 , the uncertainty of formula _ 13 is zero and the uncertainty of formula _ 19 is finite .
the derivation of the robertson relation , which requires formula _ 17 and formula _ 18 to be defined , does not apply .
although these also furnish an example of operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations but not the weyl relations .
for the usual position and momentum operators formula _ 22 and formula _ 68 on the real line , no such counterexamples can occur .
the heisenberg uncertainty principle holds , even if formula _ 22 fails to be in the domain of formula _ 14 or of formula _ 7 .

in particular , the above kennard bound is saturated for the ground state , for which the probability density is just the normal distribution .
in a quantum harmonic oscillator of characteristic angular frequency ω , the state that is offset from the bottom of the potential by some displacement " x " as where ω describes the width of the initial state but need not be the same as ω .
it can be integration over the whole solution .
after many cancelations , the probability densities reduce to where we have used the notation formula _ 85 to denote a normal distribution of mean μ and variance σ .
copying the variances above and applying trigonometric identities , we can write the product of the standard deviations as
we can conclude the following : ω = ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω ω
a coherent state is a right eigenstate of the annihilation operator .
one expects that the factor " ce " may be replaced by " ce " .
the mathematician g . h . hardy formulated the uncertainty principle : it is not possible for f and omega to both be " very rapidly decreasing " .
specifically , if formula _ 12 is such that and formula _ 5 is such that
then , if " ab " > 1 , " f " = 0 , while " ab " = 1 , then " ab " = 1 , then " n " such that
this was later improved as follows : if formula _ 18 is such that
then where formula _ 2 is a real " d " × " positive definite matrix .
this result was stated in beurling 's complete works without proof .
the version by bonami – demange – jaming covers the full strength of hardy 's theorem .
a different proof of beurling 's theorem was published in ref .
a full description of the case " ab " < 1 as well as the following extension to schwartz class distributions appears in ref .
if a tempered distribution formula _ 1 is such that
then for some convenient polynomial p and real positive definite matrix a of type " d " × " d " .
werner heisenberg formulated the uncertainty principle at niels bohr 's institute in copenhagen , while working on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics .
in 1925 heisenberg developed matrix mechanics , which replaced the ad hoc old quantum theory with modern quantum mechanics .
the central idea was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level , as electrons in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits .
rather , their motion is smeared out in a strange way : the fourier transform of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation .
heisenberg 's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the position of the electron in an orbit at any time .
since the fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies , they could not be used to make an exact path .
in march 1926 , heisenberg realized that the non-commutativity implies the uncertainty principle .
it laid the foundation for what became known as the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics .
heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty , or in bohr 's language a complementarity .
any two variables that do not commutescent be measured at the same time , the less precisely the other can be known .
heisenberg wrote : it can be expressed in its simplest form as follows : one can never know with perfect accuracy both of those two factors which determine the movement of one of the smallest particles — its position and its velocity .
it is impossible to know accurately " both " the position and the direction and speed of a particle " at the same instant " .
in his 1927 paper " uber den anschaulichen inhalt der quantentheoretischen kinematik und mechanik " showed that the perceptual content of quantum theoretical kinematics and mechanics " showed that the total momentum of unavoidable position was caused by δ , but did not give the precise definition .
instead , he gave some plausible estimates in each case separately .
where , and σ are the standard deviations of position and momentum .
heisenberg only proved relation wagner wagner 2stituting the special case of gaussian states .
heisenberg used the word " ungenauigkeit " whenever he invented .
only in the endnote did he switch to the word , " unsicherheit " opener " uncertainty "lity .
when the english-language version of heisenberg 's textbook , " the physical principles of the quantum theory " , was published in 1930 , however , the translation " uncertainty " was used .
the principle is quite counter-intuitive , so the early students of quantum theory had to be reassured that naive measurements would violate it always be unworkable .
one way in which heisenberg first illustrated the intrinsic impossibility of violating the uncertainty principle is by using the observer effect of an imaginary microscope as a measuring device .
he imagines an experimenter trying to measure the position and momentum of an electron by shooting a photon at it .
the combination of these trade-offs implies that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used , the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit , which is equivalent to planck 's constant .
heisenberg did not care to formulate the uncertainty principle as an exact limit limit limit exceedsability .
the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and heisenberg 's uncertainty principle were , in fact , seen as twin targets by detractors who believed in an underlying determinism and realism .
the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics says that there is no basic reality that the quantum state describes .
there is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is , only what the result of observations might be .
albert einstein believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality .
einstein and bohr had an uncertainty principle .
bohr 's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well , and that to measure the recoil to accuracy δ " p " , the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through .
this introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to , and if the wall 's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil , the slit 's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position .
a similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by richard feynman .
bohr was present when einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as einstein 's box .
einstein argued that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy , the product of the two being related to planck 's constant .
he said , an ideal box , lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely .
the box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape .
we now know , explained einstein , precisely the time at which the photon left the box . "
now , the box is again taken in the box .
the change of mass tells how much the light is made of the material .
einstein said that the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision , in contradiction to the uncertainty principle .
bohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument .
he pointed out that if the box were to be weighed , say by a spring and a pointer on a scale , " since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight , there will be uncertainty in its height above the table .
the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth 's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock , " because of einstein 's own theory of gravity 's effect on time .
" through this chain of uncertainties , bohr showed that einstein 's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape . "
bohr was made to change his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by einstein .
in 1935 , einstein , podolsky and rosen [mask] see epr paradox spiders .
measuring one particle , einstein realized , would alter the probability distribution of the other , yet here the other particle could not be disturbed .
bohr decided that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction .
einstein came to far more conclusions from the same thought experiment .
he believed the " natural basic assumption " that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from " locally changing deterministic quantities " .
in 1964 , john bell showed that this idea could be falsified , since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments .
experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics , ruling out einstein 's basic idea that led him to the suggestion of his " hidden variables " .
these variables may be " hidden " , because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small .
this illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations .
this same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles .
both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer .
ironically , this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting karl popper 's philosophy of invalidation of a theory by falsification experiments .
in fact , einstein 's " basic assumption " became falsified by experiments based on bell 's inequalities .
for the objections of karl popper to the heisenberg inequality itself , see below .
this is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists .
the question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a theory can be philosophical , and it can be intractable .
if the variable is not limited , they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes .
to make it sensible , the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption .
a nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a quantum computer would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more .
karl popper approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and metaphysical realist .
he disagreed with the use of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to groups of identically prepared particles .
in this statistical interpretation , a particular measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory .
this is different from the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics , which is non-deterministic but lacks local hidden variables .
in 1934 , popper published " zur kritik der ungenauigkeitsrelationen " critique of the uncertainty relations " .
in 1982 , he further developed his theory in " quantum theory and the schism in physics " .
but they have been " habitually misinterpreted " by those quantum theorists who said that these formulae can be seen as determining some upper limit to the " precision of our measurements " .
popper proposed an experiment to falsify the uncertainty relations , although he later withdrew his initial version after discussions with weizsacker , heisenberg , and einstein .
albert einstein 's and bohr 's views made the many-worlds interpretation of the universe by combining the two worlds from the wave function .
uncertainty in the many-worlds interpretation follows from each observer within any universe having no knowledge of what goes on in the other universe .
some scientists including arthur compton and martin heisenberg have suggested that the uncertainty principle , or at least the general probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics , could be evidence for the two-stage model of free will .
quantum mechanics is a foundation for chemistry , nontrivial biological mechanisms requiring quantum mechanics are unlikely , due to the rapid decoherence time of quantum systems at room temperature .
the standard view is that this decoherence is overcome by both screening and decoherence-free subspaces found in biological cells .
there is a reason to say that violating the uncertainty principle also strongly implies the violation of the second law of thermodynamics .
