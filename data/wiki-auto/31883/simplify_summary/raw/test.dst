In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle (also known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle) is any of a variety of mathematical inequalities asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables or canonically conjugate variables such as position "x" and momentum "p", can be known or, depending on interpretation, to what extent such conjugate properties maintain their approximate meaning, as the mathematical framework of quantum physics does not support the notion of simultaneously well-defined conjugate properties expressed by a single value.
Introduced first in 1927, by the German physicist Werner Heisenberg, it states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa.
The formal inequality relating the standard deviation of position "σ" and the standard deviation of momentum "σ" was derived by Earle Hesse Kennard later that year and by Hermann Weyl in 1928: where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, "h"/(2π ).
Historically, the uncertainty principle has been confused with a related effect in physics, called the observer effect, which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems, that is, without changing something in a system.
Heisenberg utilized such an observer effect at the quantum level (see below) as a physical "explanation" of quantum uncertainty.
It has since become clearer, however, that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all wave-like systems, and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects.
Thus, "the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology".
It must be emphasized that "measurement" does not mean only a process in which a physicist-observer takes part, but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer.
Since the uncertainty principle is such a basic result in quantum mechanics, typical experiments in quantum mechanics routinely observe aspects of it.
Certain experiments, however, may deliberately test a particular form of the uncertainty principle as part of their main research program.
These include, for example, tests of number–phase uncertainty relations in superconducting or quantum optics systems.
Applications dependent on the uncertainty principle for their operation include extremely low-noise technology such as that required in gravitational wave interferometers.
The uncertainty principle is not readily apparent on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience.
So it is helpful to demonstrate how it applies to more easily understood physical situations.
Two alternative frameworks for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle.
The wave mechanics picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive, but the more abstract matrix mechanics picture formulates it in a way that generalizes more easily.
Mathematically, in wave mechanics, the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wavefunction in the two corresponding orthonormal bases in Hilbert space are Fourier transforms of one another (i.e., position and momentum are conjugate variables).
A nonzero function and its Fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized.
A similar tradeoff between the variances of Fourier conjugates arises in all systems underlain by Fourier analysis, for example in sound waves: A pure tone is a sharp spike at a single frequency, while its Fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain, which is a completely delocalized sine wave.
In quantum mechanics, the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a matter wave, and momentum is its Fourier conjugate, assured by the de Broglie relation , where k is the wavenumber.
In matrix mechanics, the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, any pair of non-commuting self-adjoint operators representing observables are subject to similar uncertainty limits.
An eigenstate of an observable represents the state of the wavefunction for a certain measurement value (the eigenvalue).
For example, if a measurement of an observable A is performed, then the system is in a particular eigenstate Ψ of that observable.
However, the particular eigenstate of the observable A need not be an eigenstate of another observable B : If so, then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it, as the system is not in an eigenstate of that observable.
According to the de Broglie hypothesis, every object in the universe is a wave, i.e., a situation which gives rise to this phenomenon.
The position of the particle is described by a wave function formula_1.
The time-independent wave function of a single-moded plane wave of wavenumber "k" or momentum "p" is
The Born rule states that this should be interpreted as a probability density amplitude function in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between "a" and "b" is
In the case of the single-moded plane wave, formula_4 is a uniform distribution.
In other words, the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet.
On the other hand, consider a wave function that is a sum of many waves, which we may write this as
where "A" represents the relative contribution of the mode "p" to the overall total.
The figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves, the wave packet can become more localized.
We may take this a step further to the continuum limit, where the wave function is an integral over all possible modes
with formula_7 representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in momentum space.
In mathematical terms, we say that formula_7 is the "Fourier transform" of formula_9 and that "x" and "p" are conjugate variables.
Adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost, namely the momentum has become less precise, having become a mixture of waves of many different momenta.
One way to quantify the precision of the position and momentum is the standard deviation "σ".
Since formula_4 is a probability density function for position, we calculate its standard deviation.
The precision of the position is improved, i.e. reduced σ, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the precision of the momentum, i.e. increased σ.
Another way of stating this is that σ and σ have an inverse relationship or are at least bounded from below.
This is the uncertainty principle, the exact limit of which is the Kennard bound.
Click the "show" button below to see a semi-formal derivation of the Kennard inequality using wave mechanics.
In matrix mechanics, observables such as position and momentum are represented by self-adjoint operators.
When considering pairs of observables, an important quantity is the "commutator".
For a pair of operators Â and B̂ , one defines their commutator as In the case of position and momentum, the commutator is the canonical commutation relation
The physical meaning of the non-commutativity can be understood by considering the effect of the commutator on position and momentum eigenstates.
Let formula_13 be a right eigenstate of position with a constant eigenvalue "x" .
By definition, this means that formula_14 Applying the commutator to formula_13 yields where Î is the identity operator.
Suppose, for the sake of proof by contradiction, that formula_13 is also a right eigenstate of momentum, with constant eigenvalue "p" .
If this were true, then one could write On the other hand, the above canonical commutation relation requires that This implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be both a position and a momentum eigenstate.
When a state is measured, it is projected onto an eigenstate in the basis of the relevant observable.
For example, if a particle's position is measured, then the state amounts to a position eigenstate.
This means that the state is "not" a momentum eigenstate, however, but rather it can be represented as a sum of multiple momentum basis eigenstates.
In other words, the momentum must be less precise.
This precision may be quantified by the standard deviations,
As in the wave mechanics interpretation above, one sees a tradeoff between the respective precisions of the two, quantified by the uncertainty principle.
The most common general form of the uncertainty principle is the "Robertson uncertainty relation".
For an arbitrary Hermitian operator formula_22 we can associate a standard deviation
where the brackets formula_24 indicate an expectation value.
For a pair of operators formula_25 and formula_26, we may define their "commutator" as
In this notation, the Robertson uncertainty relation is given by
The Robertson uncertainty relation immediately follows from a slightly stronger inequality, the "Schrödinger uncertainty relation", where we have introduced the "anticommutator",
Since the Robertson and Schrödinger relations are for general operators, the relations can be applied to any two observables to obtain specific uncertainty relations.
A few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below.
Suppose we consider a quantum particle on a ring, where the wave function depends on an angular variable formula_41, which we may take to lie in the interval formula_42.
Define "position" and "momentum" operators formula_25 and formula_26 by
where we impose periodic boundary conditions on formula_26.
Note that the definition of formula_25 depends on our choice to have formula_41 range from 0 to formula_50.
These operators satisfy the usual commutation relations for position and momentum operators, formula_51.
Now let formula_52 be any of the eigenstates of formula_26, which are given by formula_54.
Note that these states are normalizable, unlike the eigenstates of the momentum operator on the line.
Note also that the operator formula_25 is bounded, since formula_41 ranges over a bounded interval.
Thus, in the state formula_52, the uncertainty of formula_58 is zero and the uncertainty of formula_59 is finite, so that Although this result appears to violate the Robertson uncertainty principle, the paradox is resolved when we note that formula_52 is not in the domain of the operator formula_62, since multiplication by formula_41 disrupts the periodic boundary conditions imposed on formula_26.
Thus, the derivation of the Robertson relation, which requires formula_65 and formula_66 to be defined, does not apply.
(These also furnish an example of operators satisfying the canonical commutation relations but not the Weyl relations.)
For the usual position and momentum operators formula_67 and formula_68 on the real line, no such counterexamples can occur.
As long as formula_69 and formula_70 are defined in the state formula_52, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle holds, even if formula_52 fails to be in the domain of formula_73 or of formula_74.
Consider a one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO).
Using the standard rules for creation and annihilation operators on the eigenstates of the QHO, the variances may be computed directly, The product of these standard deviations is then
In particular, the above Kennard bound is saturated for the ground state , for which the probability density is just the normal distribution.
In a quantum harmonic oscillator of characteristic angular frequency ω, place a state that is offset from the bottom of the potential by some displacement "x" as where Ω describes the width of the initial state but need not be the same as ω.
Through integration over the , we can solve for the full time -dependent solution.
After many cancelations, the probability densities reduce to where we have used the notation formula_85 to denote a normal distribution of mean μ and variance σ.
Copying the variances above and applying trigonometric identities, we can write the product of the standard deviations as
we can conclude the following: (the right most equality holds only when Ω = "ω") .
A coherent state is a right eigenstate of the annihilation operator, which may be represented in terms of Fock states as
One expects that the factor "Ce" may be replaced by "Ce" , which is only known if either S or Σ is convex.
The mathematician G. H. Hardy formulated the following uncertainty principle: it is not possible for f and ƒ̂ to both be "very rapidly decreasing".
Specifically, if f in formula_91 is such that and
then, if "ab" > 1, "f" = 0 , while if "ab" = 1 , then there is a polynomial P of degree ≤ "N" such that
This was later improved as follows: if formula_96 is such that
then where P is a polynomial of degree ("N" − "d")/2 and A is a real "d"×"d" positive definite matrix.
This result was stated in Beurling's complete works without proof and proved in Hörmander (the case formula_99) and Bonami, Demange, and Jaming for the general case.
Note that Hörmander–Beurling's version implies the case "ab" > 1 in Hardy's Theorem while the version by Bonami–Demange–Jaming covers the full strength of Hardy's Theorem.
A different proof of Beurling's theorem based on Liouville's theorem appeared in ref.
A full description of the case "ab" < 1 as well as the following extension to Schwartz class distributions appears in ref.
If a tempered distribution formula_100 is such that
and then for some convenient polynomial P and real positive definite matrix A of type "d" × "d" .
Werner Heisenberg formulated the uncertainty principle at Niels Bohr's institute in Copenhagen, while working on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics.
In 1925, following pioneering work with Hendrik Kramers, Heisenberg developed matrix mechanics, which replaced the ad hoc old quantum theory with modern quantum mechanics.
The central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level, as electrons in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits.
Rather, their motion is smeared out in a strange way: the Fourier transform of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation.
Heisenberg's paper did not admit any unobservable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the Fourier components of the motion.
Since the Fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies, they could not be used to construct an exact trajectory, so that the formalism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going.
In March 1926, working in Bohr's institute, Heisenberg realized that the non-commutativity implies the uncertainty principle.
This implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non-commutativity, and it laid the foundation for what became known as the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Heisenberg showed that the commutation relation implies an uncertainty, or in Bohr's language a complementarity.
Any two variables that do not commute cannot be measured simultaneously—the more precisely one is known, the less precisely the other can be known.
Heisenberg wrote:It can be expressed in its simplest form as follows: One can never know with perfect accuracy both of those two important factors which determine the movement of one of the smallest particles—its position and its velocity.
It is impossible to determine accurately "both" the position and the direction and speed of a particle "at the same instant".
In his celebrated 1927 paper, "Über den anschaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik" ("On the Perceptual Content of Quantum Theoretical Kinematics and Mechanics"), Heisenberg established this expression as the minimum amount of unavoidable momentum disturbance caused by any position measurement, but he did not give a precise definition for the uncertainties Δx and Δp.
Instead, he gave some plausible estimates in each case separately.
where , and "σ" , "σ" are the standard deviations of position and momentum.
Heisenberg only proved relation (2 ) for the special case of Gaussian states.
Throughout the main body of his original 1927 paper, written in German, Heisenberg used the word, "Ungenauigkeit" ("indeterminacy"), to describe the basic theoretical principle.
Only in the endnote did he switch to the word, "Unsicherheit" ("uncertainty").
When the English-language version of Heisenberg's textbook, "The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory", was published in 1930, however, the translation "uncertainty" was used, and it became the more commonly used term in the English language thereafter.
The principle is quite counter-intuitive, so the early students of quantum theory had to be reassured that naive measurements to violate it were bound always to be unworkable.
One way in which Heisenberg originally illustrated the intrinsic impossibility of violating the uncertainty principle is by utilizing the observer effect of an imaginary microscope as a measuring device.
He imagines an experimenter trying to measure the position and momentum of an electron by shooting a photon at it.
The combination of these trade-offs implies that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used, the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit, which is (up to a small numerical factor) equal to Planck's constant.
Heisenberg did not care to formulate the uncertainty principle as an exact limit (which is elaborated below), and preferred to use it instead, as a heuristic quantitative statement, correct up to small numerical factors, which makes the radically new noncommutativity of quantum mechanics inevitable.
The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle were, in fact, seen as twin targets by detractors who believed in an underlying determinism and realism.
According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, there is no fundamental reality that the quantum state describes, just a prescription for calculating experimental results.
There is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is, only what the result of observations might be.
Albert Einstein believed that randomness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality, while Niels Bohr believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and irreducible, and depend on which measurements we choose to perform.
Einstein and Bohr debated the uncertainty principle for many years.
Bohr's response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well, and that to measure the recoil to accuracy Δ"p" , the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through.
This introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to , and if the wall's momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil, the slit's position is uncertain enough to disallow a position measurement.
A similar analysis with particles diffracting through multiple slits is given by Richard Feynman.
Bohr was present when Einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as Einstein's box.
Einstein argued that "Heisenberg's uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy, the product of the two being related to Planck's constant."
Consider, he said, an ideal box, lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely.
The box could be weighed before a clockwork mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape.
"We now know, explained Einstein, precisely the time at which the photon left the box."
"Now, weigh the box again.
The change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light.
In this manner, said Einstein, one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision, in contradiction to the uncertainty principle."
Bohr spent a sleepless night considering this argument, and eventually realized that it was flawed.
He pointed out that if the box were to be weighed, say by a spring and a pointer on a scale, "since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight, there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table.
... Furthermore, the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth's surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock," because of Einstein's own theory of gravity's effect on time.
"Through this chain of uncertainties, Bohr showed that Einstein's light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape."
Bohr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by Einstein.
In 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (see EPR paradox) published an analysis of widely separated entangled particles.
Measuring one particle, Einstein realized, would alter the probability distribution of the other, yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed.
This example led Bohr to revise his understanding of the principle, concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction.
But Einstein came to much more far-reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment.
He believed the "natural basic assumption" that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from "locally changing deterministic quantities" and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle.
In 1964, John Bell showed that this assumption can be falsified, since it would imply a certain inequality between the probabilities of different experiments.
Experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics, ruling out Einstein's basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his "hidden variables".
These hidden variables may be "hidden" because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small.
This illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed.
This same illusion manifests itself in the observation of subatomic particles.
Both the fan blades and the subatomic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer.
Therefore, it is possible that there would be predictability of the subatomic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking...Ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting Karl Popper's philosophy of invalidation of a theory by falsification-experiments.
That is to say, here Einstein's "basic assumption" became falsified by experiments based on Bell's inequalities.
For the objections of Karl Popper to the Heisenberg inequality itself, see below.
While it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact David Bohm invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists.
The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable.
If the hidden variables are not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes.
To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption—that the size of the observable universe puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do.
A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a quantum computer would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially achievable task in quantum mechanics.
Karl Popper approached the problem of indeterminacy as a logician and metaphysical realist.
He disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to ensembles of identically prepared particles, referring to them as "statistical scatter relations".
In this statistical interpretation, a "particular" measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalidating the quantum theory.
This directly contrasts with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which is non-deterministic but lacks local hidden variables.
In 1934, Popper published "Zur Kritik der Ungenauigkeitsrelationen" ("Critique of the Uncertainty Relations") in "Naturwissenschaften", and in the same year "Logik der Forschung" (translated and updated by the author as "The Logic of Scientific Discovery" in 1959), outlining his arguments for the statistical interpretation.
In 1982, he further developed his theory in "Quantum theory and the schism in Physics", writing: Heisenberg's formulae are, beyond all doubt, derivable "statistical formulae" of the quantum theory.
But they have been "habitually misinterpreted" by those quantum theorists who said that these formulae can be interpreted as determining some upper limit to the "precision of our measurements".
Popper proposed an experiment to falsify the uncertainty relations, although he later withdrew his initial version after discussions with Weizsäcker, Heisenberg, and Einstein; this experiment may have influenced the formulation of the EPR experiment.
The many-worlds interpretation originally outlined by Hugh Everett III in 1957 is partly meant to reconcile the differences between Einstein's and Bohr's views by replacing Bohr's wave function collapse with an ensemble of deterministic and independent universes whose "distribution" is governed by wave functions and the Schrödinger equation.
Thus, uncertainty in the many-worlds interpretation follows from each observer within any universe having no knowledge of what goes on in the other universes.
Some scientists including Arthur Compton and Martin Heisenberg have suggested that the uncertainty principle, or at least the general probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, could be evidence for the two-stage model of free will.
One critique, however, is that apart from the basic role of quantum mechanics as a foundation for chemistry, nontrivial biological mechanisms requiring quantum mechanics are unlikely, due to the rapid decoherence time of quantum systems at room temperature.
The standard view, however, is that this decoherence is overcome by both screening and decoherence-free subspaces found in biological cells.
There is reason to believe that violating the uncertainty principle also strongly implies the violation of the second law of thermodynamics.
