[CLS] in quantum mechanics , the uncertainty principle ( also known as he ##isen ##berg ' s uncertainty principle ) is any of a variety of mathematical in ##e ##qual ##ities asserting a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle , known as complementary variables or canonical ##ly con ##ju ##gate variables such as position " x " and momentum " p " , can be known or , depending on interpretation , to what extent such con ##ju ##gate properties maintain their approximate meaning , as the mathematical framework of quantum physics does not support the notion of simultaneously well - defined con ##ju ##gate properties expressed by a single value . [SEP]
[CLS] introduced first in 1927 , by the german physicist werner he ##isen ##berg , it states that the more precisely the position of some particle is determined , the less precisely its momentum can be known , and vice versa . [SEP]
[CLS] the formal inequality relating the standard deviation of position " σ " and the standard deviation of momentum " σ " was derived by earle hesse ken ##nard later that year and by hermann we ##yl in 1928 : where ħ is the reduced planck constant , " h " / ( 2 ##π ) . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , the uncertainty principle has been confused with a related effect in physics , called the observer effect , which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems , that is , without changing something in a system . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##isen ##berg utilized such an observer effect at the quantum level ( see below ) as a physical " explanation " of quantum uncertainty . [SEP]
[CLS] it has since become clearer , however , that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all wave - like systems , and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , " the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems and is not a statement about the observation ##al success of current technology " . [SEP]
[CLS] it must be emphasized that " measurement " does not mean only a process in which a physicist - observer takes part , but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer . [SEP]
[CLS] since the uncertainty principle is such a basic result in quantum mechanics , typical experiments in quantum mechanics routinely observe aspects of it . [SEP]
[CLS] certain experiments , however , may deliberately test a particular form of the uncertainty principle as part of their main research program . [SEP]
[CLS] these include , for example , tests of number – phase uncertainty relations in super ##con ##du ##cting or quantum optics systems . [SEP]
[CLS] applications dependent on the uncertainty principle for their operation include extremely low - noise technology such as that required in gravitational wave inter ##fer ##ometer ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the uncertainty principle is not readily apparent on the macro ##scopic scales of everyday experience . [SEP]
[CLS] so it is helpful to demonstrate how it applies to more easily understood physical situations . [SEP]
[CLS] two alternative framework ##s for quantum physics offer different explanations for the uncertainty principle . [SEP]
[CLS] the wave mechanics picture of the uncertainty principle is more visually intuitive , but the more abstract matrix mechanics picture formula ##tes it in a way that general ##izes more easily . [SEP]
[CLS] mathematical ##ly , in wave mechanics , the uncertainty relation between position and momentum arises because the expressions of the wave ##fu ##nction in the two corresponding or ##th ##ono ##rma ##l bases in hilbert space are fourier transforms of one another ( i . e . , position and momentum are con ##ju ##gate variables ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a non ##zer ##o function and its fourier transform cannot both be sharply localized . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar trade ##off between the variance ##s of fourier con ##ju ##gate ##s arises in all systems under ##lain by fourier analysis , for example in sound waves : a pure tone is a sharp spike at a single frequency , while its fourier transform gives the shape of the sound wave in the time domain , which is a completely del ##oca ##lized sin ##e wave . [SEP]
[CLS] in quantum mechanics , the two key points are that the position of the particle takes the form of a matter wave , and momentum is its fourier con ##ju ##gate , assured by the de bro ##gli ##e relation , where k is the wave ##num ##ber . [SEP]
[CLS] in matrix mechanics , the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics , any pair of non - com ##mut ##ing self - ad ##jo ##int operators representing ob ##ser ##vable ##s are subject to similar uncertainty limits . [SEP]
[CLS] an e ##igen ##sta ##te of an ob ##ser ##vable represents the state of the wave ##fu ##nction for a certain measurement value ( the e ##igen ##val ##ue ) . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , if a measurement of an ob ##ser ##vable a is performed , then the system is in a particular e ##igen ##sta ##te ψ of that ob ##ser ##vable . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the particular e ##igen ##sta ##te of the ob ##ser ##vable a need not be an e ##igen ##sta ##te of another ob ##ser ##vable b : if so , then it does not have a unique associated measurement for it , as the system is not in an e ##igen ##sta ##te of that ob ##ser ##vable . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the de bro ##gli ##e hypothesis , every object in the universe is a wave , i . e . , a situation which gives rise to this phenomenon . [SEP]
[CLS] the position of the particle is described by a wave function formula _ 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] the time - independent wave function of a single - mode ##d plane wave of wave ##num ##ber " k " or momentum " p " is [SEP]
[CLS] the born rule states that this should be interpreted as a probability density amplitude function in the sense that the probability of finding the particle between " a " and " b " is [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of the single - mode ##d plane wave , formula _ 4 is a uniform distribution . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , the particle position is extremely uncertain in the sense that it could be essentially anywhere along the wave packet . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , consider a wave function that is a sum of many waves , which we may write this as [SEP]
[CLS] where " a " represents the relative contribution of the mode " p " to the overall total . [SEP]
[CLS] the figures to the right show how with the addition of many plane waves , the wave packet can become more localized . [SEP]
[CLS] we may take this a step further to the continuum limit , where the wave function is an integral over all possible modes [SEP]
[CLS] with formula _ 7 representing the amplitude of these modes and is called the wave function in momentum space . [SEP]
[CLS] in mathematical terms , we say that formula _ 7 is the " fourier transform " of formula _ 9 and that " x " and " p " are con ##ju ##gate variables . [SEP]
[CLS] adding together all of these plane waves comes at a cost , namely the momentum has become less precise , having become a mixture of waves of many different moment ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] one way to quan ##tify the precision of the position and momentum is the standard deviation " σ " . [SEP]
[CLS] since formula _ 4 is a probability density function for position , we calculate its standard deviation . [SEP]
[CLS] the precision of the position is improved , i . e . reduced σ , by using many plane waves , thereby weakening the precision of the momentum , i . e . increased σ . [SEP]
[CLS] another way of stating this is that σ and σ have an inverse relationship or are at least bounded from below . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the uncertainty principle , the exact limit of which is the ken ##nard bound . [SEP]
[CLS] click the " show " button below to see a semi - formal derivation of the ken ##nard inequality using wave mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] in matrix mechanics , ob ##ser ##vable ##s such as position and momentum are represented by self - ad ##jo ##int operators . [SEP]
[CLS] when considering pairs of ob ##ser ##vable ##s , an important quantity is the " com ##mut ##ator " . [SEP]
[CLS] for a pair of operators a and b , one defines their com ##mut ##ator as in the case of position and momentum , the com ##mut ##ator is the canonical com ##mut ##ation relation [SEP]
[CLS] the physical meaning of the non - com ##mut ##ati ##vity can be understood by considering the effect of the com ##mut ##ator on position and momentum e ##igen ##sta ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] let formula _ 13 be a right e ##igen ##sta ##te of position with a constant e ##igen ##val ##ue " x " . [SEP]
[CLS] by definition , this means that formula _ 14 applying the com ##mut ##ator to formula _ 13 yields where i is the identity operator . [SEP]
[CLS] suppose , for the sake of proof by contradiction , that formula _ 13 is also a right e ##igen ##sta ##te of momentum , with constant e ##igen ##val ##ue " p " . [SEP]
[CLS] if this were true , then one could write on the other hand , the above canonical com ##mut ##ation relation requires that this implies that no quantum state can simultaneously be both a position and a momentum e ##igen ##sta ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] when a state is measured , it is projected onto an e ##igen ##sta ##te in the basis of the relevant ob ##ser ##vable . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , if a particle ' s position is measured , then the state amounts to a position e ##igen ##sta ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] this means that the state is " not " a momentum e ##igen ##sta ##te , however , but rather it can be represented as a sum of multiple momentum basis e ##igen ##sta ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , the momentum must be less precise . [SEP]
[CLS] this precision may be quan ##ti ##fied by the standard deviation ##s , [SEP]
[CLS] as in the wave mechanics interpretation above , one sees a trade ##off between the respective precision ##s of the two , quan ##ti ##fied by the uncertainty principle . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common general form of the uncertainty principle is the " robertson uncertainty relation " . [SEP]
[CLS] for an arbitrary hermit ##ian operator formula _ 22 we can associate a standard deviation [SEP]
[CLS] where the brackets formula _ 24 indicate an expectation value . [SEP]
[CLS] for a pair of operators formula _ 25 and formula _ 26 , we may define their " com ##mut ##ator " as [SEP]
[CLS] in this notation , the robertson uncertainty relation is given by [SEP]
[CLS] the robertson uncertainty relation immediately follows from a slightly stronger inequality , the " sc ##hr ##od ##inger uncertainty relation " , where we have introduced the " anti ##com ##mut ##ator " , [SEP]
[CLS] since the robertson and sc ##hr ##od ##inger relations are for general operators , the relations can be applied to any two ob ##ser ##vable ##s to obtain specific uncertainty relations . [SEP]
[CLS] a few of the most common relations found in the literature are given below . [SEP]
[CLS] suppose we consider a quantum particle on a ring , where the wave function depends on an angular variable formula _ 41 , which we may take to lie in the interval formula _ 42 . [SEP]
[CLS] define " position " and " momentum " operators formula _ 25 and formula _ 26 by [SEP]
[CLS] where we impose periodic boundary conditions on formula _ 26 . [SEP]
[CLS] note that the definition of formula _ 25 depends on our choice to have formula _ 41 range from 0 to formula _ 50 . [SEP]
[CLS] these operators satisfy the usual com ##mut ##ation relations for position and momentum operators , formula _ 51 . [SEP]
[CLS] now let formula _ 52 be any of the e ##igen ##sta ##tes of formula _ 26 , which are given by formula _ 54 . [SEP]
[CLS] note that these states are normal ##iza ##ble , unlike the e ##igen ##sta ##tes of the momentum operator on the line . [SEP]
[CLS] note also that the operator formula _ 25 is bounded , since formula _ 41 ranges over a bounded interval . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , in the state formula _ 52 , the uncertainty of formula _ 58 is zero and the uncertainty of formula _ 59 is finite , so that although this result appears to violate the robertson uncertainty principle , the paradox is resolved when we note that formula _ 52 is not in the domain of the operator formula _ 62 , since multiplication by formula _ 41 disrupt ##s the periodic boundary conditions imposed on formula _ 26 . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the derivation of the robertson relation , which requires formula _ 65 and formula _ 66 to be defined , does not apply . [SEP]
[CLS] ( these also fur ##nish an example of operators satisfying the canonical com ##mut ##ation relations but not the we ##yl relations . ) [SEP]
[CLS] for the usual position and momentum operators formula _ 67 and formula _ 68 on the real line , no such counter ##ex ##amp ##les can occur . [SEP]
[CLS] as long as formula _ 69 and formula _ 70 are defined in the state formula _ 52 , the he ##isen ##berg uncertainty principle holds , even if formula _ 52 fails to be in the domain of formula _ 73 or of formula _ 74 . [SEP]
[CLS] consider a one - dimensional quantum harmonic os ##ci ##lla ##tor ( q ##ho ) . [SEP]
[CLS] using the standard rules for creation and ann ##ih ##ilation operators on the e ##igen ##sta ##tes of the q ##ho , the variance ##s may be computed directly , the product of these standard deviation ##s is then [SEP]
[CLS] in particular , the above ken ##nard bound is saturated for the ground state , for which the probability density is just the normal distribution . [SEP]
[CLS] in a quantum harmonic os ##ci ##lla ##tor of characteristic angular frequency ω , place a state that is offset from the bottom of the potential by some displacement " x " as where ω describes the width of the initial state but need not be the same as ω . [SEP]
[CLS] through integration over the , we can solve for the full time - dependent solution . [SEP]
[CLS] after many cancel ##ations , the probability den ##sities reduce to where we have used the notation formula _ 85 to denote a normal distribution of mean μ and variance σ . [SEP]
[CLS] copying the variance ##s above and applying tri ##gon ##ometric identities , we can write the product of the standard deviation ##s as [SEP]
[CLS] we can conclude the following : ( the right most equality holds only when ω = " ω " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a coherent state is a right e ##igen ##sta ##te of the ann ##ih ##ilation operator , which may be represented in terms of f ##ock states as [SEP]
[CLS] one expects that the factor " ce " may be replaced by " ce " , which is only known if either s or σ is convex . [SEP]
[CLS] the mathematician g . h . hardy formulated the following uncertainty principle : it is not possible for f and ƒ to both be " very rapidly decreasing " . [SEP]
[CLS] specifically , if f in formula _ 91 is such that and [SEP]
[CLS] then , if " ab " > 1 , " f " = 0 , while if " ab " = 1 , then there is a polynomial p of degree ≤ " n " such that [SEP]
[CLS] this was later improved as follows : if formula _ 96 is such that [SEP]
[CLS] then where p is a polynomial of degree ( " n " − " d " ) / 2 and a is a real " d " × " d " positive definite matrix . [SEP]
[CLS] this result was stated in be ##ur ##ling ' s complete works without proof and proved in ho ##rman ##der ( the case formula _ 99 ) and bon ##ami , dem ##ange , and jam ##ing for the general case . [SEP]
[CLS] note that ho ##rman ##der – be ##ur ##ling ' s version implies the case " ab " > 1 in hardy ' s theorem while the version by bon ##ami – dem ##ange – jam ##ing covers the full strength of hardy ' s theorem . [SEP]
[CLS] a different proof of be ##ur ##ling ' s theorem based on li ##ou ##ville ' s theorem appeared in ref . [SEP]
[CLS] a full description of the case " ab " < 1 as well as the following extension to schwartz class distributions appears in ref . [SEP]
[CLS] if a tempered distribution formula _ 100 is such that [SEP]
[CLS] and then for some convenient polynomial p and real positive definite matrix a of type " d " × " d " . [SEP]
[CLS] werner he ##isen ##berg formulated the uncertainty principle at ni ##els bo ##hr ' s institute in copenhagen , while working on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1925 , following pioneering work with hen ##drik kramer ##s , he ##isen ##berg developed matrix mechanics , which replaced the ad hoc old quantum theory with modern quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] the central premise was that the classical concept of motion does not fit at the quantum level , as electrons in an atom do not travel on sharply defined orbits . [SEP]
[CLS] rather , their motion is smeared out in a strange way : the fourier transform of its time dependence only involves those frequencies that could be observed in the quantum jumps of their radiation . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##isen ##berg ' s paper did not admit any uno ##bs ##er ##vable quantities like the exact position of the electron in an orbit at any time ; he only allowed the theorist to talk about the fourier components of the motion . [SEP]
[CLS] since the fourier components were not defined at the classical frequencies , they could not be used to construct an exact trajectory , so that the formal ##ism could not answer certain overly precise questions about where the electron was or how fast it was going . [SEP]
[CLS] in march 1926 , working in bo ##hr ' s institute , he ##isen ##berg realized that the non - com ##mut ##ati ##vity implies the uncertainty principle . [SEP]
[CLS] this implication provided a clear physical interpretation for the non - com ##mut ##ati ##vity , and it laid the foundation for what became known as the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##isen ##berg showed that the com ##mut ##ation relation implies an uncertainty , or in bo ##hr ' s language a complement ##ari ##ty . [SEP]
[CLS] any two variables that do not com ##mute cannot be measured simultaneously — the more precisely one is known , the less precisely the other can be known . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##isen ##berg wrote : it can be expressed in its simplest form as follows : one can never know with perfect accuracy both of those two important factors which determine the movement of one of the smallest particles — its position and its velocity . [SEP]
[CLS] it is impossible to determine accurately " both " the position and the direction and speed of a particle " at the same instant " . [SEP]
[CLS] in his celebrated 1927 paper , " uber den an ##sch ##au ##liche ##n in ##hal ##t der quan ##ten ##the ##ore ##tis ##chen kin ##ema ##ti ##k und me ##chan ##ik " ( " on the per ##ce ##pt ##ual content of quantum theoretical kin ##ema ##tics and mechanics " ) , he ##isen ##berg established this expression as the minimum amount of una ##vo ##ida ##ble momentum disturbance caused by any position measurement , but he did not give a precise definition for the uncertain ##ties δ ##x and δ ##p . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , he gave some plausible estimates in each case separately . [SEP]
[CLS] where , and " σ " , " σ " are the standard deviation ##s of position and momentum . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##isen ##berg only proved relation ( 2 ) for the special case of ga ##uss ##ian states . [SEP]
[CLS] throughout the main body of his original 1927 paper , written in german , he ##isen ##berg used the word , " un ##gen ##au ##ig ##kei ##t " ( " ind ##eter ##mina ##cy " ) , to describe the basic theoretical principle . [SEP]
[CLS] only in the end ##note did he switch to the word , " un ##sic ##her ##hei ##t " ( " uncertainty " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when the english - language version of he ##isen ##berg ' s textbook , " the physical principles of the quantum theory " , was published in 1930 , however , the translation " uncertainty " was used , and it became the more commonly used term in the english language thereafter . [SEP]
[CLS] the principle is quite counter - intuitive , so the early students of quantum theory had to be reassured that naive measurements to violate it were bound always to be un ##work ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] one way in which he ##isen ##berg originally illustrated the intrinsic imp ##oss ##ibility of violating the uncertainty principle is by utilizing the observer effect of an imaginary microscope as a measuring device . [SEP]
[CLS] he imagine ##s an experiment ##er trying to measure the position and momentum of an electron by shooting a photon at it . [SEP]
[CLS] the combination of these trade - offs implies that no matter what photon wavelength and aperture size are used , the product of the uncertainty in measured position and measured momentum is greater than or equal to a lower limit , which is ( up to a small numerical factor ) equal to planck ' s constant . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##isen ##berg did not care to formula ##te the uncertainty principle as an exact limit ( which is elaborated below ) , and preferred to use it instead , as a he ##uri ##stic quantitative statement , correct up to small numerical factors , which makes the radically new non ##com ##mut ##ati ##vity of quantum mechanics inevitable . [SEP]
[CLS] the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and he ##isen ##berg ' s uncertainty principle were , in fact , seen as twin targets by det ##rac ##tors who believed in an underlying deter ##mini ##sm and realism . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics , there is no fundamental reality that the quantum state describes , just a prescription for calculating experimental results . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no way to say what the state of a system fundamentally is , only what the result of observations might be . [SEP]
[CLS] albert einstein believed that random ##ness is a reflection of our ignorance of some fundamental property of reality , while ni ##els bo ##hr believed that the probability distributions are fundamental and ir ##red ##ucible , and depend on which measurements we choose to perform . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein and bo ##hr debated the uncertainty principle for many years . [SEP]
[CLS] bo ##hr ' s response was that the wall is quantum mechanical as well , and that to measure the recoil to accuracy δ " p " , the momentum of the wall must be known to this accuracy before the particle passes through . [SEP]
[CLS] this introduces an uncertainty in the position of the wall and therefore the position of the slit equal to , and if the wall ' s momentum is known precisely enough to measure the recoil , the slit ' s position is uncertain enough to di ##sal ##low a position measurement . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar analysis with particles di ##ff ##rac ##ting through multiple slits is given by richard fey ##n ##man . [SEP]
[CLS] bo ##hr was present when einstein proposed the thought experiment which has become known as einstein ' s box . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein argued that " he ##isen ##berg ' s uncertainty equation implied that the uncertainty in time was related to the uncertainty in energy , the product of the two being related to planck ' s constant . " [SEP]
[CLS] consider , he said , an ideal box , lined with mirrors so that it can contain light indefinitely . [SEP]
[CLS] the box could be weighed before a clock ##work mechanism opened an ideal shutter at a chosen instant to allow one single photon to escape . [SEP]
[CLS] " we now know , explained einstein , precisely the time at which the photon left the box . " [SEP]
[CLS] " now , weigh the box again . [SEP]
[CLS] the change of mass tells the energy of the emitted light . [SEP]
[CLS] in this manner , said einstein , one could measure the energy emitted and the time it was released with any desired precision , in contradiction to the uncertainty principle . " [SEP]
[CLS] bo ##hr spent a sleep ##less night considering this argument , and eventually realized that it was flawed . [SEP]
[CLS] he pointed out that if the box were to be weighed , say by a spring and a pointer on a scale , " since the box must move vertically with a change in its weight , there will be uncertainty in its vertical velocity and therefore an uncertainty in its height above the table . [SEP]
[CLS] . . . furthermore , the uncertainty about the elevation above the earth ' s surface will result in an uncertainty in the rate of the clock , " because of einstein ' s own theory of gravity ' s effect on time . [SEP]
[CLS] " through this chain of uncertain ##ties , bo ##hr showed that einstein ' s light box experiment could not simultaneously measure exactly both the energy of the photon and the time of its escape . " [SEP]
[CLS] bo ##hr was compelled to modify his understanding of the uncertainty principle after another thought experiment by einstein . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1935 , einstein , pod ##ols ##ky and rosen ( see ep ##r paradox ) published an analysis of widely separated en ##tangled particles . [SEP]
[CLS] measuring one particle , einstein realized , would alter the probability distribution of the other , yet here the other particle could not possibly be disturbed . [SEP]
[CLS] this example led bo ##hr to rev ##ise his understanding of the principle , concluding that the uncertainty was not caused by a direct interaction . [SEP]
[CLS] but einstein came to much more far - reaching conclusions from the same thought experiment . [SEP]
[CLS] he believed the " natural basic assumption " that a complete description of reality would have to predict the results of experiments from " locally changing deter ##mini ##stic quantities " and therefore would have to include more information than the maximum possible allowed by the uncertainty principle . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1964 , john bell showed that this assumption can be fa ##ls ##ified , since it would imply a certain inequality between the pro ##ba ##bilities of different experiments . [SEP]
[CLS] experimental results confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics , ruling out einstein ' s basic assumption that led him to the suggestion of his " hidden variables " . [SEP]
[CLS] these hidden variables may be " hidden " because of an illusion that occurs during observations of objects that are too large or too small . [SEP]
[CLS] this illusion can be likened to rotating fan blades that seem to pop in and out of existence at different locations and sometimes seem to be in the same place at the same time when observed . [SEP]
[CLS] this same illusion manifest ##s itself in the observation of sub ##ato ##mic particles . [SEP]
[CLS] both the fan blades and the sub ##ato ##mic particles are moving so fast that the illusion is seen by the observer . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , it is possible that there would be predict ##ability of the sub ##ato ##mic particles behavior and characteristics to a recording device capable of very high speed tracking . . . ironically this fact is one of the best pieces of evidence supporting karl pop ##per ' s philosophy of invalid ##ation of a theory by fa ##ls ##ification - experiments . [SEP]
[CLS] that is to say , here einstein ' s " basic assumption " became fa ##ls ##ified by experiments based on bell ' s in ##e ##qual ##ities . [SEP]
[CLS] for the objections of karl pop ##per to the he ##isen ##berg inequality itself , see below . [SEP]
[CLS] while it is possible to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to non ##lo ##cal , hidden variables , and in fact david bo ##hm invented such a formulation , this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicist ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the question of whether a random outcome is pre ##de ##ter ##mined by a non ##lo ##cal theory can be philosophical , and it can be potentially intra ##ctable . [SEP]
[CLS] if the hidden variables are not constrained , they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes . [SEP]
[CLS] to make it sensible , the assumption of non ##lo ##cal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption — that the size of the ob ##ser ##vable universe puts a limit on the computation ##s that these variables can do . [SEP]
[CLS] a non ##lo ##cal theory of this sort predict ##s that a quantum computer would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10 , 000 digits or more ; a potentially ac ##hi ##eva ##ble task in quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] karl pop ##per approached the problem of ind ##eter ##mina ##cy as a logic ##ian and metaphysical real ##ist . [SEP]
[CLS] he disagreed with the application of the uncertainty relations to individual particles rather than to ensembles of identical ##ly prepared particles , referring to them as " statistical sc ##atter relations " . [SEP]
[CLS] in this statistical interpretation , a " particular " measurement may be made to arbitrary precision without invalid ##ating the quantum theory . [SEP]
[CLS] this directly contrasts with the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics , which is non - deter ##mini ##stic but lacks local hidden variables . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1934 , pop ##per published " zur k ##rit ##ik der un ##gen ##au ##ig ##kei ##ts ##rel ##ation ##en " ( " critique of the uncertainty relations " ) in " nat ##ur ##wi ##ssen ##schaft ##en " , and in the same year " log ##ik der for ##sch ##ung " ( translated and updated by the author as " the logic of scientific discovery " in 1959 ) , out ##lining his arguments for the statistical interpretation . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1982 , he further developed his theory in " quantum theory and the sc ##hism in physics " , writing : he ##isen ##berg ' s formula ##e are , beyond all doubt , der ##iva ##ble " statistical formula ##e " of the quantum theory . [SEP]
[CLS] but they have been " habit ##ually mis ##int ##er ##pre ##ted " by those quantum theorists who said that these formula ##e can be interpreted as determining some upper limit to the " precision of our measurements " . [SEP]
[CLS] pop ##per proposed an experiment to fa ##ls ##ify the uncertainty relations , although he later withdrew his initial version after discussions with wei ##z ##sack ##er , he ##isen ##berg , and einstein ; this experiment may have influenced the formulation of the ep ##r experiment . [SEP]
[CLS] the many - worlds interpretation originally outlined by hugh everett iii in 1957 is partly meant to reconcile the differences between einstein ' s and bo ##hr ' s views by replacing bo ##hr ' s wave function collapse with an ensemble of deter ##mini ##stic and independent universe ##s whose " distribution " is governed by wave functions and the sc ##hr ##od ##inger equation . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , uncertainty in the many - worlds interpretation follows from each observer within any universe having no knowledge of what goes on in the other universe ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] some scientists including arthur compton and martin he ##isen ##berg have suggested that the uncertainty principle , or at least the general pro ##ba ##bilis ##tic nature of quantum mechanics , could be evidence for the two - stage model of free will . [SEP]
[CLS] one critique , however , is that apart from the basic role of quantum mechanics as a foundation for chemistry , non ##tri ##vial biological mechanisms requiring quantum mechanics are unlikely , due to the rapid deco ##her ##ence time of quantum systems at room temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] the standard view , however , is that this deco ##her ##ence is overcome by both screening and deco ##her ##ence - free subsp ##ace ##s found in biological cells . [SEP]
[CLS] there is reason to believe that violating the uncertainty principle also strongly implies the violation of the second law of the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mics . [SEP]
