[CLS] a country may be an independent sovereign state or part of a larger state , as a non - sovereign or formerly sovereign political division , or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics . [SEP]
[CLS] regardless of the physical geography , in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the league of nations in 1937 and re ##af ##firmed by the united nations in 1945 , a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction . [SEP]
[CLS] " countries " can refer both to sovereign states and to other political entities , while other times it can refer only to states . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the " cia world fact ##book " uses the word in its " country name " field to refer to " a wide variety of depend ##encies , areas of special sovereignty , uninhabited islands , and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states " . [SEP]
[CLS] in english the word has increasingly become associated with political divisions , so that one sense , associated with the indefinite article – " a country " – through mis ##use and subsequent con ##fl ##ation is now a synonym for state , or a former sovereign state , in the sense of sovereign territory or " district , native land " . [SEP]
[CLS] areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the west country in england , the black country ( a heavily industrial ##ized part of england ) , " constable country " ( a part of east anglia painted by john constable ) , the " big country " ( used in various contexts of the american west ) , " coal country " ( used of parts of the us and elsewhere ) and many other terms . [SEP]
[CLS] the equivalent terms in french and other romance languages ( " pays " and variants ) have not carried the process of being identified with political sovereign states as far as the english " country " , instead derived from , pa ##gus , which designated the territory controlled by a medieval count , a title originally granted by the roman church . [SEP]
[CLS] in many european countries the words are used for sub - divisions of the national territory , as in the german bun ##des ##lander , as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state . [SEP]
[CLS] a version of " country " can be found in the modern french language as " con ##tree " , based on the word " cu ##nt ##ree " in old french , that is used similarly to the word " pays " to define non - state regions , but can also be used to describe a political state in some particular cases . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no universal agreement on the number of " countries " in the world since a number of states have disputed sovereignty status . [SEP]
[CLS] some are possessions of sovereign states , as several states have overseas territories ( such as french poly ##nesia or the british virgin islands ) , with citizen ##ry at times identical and at times distinct from their own . [SEP]
[CLS] such territories , with the exception of distinct dependent territories , are usually listed together with sovereign states on lists of countries , but may nonetheless be treated as a separate " country of origin " in international trade , as hong kong is . [SEP]
