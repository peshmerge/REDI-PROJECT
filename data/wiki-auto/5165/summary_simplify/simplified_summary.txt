a country may be an independent sovereign state or part of a larger state .
in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the league of nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the united nations in 1945 , a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction .
countries can refer both to sovereign states and to other political groups .
for example , the " cia world factbook " uses the word in its " country name " field to refer to " a wide variety of dependencies , areas of special sovereignty , uninhabited islands , and other entities in addition to the traditional countries or independent states . "
in english the word has become associated with political divisions .
areas much smaller than a political state may be called by names such as the west country in england , the black country is heavily industrialized part of england .
the equivalent terms in french and other romance languages indicate that the government is not the same as the political sovereign states as the english " country " .
in many european countries the word is used for sub-divisions of the national territory , as in the german bundeslander , as well as a less formal term for a sovereign state .
a version of " country " can be found in the modern french language as " contree " , based on the word " cuntree " in old french .
no one is certain , but no one has agreed on the number of countries in the world .
some are territories of sovereign states .
such territories , with the exception of distinct dependent territories , are usually listed together with sovereign states on lists of countries .
