[CLS] in geometry , an oct ##ah ##ed ##ron ( plural : oct ##ah ##ed ##ra ) is a poly ##hedron with eight faces , twelve edges , and six vertices . [SEP]
[CLS] the term is most commonly used to refer to the regular oct ##ah ##ed ##ron , a plato ##nic solid composed of eight e ##quil ##ater ##al triangles , four of which meet at each vertex . [SEP]
[CLS] a regular oct ##ah ##ed ##ron is the dual poly ##hedron of a cube . [SEP]

[CLS] thus the volume is four times that of a regular te ##tra ##hedron with the same edge length , while the surface area is twice ( because we have 8 rather than 4 triangles ) . [SEP]

[CLS] the vertices of the oct ##ah ##ed ##ron lie at the mid ##points of the edges of the te ##tra ##hedron , and in this sense it relates to the te ##tra ##hedron in the same way that the cub ##oc ##ta ##hedron and ic ##osi ##do ##de ##ca ##hedron relate to the other plato ##nic solids . [SEP]
[CLS] one can also divide the edges of an oct ##ah ##ed ##ron in the ratio of the golden mean to define the vertices of an ic ##osa ##hedron . [SEP]
