[CLS] in geometry , an oct ##ah ##ed ##ron ( plural : oct ##ah ##ed ##ra ) is a poly ##hedron with eight faces , twelve edges , and six vertices . [SEP]
[CLS] the term is most commonly used to refer to the regular oct ##ah ##ed ##ron , a plato ##nic solid composed of eight e ##quil ##ater ##al triangles , four of which meet at each vertex . [SEP]
[CLS] a regular oct ##ah ##ed ##ron is the dual poly ##hedron of a cube . [SEP]
[CLS] an oct ##ah ##ed ##ron is the three - dimensional case of the more general concept of a cross poly ##top ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] if the edge length of a regular oct ##ah ##ed ##ron is " a " , the radius of a ci ##rc ##ums ##cr ##ibe ##d sphere ( one that touches the oct ##ah ##ed ##ron at all vertices ) is [SEP]
[CLS] and the radius of an inscribed sphere ( tangent to each of the oct ##ah ##ed ##ron ' s faces ) is [SEP]
[CLS] while the mid ##rad ##ius , which touches the middle of each edge , is [SEP]
[CLS] the " oct ##ah ##ed ##ron " has four special orthogonal projections , centered , on an edge , vertex , face , and normal to a face . [SEP]
[CLS] the second and third correspond to the b and a cox ##eter planes . [SEP]
[CLS] the oct ##ah ##ed ##ron can also be represented as a spherical til ##ing , and projected onto the plane via a stereo ##graphic projection . [SEP]
[CLS] straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane . [SEP]
[CLS] an oct ##ah ##ed ##ron with edge length can be placed with its center at the origin and its vertices on the coordinate axes ; the cart ##esian coordinates of the vertices are then [SEP]
[CLS] in an " x " – " y " – " z " cart ##esian coordinate system , the oct ##ah ##ed ##ron with center coordinates ( " a " , " b " , " c " ) and radius " r " is the set of all points ( " x " , " y " , " z " ) such that [SEP]
[CLS] thus the volume is four times that of a regular te ##tra ##hedron with the same edge length , while the surface area is twice ( because we have 8 rather than 4 triangles ) . [SEP]
[CLS] if an oct ##ah ##ed ##ron has been stretched so that it obey ##s the equation [SEP]
[CLS] the formulas for the surface area and volume expand to become [SEP]
[CLS] additionally the in ##ert ##ia tensor of the stretched oct ##ah ##ed ##ron is [SEP]
[CLS] these reduce to the equations for the regular oct ##ah ##ed ##ron when [SEP]
[CLS] the interior of the compound of two dual te ##tra ##hed ##ra is an oct ##ah ##ed ##ron , and this compound , called the stella oct ##ang ##ula , is its first and only stella ##tion . [SEP]
[CLS] the vertices of the oct ##ah ##ed ##ron lie at the mid ##points of the edges of the te ##tra ##hedron , and in this sense it relates to the te ##tra ##hedron in the same way that the cub ##oc ##ta ##hedron and ic ##osi ##do ##de ##ca ##hedron relate to the other plato ##nic solids . [SEP]
[CLS] one can also divide the edges of an oct ##ah ##ed ##ron in the ratio of the golden mean to define the vertices of an ic ##osa ##hedron . [SEP]
[CLS] this is done by first placing vectors along the oct ##ah ##ed ##ron ' s edges such that each face is bounded by a cycle , then similarly partition ##ing each edge into the golden mean along the direction of its vector . [SEP]
[CLS] there are five oct ##ah ##ed ##ra that define any given ic ##osa ##hedron in this fashion , and together they define a " regular compound " . [SEP]
[CLS] oct ##ah ##ed ##ra and te ##tra ##hed ##ra can be alternate ##d to form a vertex , edge , and face - uniform tess ##ella ##tion of space , called the oct ##et truss by buck ##minster fuller . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the only such til ##ing save the regular tess ##ella ##tion of cube ##s , and is one of the 28 convex uniform honey ##comb ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] another is a tess ##ella ##tion of oct ##ah ##ed ##ra and cub ##oc ##ta ##hed ##ra . [SEP]
[CLS] consequently , it is the only member of that group to possess mirror planes that do not pass through any of the faces . [SEP]
[CLS] the oct ##ah ##ed ##ron is 4 - connected , meaning that it takes the removal of four vertices to disco ##nne ##ct the remaining vertices . [SEP]
[CLS] the other three poly ##hed ##ra with this property are the pentagon ##al dip ##yra ##mi ##d , the s ##nu ##b di ##sp ##hen ##oid , and an irregular poly ##hedron with 12 vertices and 20 triangular faces . [SEP]
[CLS] they all have six vertices , eight triangular faces , and twelve edges that correspond one - for - one with the features of a regular oct ##ah ##ed ##ron . [SEP]
[CLS] more generally , an oct ##ah ##ed ##ron can be any poly ##hedron with eight faces . [SEP]
[CLS] the regular oct ##ah ##ed ##ron has 6 vertices and 12 edges , the minimum for an oct ##ah ##ed ##ron ; irregular oct ##ah ##ed ##ra may have as many as 12 vertices and 18 edges . [SEP]
[CLS] ( two poly ##hed ##ra are " topological ##ly distinct " if they have intrinsic ##ally different arrangements of faces and vertices , such that it is impossible to di ##stor ##t one into the other simply by changing the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces . ) [SEP]
[CLS] a framework of repeating te ##tra ##hedron ##s and oct ##ah ##ed ##rons was invented by buck ##minster fuller in the 1950s , known as a space frame , commonly regarded as the strongest structure for resisting can ##tile ##ver stresses . [SEP]
[CLS] a regular oct ##ah ##ed ##ron can be augmented into a te ##tra ##hedron by adding 4 te ##tra ##hed ##ra on alternate ##d faces . [SEP]
[CLS] the oct ##ah ##ed ##ron is one of a family of uniform poly ##hed ##ra related to the cube . [SEP]
[CLS] the regular oct ##ah ##ed ##ron can also be considered a " rec ##ti ##fied te ##tra ##hedron " – and can be called a " te ##tra ##tet ##rah ##ed ##ron " . [SEP]
[CLS] the oct ##ah ##ed ##ron as a " te ##tra ##tet ##rah ##ed ##ron " exists in a sequence of sy ##mme ##tries of quasi ##re ##gul ##ar poly ##hed ##ra and til ##ings with vertex configurations ( 3 . " [SEP]
[CLS] " n " ) , progressing from til ##ings of the sphere to the euclidean plane and into the hyper ##bolic plane . [SEP]
[CLS] as a tri ##gonal anti ##pr ##ism , the oct ##ah ##ed ##ron is related to the he ##xa ##gonal di ##hedral symmetry family . [SEP]
