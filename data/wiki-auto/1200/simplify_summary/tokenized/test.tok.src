[CLS] atomic physics is the field of physics that studies atoms as an isolated system of electrons and an atomic nucleus . [SEP]
[CLS] it is primarily concerned with the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus and the processes by which these arrangements change . [SEP]
[CLS] this comprises ions , neutral atoms and , unless otherwise stated , it can be assumed that the term " atom " includes ions . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " atomic physics " can be associated with nuclear power and nuclear weapons , due to the synonymous use of " atomic " and " nuclear " in standard english . [SEP]
[CLS] physicist ##s distinguish between atomic physics — which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons — and nuclear physics , which studies nuclear reactions and special properties of atomic nuclei . [SEP]
[CLS] as with many scientific fields , strict del ##ine ##ation can be highly con ##tri ##ved and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of " atomic , molecular , and optical physics " . [SEP]
[CLS] physics research groups are usually so classified . [SEP]
[CLS] atomic physics primarily considers atoms in isolation . [SEP]
[CLS] atomic models will consist of a single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not concerned with the formation of molecules ( although much of the physics is identical ) , nor does it examine atoms in a solid state as condensed matter . [SEP]
[CLS] it is concerned with processes such as ion ##ization and ex ##cit ##ation by photon ##s or collisions with atomic particles . [SEP]
[CLS] while modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic , if one considers atoms in a gas or plasma then the time - scales for atom - atom interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic processes that are generally considered . [SEP]
[CLS] this means that the individual atoms can be treated as if each were in isolation , as the vast majority of the time they are . [SEP]
[CLS] by this consideration atomic physics provides the underlying theory in plasma physics and atmospheric physics , even though both deal with very large numbers of atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] electrons form notion ##al shells around the nucleus . [SEP]
[CLS] these are normally in a ground state but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light ( photon ##s ) , magnetic fields , or interaction with a col ##lid ##ing particle ( typically ions or other electrons ) . [SEP]
[CLS] if the electron absorb ##s a quantity of energy less than the binding energy , it will be transferred to an excited state . [SEP]
[CLS] after a certain time , the electron in an excited state will " jump " ( undergo a transition ) to a lower state . [SEP]
[CLS] in a neutral atom , the system will emi ##t a photon of the difference in energy , since energy is conserved . [SEP]
[CLS] if an inner electron has absorbed more than the binding energy ( so that the atom ion ##izes ) , then a more outer electron may undergo a transition to fill the inner orbital . [SEP]
[CLS] in this case , a visible photon or a characteristic x - ray is emitted , or a phenomenon known as the aug ##er effect may take place , where the released energy is transferred to another bound electron , causing it to go into the continuum . [SEP]
[CLS] the aug ##er effect allows one to multi ##ply ion ##ize an atom with a single photon . [SEP]
[CLS] there are rather strict selection rules as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by ex ##cit ##ation by light — however there are no such rules for ex ##cit ##ation by collision processes . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the earliest steps towards atomic physics was the recognition that matter was composed of " atoms " . [SEP]
[CLS] it forms a part of the texts written in 6th century bc to 2nd century bc such as those of demo ##cr ##it ##us or va ##ish ##esh ##ika sutra written by kan ##ad . [SEP]
[CLS] this theory was later developed in the modern sense of the basic unit of a chemical element by the british chemist and physicist john dalton in the 18th century . [SEP]
[CLS] at this stage , it wasn ' t clear what atoms were although they could be described and classified by their properties ( in bulk ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the invention of the periodic system of elements by men ##del ##ee ##v was another great step forward . [SEP]
[CLS] the true beginning of atomic physics is marked by the discovery of spectral lines and attempts to describe the phenomenon , most notably by joseph von fra ##un ##hof ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] the study of these lines led to the bo ##hr atom model and to the birth of quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] in seeking to explain atomic spectra an entirely new mathematical model of matter was revealed . [SEP]
[CLS] as far as atoms and their electron shells were concerned , not only did this yield a better overall description , i . e . the atomic orbital model , but it also provided a new theoretical basis for chemistry ( quantum chemistry ) and spectroscopy . [SEP]
[CLS] since the second world war , both theoretical and experimental fields have advanced at a rapid pace . [SEP]
[CLS] this can be attributed to progress in computing technology , which has allowed larger and more sophisticated models of atomic structure and associated collision processes . [SEP]
[CLS] similar technological advances in accelerator ##s , detectors , magnetic field generation and lasers have greatly assisted experimental work . [SEP]
