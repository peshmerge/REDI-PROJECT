[CLS] it is primarily concerned with the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus and the processes by which these arrangements change . [SEP]
[CLS] this comprises ions , neutral atoms and , unless otherwise stated , it can be assumed that the term " atom " includes ions . [SEP]
[CLS] physicist ##s distinguish between atomic physics — which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons — and nuclear physics , which studies nuclear reactions and special properties of atomic nuclei . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not concerned with the formation of molecules ( although much of the physics is identical ) , nor does it examine atoms in a solid state as condensed matter . [SEP]
[CLS] while modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic , if one considers atoms in a gas or plasma then the time - scales for atom - atom interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic processes that are generally considered . [SEP]
[CLS] by this consideration atomic physics provides the underlying theory in plasma physics and atmospheric physics , even though both deal with very large numbers of atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] these are normally in a ground state but can be excited by the absorption of energy from light ( photon ##s ) , magnetic fields , or interaction with a col ##lid ##ing particle ( typically ions or other electrons ) . [SEP]
[CLS] if the electron absorb ##s a quantity of energy less than the binding energy , it will be transferred to an excited state . [SEP]
[CLS] after a certain time , the electron in an excited state will " jump " ( undergo a transition ) to a lower state . [SEP]
[CLS] in a neutral atom , the system will emi ##t a photon of the difference in energy , since energy is conserved . [SEP]
[CLS] in this case , a visible photon or a characteristic x - ray is emitted , or a phenomenon known as the aug ##er effect may take place , where the released energy is transferred to another bound electron , causing it to go into the continuum . [SEP]
[CLS] there are rather strict selection rules as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by ex ##cit ##ation by light — however there are no such rules for ex ##cit ##ation by collision processes . [SEP]
[CLS] this theory was later developed in the modern sense of the basic unit of a chemical element by the british chemist and physicist john dalton in the 18th century . [SEP]
[CLS] at this stage , it wasn ' t clear what atoms were although they could be described and classified by their properties ( in bulk ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the true beginning of atomic physics is marked by the discovery of spectral lines and attempts to describe the phenomenon , most notably by joseph von fra ##un ##hof ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] as far as atoms and their electron shells were concerned , not only did this yield a better overall description , i . e . [SEP]
[CLS] the atomic orbital model , but it also provided a new theoretical basis for chemistry ( quantum chemistry ) and spectroscopy . [SEP]
[CLS] since the second world war , both theoretical and experimental fields have advanced at a rapid pace . [SEP]
[CLS] this can be attributed to progress in computing technology , which has allowed larger and more sophisticated models of atomic structure and associated collision processes . [SEP]
