the local group is the galaxy group that includes the milky way .
it has a total mass of about 3 million solar masses .
it has two clusters of galaxies : the milky way andromeda galaxy and the andromeda galaxy .
the two clusters are separated by about 0.8 mpc and move towards one another with a velocity of .
the group itself is part of the virgo supercluster , which may be a part of the laniakea supercluster .
most of them are dwarf galaxies .
the triangulum galaxy is the third largest galaxy in the local group , at about , and the third spiral galaxy .
it may or may not be a companion to the andromeda galaxy .
pisces dwarf galaxy is equidistant from the andromeda galaxy and the triangulum galaxy .
the membership of ngc 3109 , with its companions sextans a and the antlia dwarf galaxy , is uncertain due to extreme distances from the centre of the local group .
the other members of the group are likely to be taken from these large subgroups : ic 10 , ic 1613 , phoenix dwarf galaxy , tucana dwarf galaxy , cetus dwarf galaxy , pegasus dwarf galaxy , wolf – lundmark – melotte , and sagittarius dwarf galaxy .
the term " local group " was first used by edwin hubble in 1936 .
he described it as " a typical small group of nebulae which is isolated in the general field " .
he also identified ic 10 as a possible part of local group .
by 2003 , the number of known local group members had increased from his initial 12 to 36 .
