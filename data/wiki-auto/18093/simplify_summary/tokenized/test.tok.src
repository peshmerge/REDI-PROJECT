[CLS] the local group is the galaxy group that includes the milky way . [SEP]
[CLS] it has a total diameter of roughly 3 mp ##c ( or 10 ml ##y ≈ ) , and a total mass of the order of solar masses . [SEP]
[CLS] it consists of two clusters of galaxies in a " dumb ##bell " shape , the milky way and its satellites on one hand , and the and ##rom ##eda galaxy and its satellites on the other . [SEP]
[CLS] the two clusters are separated by about 0 . 8 mp ##c and move towards one another with a velocity of . [SEP]
[CLS] the group itself is a part of the larger vi ##rgo super ##cl ##ust ##er , which may be a part of the lan ##ia ##ke ##a super ##cl ##ust ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] the total number of galaxies in the local group is unknown ( due to its partial o ##cc ##lusion by the milky way ) but known to exceed 54 , most of them being dwarf galaxies . [SEP]
[CLS] the tri ##ang ##ulum galaxy is the third largest member of the local group , at about , and the third spiral galaxy . [SEP]
[CLS] it may or may not be a companion to the and ##rom ##eda galaxy . [SEP]
[CLS] pi ##sc ##es dwarf galaxy is e ##qui ##dis ##tan ##t from the and ##rom ##eda galaxy and the tri ##ang ##ulum galaxy , so it may be a satellite of either . [SEP]
[CLS] the membership of ngc 310 ##9 , with its companions sex ##tan ##s a and the ant ##lia dwarf galaxy , is uncertain due to extreme distances from the center of the local group . [SEP]
[CLS] the other members of the group are likely gravitational ##ly secluded from these large subgroup ##s : ic 10 , ic 161 ##3 , phoenix dwarf galaxy , leo a , tu ##cana dwarf galaxy , ce ##tus dwarf galaxy , pegasus dwarf irregular galaxy , wolf – lund ##mark – mel ##otte , aqua ##rius dwarf galaxy , and sa ##git ##tar ##ius dwarf irregular galaxy . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " the local group " was introduced by edwin hub ##ble in chapter vi of his 1936 book " the realm of the nebula ##e " . [SEP]
[CLS] there , he described it as " a typical small group of nebula ##e which is isolated in the general field " and del ##ine ##ated , by decreasing lu ##min ##osity , its members to be m3 ##1 , milky way , m3 ##3 , large mage ##llan ##ic cloud , small mage ##llan ##ic cloud , m3 ##2 , ngc 205 , ngc 68 ##22 , ngc 185 , ic 161 ##3 and ngc 147 . [SEP]
[CLS] he also identified ic 10 as a possible part of local group . [SEP]
[CLS] by 2003 , the number of known local group members had increased from his initial 12 to 36 . [SEP]
