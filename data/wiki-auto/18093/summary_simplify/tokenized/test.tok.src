[CLS] it consists of two clusters of galaxies in a " dumb ##bell " shape , the milky way and its satellites on one hand , and the and ##rom ##eda galaxy and its satellites on the other . [SEP]
[CLS] the two clusters are separated by about 0 . 8 mp ##c and move towards one another with a velocity of . [SEP]
[CLS] the total number of galaxies in the local group is unknown ( due to its partial o ##cc ##lusion by the milky way ) but known to exceed 54 , most of them being dwarf galaxies . [SEP]
[CLS] the tri ##ang ##ulum galaxy is the third largest member of the local group , at about , and the third spiral galaxy . [SEP]
[CLS] pi ##sc ##es dwarf galaxy is e ##qui ##dis ##tan ##t from the and ##rom ##eda galaxy and the tri ##ang ##ulum galaxy , so it may be a satellite of either . [SEP]
[CLS] the membership of ngc 310 ##9 , with its companions sex ##tan ##s a and the ant ##lia dwarf galaxy , is uncertain due to extreme distances from the center of the local group . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " the local group " was introduced by edwin hub ##ble in chapter vi of his 1936 book " the realm of the nebula ##e " . [SEP]
[CLS] by 2003 , the number of known local group members had increased from his initial 12 to 36 . [SEP]
