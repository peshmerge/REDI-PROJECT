It consists of two clusters of galaxies in a "dumbbell" shape, the Milky Way and its satellites on one hand, and the Andromeda Galaxy and its satellites on the other.
The two clusters are separated by about 0.8 Mpc and move towards one another with a velocity of .
The total number of galaxies in the Local Group is unknown (due to its partial occlusion by the Milky Way) but known to exceed 54, most of them being dwarf galaxies.
The Triangulum Galaxy is the third largest member of the Local Group, at about , and the third spiral galaxy.
Pisces Dwarf Galaxy is equidistant from the Andromeda Galaxy and the Triangulum Galaxy, so it may be a satellite of either.
The membership of NGC 3109, with its companions Sextans A and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy, is uncertain due to extreme distances from the center of the Local Group.
The term "The Local Group" was introduced by Edwin Hubble in Chapter VI of his 1936 book "The Realm of the Nebulae".
By 2003, the number of known Local Group members had increased from his initial 12 to 36.
