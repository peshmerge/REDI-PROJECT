[CLS] nap ##al ##m b is the more modern version of nap ##al ##m ( utilizing st ##yre ##ne derivatives ) and , although distinctly different in its chemical composition , is often referred to simply as " nap ##al ##m " . [SEP]
[CLS] a team led by chemist louis fi ##ese ##r originally developed nap ##al ##m for the united states chemical warfare service in 1942 in a secret laboratory at harvard university . [SEP]
[CLS] of immediate first interest was its via ##bility as an inc ##end ##iary device to be used in fire bombing campaigns during world war ii and its potential to be coherent ##ly projected into a solid stream that would carry for distance ( instead of the bloom ##y fire ##ball of pure gasoline ) resulted in widespread adoption in infantry / combat engineer flame ##th ##row ##ers as well . [SEP]
[CLS] nap ##al ##m burns at the same temperature as gasoline , and for a greater duration , as well as being more easily dispersed and sticking ten ##acious ##ly to its targets ; these traits make it extremely effective ( and controversial ) in the anti - structure and anti ##person ##nel role . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been widely used in both the air and ground role , with the largest used to date being via air - dropped bombs in world war ii ( most notably in the gr ##ues ##ome ##ly effective inc ##end ##iary attacks on japanese cities in 1945 ) , and later close air support roles in korea and vietnam . [SEP]
[CLS] nap ##al ##m also has fueled most of the flame ##th ##row ##ers ( tank , ship and infantry - based ) used since world war ii , giving them much greater range , and was used in this role as a common ( and feared ) weapon of urban combat by both the axis and the allies in world war ii . [SEP]
[CLS] multiple nations ( including the united states , china , russia , iran and north korea ) maintain large stock ##pile ##s of nap ##al ##m - based weapons of various types . [SEP]
[CLS] it is believed to have been formulated to burn at a specific rate and to adhere to surfaces to increase its stopping power . [SEP]
[CLS] late ##x , used in these early forms of inc ##end ##iary devices , became scarce , since natural rubber was almost impossible to obtain after the japanese army captured the rubber plantations in malaya , indonesia , vietnam , and thailand . [SEP]
[CLS] this shortage of natural rubber prompted chemist ##s at us companies such as dupont and standard oil , and researchers at harvard university , to develop factory - made alternatives — artificial rubber for all uses , including vehicle tires , tank tracks , gas ##ke ##ts , hose ##s , medical supplies and rain clothing . [SEP]
[CLS] a team of chemist ##s led by louis fi ##ese ##r at harvard university was the first to develop synthetic nap ##al ##m , during 1942 . [SEP]
[CLS] " the production of nap ##al ##m was first entrusted to nu ##ode ##x products , and by the middle of april 1942 they had developed a brown , dry powder that was not sticky by itself , but when mixed with gasoline turned into an extremely sticky and in ##fl ##am ##mable substance . " [SEP]
[CLS] one of fi ##ese ##r ' s colleagues suggested adding phosphorus to the mix which increased the " ability to penetrate deeply . . . into the mu ##scu ##lat ##ure , where it would continue to burn day after day . " [SEP]
[CLS] this new mixture of chemicals was widely used in the second world war in inc ##end ##iary bombs and in flame ##th ##row ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] after news reports of nap ##al ##m b ' s deadly and di ##sf ##ig ##uring effects were published , dow chemical experienced boycott ##s of its products , and its recruit ##ers for new chemist ##s , chemical engineers , etc . , graduating from college were subject to campus boycott ##s and protests . [SEP]
[CLS] nap ##al ##m was first employed in inc ##end ##iary bombs and went on to be used as fuel for flame ##th ##row ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] the first recorded strategic use of nap ##al ##m inc ##end ##iary bombs occurred in an attack by the us army air force on berlin on 6 march 1944 , using american an - m ##7 ##6 inc ##end ##iary bombs with pt - 1 ( p ##yr ##oge ##l ) fill ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] 140 wing raf , second tactical air force on 14 july 1944 , which also employed the an - m ##7 ##6 inc ##end ##iary in a rep ##ris ##al attack on the 17th ss panzer ##gren ##adi ##er division " " got ##z von be ##rl ##ichi ##ngen " " in bonn ##eu ##il - mat ##ours . [SEP]
[CLS] soldiers of this wa ##ffen ss unit had captured and then killed a british sas prisoner - of - war , lt . tom ##os stephens , taking part in operation bulb ##ask ##et , and seven local resistance fighters . [SEP]
[CLS] further use of nap ##al ##m by american forces occurred in the pacific theater of operations , where in 1944 and 1945 , nap ##al ##m was used as a tactical weapon against japanese bunker ##s , pill ##box ##es , tunnels , and other fortifications , especially on sai ##pan , i ##wo jim ##a , the philippines , and okinawa , where deeply dug - in japanese troops refused to surrender . [SEP]
[CLS] then , when the u . s . army air forces on the mariana ##s islands ran out of conventional the ##rmi ##te inc ##end ##iary bombs for their b - 29 super ##fort ##resses to drop on japanese cities , its top commanders , such as general curtis le ##may , used nap ##al ##m bombs to continue fire raids on the large japanese cities . [SEP]
[CLS] in the european theater of operations nap ##al ##m was used by american forces in the siege of la rochelle in april 1945 against german soldiers ( and inadvertently french civilians in roy ##an ) – about two weeks before the end of the war . [SEP]
[CLS] these ground forces in north korea were outnumbered at points of defense by chinese and north koreans , but u . s . air force and navy aviator ##s had control of the air over nearly all of the korean peninsula . [SEP]
[CLS] hence , close air support of the ground troops along the border between north korea and south korea was vital , and the american and other u . n . aviator ##s used nap ##al ##m b for attacks in north korea . [SEP]
[CLS] in john ford ' s 1951 documentary , " this is korea " , footage of nap ##al ##m deployment is accompanied by a voice - over by john wayne saying , " burn ' em out , cook ' em , fry ' em " ; the " new york herald tribune " hailed " nap ##al ##m , the no . [SEP]
[CLS] winston churchill , among others , criticized american use of nap ##al ##m in korea , calling it " very cruel " , as the us / un forces , he said , were " splash ##ing it all over the civilian population " , " tor ##turing great masses of people " . [SEP]
[CLS] nap ##al ##m became an intrinsic element of u . s . military action during the vietnam war as forces made increasing use of it for its tactical and psychological effects . [SEP]
[CLS] the u . s . air force and u . s . navy used nap ##al ##m with great effect against all kinds of targets , such as troops , tanks , buildings , jungle ##s , and even railroad tunnels . [SEP]
[CLS] a variant of nap ##al ##m was produced in rhodesia for a type of ordnance known as " fran ##tan " between 1968 and 1978 and was deployed extensively by the rhodesia ##n air force during that country ' s bush war . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 1978 , herbert us ##he ##wo ##ku ##nz ##e , minister of health for the zimbabwe african national union ( za ##nu ) produced photographic evidence of purported civilian victims of rhodesia ##n nap ##al ##m strikes , which he circulated during a tour of the us . [SEP]
[CLS] the government of mozambique and the zimbabwe african people ' s union ( za ##pu ) also issued claims at around the same time that nap ##al ##m strikes against guerrilla targets had become a common feature in rhodesia ##n military operations both at home and abroad . [SEP]
[CLS] recently , turkey has been accused of using nap ##al ##m in its war against kurdish militias over af ##rin . [SEP]
[CLS] in this implementation , nap ##al ##m fires can create an atmosphere of greater than 20 % carbon mono ##xide and fires ##torm ##s with self - per ##pet ##uating winds of up to 70 mph . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the stockholm international peace research institute ( sip ##ri ) , countries are considered a party to the convention , which entered into force as international law in december 1983 , as long as they rat ##ify at least two of the five protocols . [SEP]
[CLS] approximately 25 years after the general assembly adopted it , the united states signed it on january 21 , 2009 , president barack obama ' s first full day in office . [SEP]
[CLS] its ratification , however , is subject to a reservation that says that the treaty can be ignored if it would save civilian lives . [SEP]
