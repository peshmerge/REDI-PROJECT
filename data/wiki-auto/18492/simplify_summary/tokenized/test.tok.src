[CLS] a lex ##eme is a unit of lexi ##cal meaning that under ##lies a set of words that are related through in ##fle ##ction . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a basic abstract unit of meaning , a unit of morphological analysis in linguistics that roughly corresponds to a set of forms taken by a single root word . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in english , " run " , " runs " , " ran " and " running " are forms of the same lex ##eme , which can be represented as run . [SEP]
[CLS] one form , the le ##mma ( or citation form ) , is chosen by convention as the canonical form of a lex ##eme . [SEP]
[CLS] the le ##mma is the form used in di ##ction ##aries as an entry ' s head ##word . [SEP]
[CLS] other forms of a lex ##eme are often listed later in the entry if they are uncommon or irregular ##ly - in ##fle ##cted . [SEP]
[CLS] a lex ##eme belongs to a particular syn ##ta ##ctic category , has a certain meaning ( semantic value ) and , in in ##fle ##cting languages , has a corresponding in ##fle ##ction ##al paradigm . [SEP]
[CLS] that is , a lex ##eme in many languages will have many different forms . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the lex ##eme run has a present third person singular form " runs " , a present non - third - person singular form " run " ( which also functions as the past part ##ici ##ple and non - finite form ) , a past form " ran " , and a present part ##ici ##ple " running " . [SEP]
[CLS] ( it does not include " runner , runners , run ##nable " etc . ) the use of the forms of a lex ##eme is governed by rules of grammar . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of english verbs such as run , they include subject - verb agreement and compound tense rules , which determine the form of a verb that can be used in a given sentence . [SEP]
[CLS] in many formal theories of language , lex ##eme ##s have sub ##cate ##gor ##ization frames to account for the number and types of complement ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] they occur within sentences and other syn ##ta ##ctic structures . [SEP]
[CLS] the notion of the lex ##eme is central to morphology , the basis for defining other concepts in that field . [SEP]
[CLS] the compound root mor ##ph ##eme + derivation ##al mor ##ph ##eme ##s is often called the stem . [SEP]
[CLS] the decomposition stem + des ##inen ##ce can then be used to study in ##fle ##ction . [SEP]
