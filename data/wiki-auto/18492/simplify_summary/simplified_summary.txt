a lexeme is a unit of lexical meaning that is underlies a set of words that are related through inflection .
for example , in english , " run " , " runs " , " ran " and " running " are forms of the same lexeme , which can be represented as run .
one form , the lemma aarhus or citation formocation , is chosen by convention as the canonical form of a lexeme .
lemmas are used in dictionaries as the headwords .
in many languages , like english , there are many different forms .
for example , the lexeme run has a present-person singular form " runs " .
in english , verbs such as run are subject-verb agreement and compound rules .
in many formal theories of language , lexemes have subcategorization frames to account for the number and types of complements .
the lexeme is the basis for defining other concepts in that field .
