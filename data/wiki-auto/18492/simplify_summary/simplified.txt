a lexeme is a unit of lexical meaning that is underlies a set of words that are related through inflection .
it is a basic unit of meaning .
for example , in english , " run " , " runs " , " ran " and " running " are forms of the same lexeme , which can be represented as run .
one form , the lemma aarhus or citation formocation , is chosen by convention as the canonical form of a lexeme .
lemmas are used in dictionaries as the headwords .
other forms of a lexeme are usually listed later in the entry .
a lexeme belongs to a particular syntactic category .
in many languages , like english , there are many different forms .
for example , the lexeme run has a present-person singular form " runs " .
it does not include " runner , runners , runnable " etc .
in english , verbs such as run are subject-verb agreement and compound rules .
in many formal theories of language , lexemes have subcategorization frames to account for the number and types of complements .
they occur within sentences and other syntactic structures .
the lexeme is the basis for defining other concepts in that field .
the compound root morpheme + derivational morphemes is often called the stem .
the decomposition stem + desinence can then be used to study inflection .
