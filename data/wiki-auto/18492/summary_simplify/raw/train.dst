A lexeme is a unit of lexical meaning that underlies a set of words that are related through inflection.
For example, in English, "run", "runs", "ran" and "running" are forms of the same lexeme, which can be represented as RUN.
One form, the lemma (or citation form), is chosen by convention as the canonical form of a lexeme.
The lemma is the form used in dictionaries as an entry's headword.
Other forms of a lexeme are often listed later in the entry if they are uncommon or irregularly-inflected.
That is, a lexeme in many languages will have many different forms.
In the case of English verbs such as RUN, they include subject-verb agreement and compound tense rules, which determine the form of a verb that can be used in a given sentence.
In many formal theories of language, lexemes have subcategorization frames to account for the number and types of complements.
The notion of the lexeme is central to morphology, the basis for defining other concepts in that field.
