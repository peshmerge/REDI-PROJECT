[CLS] the internet protocol ( ip ) is the principal communications protocol in the internet protocol suite for relay ##ing data ##gram ##s across network boundaries . [SEP]
[CLS] it also defines addressing methods that are used to label the data ##gram with source and destination information . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , ip was the connection ##less data ##gram service in the original transmission control program introduced by vin ##t ce ##rf and bob kahn in 1974 , which was complement ##ed by a connection - oriented service that became the basis for the transmission control protocol ( tc ##p ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the first major version of ip , internet protocol version 4 ( ip ##v ##4 ) , is the dominant protocol of the internet . [SEP]
[CLS] its successor , internet protocol version 6 ( ip ##v ##6 ) , has been growing in adoption , reaching almost 25 % of all internet traffic as of october , 2018 . [SEP]
[CLS] the internet protocol is responsible for addressing host interfaces , en ##cap ##sul ##ating data into data ##gram ##s ( including fragmentation and re ##asse ##mb ##ly ) and routing data ##gram ##s from a source host interface to a destination host interface across one or more ip networks . [SEP]
[CLS] for these purposes , the internet protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system . [SEP]
[CLS] the ip header includes source ip address , destination ip address , and other metadata needed to route and deliver the data ##gram . [SEP]
[CLS] ip addressing en ##tails the assignment of ip addresses and associated parameters to host interfaces . [SEP]
[CLS] the address space is divided into sub ##net ##works , involving the designation of network prefix ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] ip routing is performed by all hosts , as well as route ##rs , whose main function is to transport packets across network boundaries . [SEP]
[CLS] route ##rs communicate with one another via specially designed routing protocols , either interior gateway protocols or exterior gateway protocols , as needed for the topology of the network . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 1974 , the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( ieee ) published a paper entitled " a protocol for packet network inter ##com ##mun ##ication " . [SEP]
[CLS] the mono ##lithic transmission control program was later divided into a modular architecture consisting of the transmission control protocol and user data ##gram protocol at the transport layer and the internet protocol at the internet layer . [SEP]
[CLS] the dominant internet ##working protocol in the internet layer in use today is ip ##v ##4 ; the number 4 is the protocol version number carried in every ip data ##gram . [SEP]
[CLS] version number 5 was used by the internet stream protocol , an experimental streaming protocol . [SEP]
[CLS] although adoption of ip ##v ##6 has been slow , as of june 2008 , all united states government systems have demonstrated basic infrastructure support for ip ##v ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] the assignment of the new protocol as ip ##v ##6 was uncertain until due dil ##igen ##ce revealed that ip ##v ##6 had not yet been used previously . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##9 ( aka tc ##p and ud ##p with big addresses ) res ##ur ##face ##d mid - 2004 and purported ##ly being researched and adopted in china , which china di ##so ##wn ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the design of the internet protocol suite adhere ##s to the end - to - end principle , a concept adapted from the cy ##cl ##ades project . [SEP]
[CLS] under the end - to - end principle , the network infrastructure is considered inherently unreliable at any single network element or transmission medium and is dynamic in terms of availability of links and nodes . [SEP]
[CLS] no central monitoring or performance measurement facility exists that tracks or maintains the state of the network . [SEP]
[CLS] for the benefit of reducing network complexity , the intelligence in the network is purposely located in the end nodes . [SEP]
[CLS] as a consequence of this design , the internet protocol only provides best - effort delivery and its service is characterized as unreliable . [SEP]
[CLS] because routing is dynamic , meaning every packet is treated independently , and because the network maintains no state based on the path of prior packets , different packets may be routed to the same destination via different paths , resulting in out - of - order delivery to the receiver . [SEP]
[CLS] all error conditions in the network must be detected and compensated by the participating end nodes . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , a host may buffer network data to ensure correct ordering before the data is delivered to an application . [SEP]
[CLS] although the internet control message protocol ( ic ##mp ) provides notification of errors , a routing node is not required to not ##ify either end node of errors . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##6 , by contrast , operates without header checks ##ums , since current link layer technology is assumed to provide sufficient error detection . [SEP]
[CLS] the dynamic nature of the internet and the diversity of its components provide no guarantee that any particular path is actually capable of , or suitable for , performing the data transmission requested . [SEP]
[CLS] facilities exist to examine the maximum transmission unit ( mt ##u ) size of the local link and path mt ##u discovery can be used for the entire intended path to the destination . [SEP]
[CLS] an ip ##v ##6 network does not perform fragmentation or re ##asse ##mb ##ly , and as per the end - to - end principle , requires end stations and higher - layer protocols to avoid exceeding the network ' s mt ##u . [SEP]
[CLS] during the design phase of the ar ##pan ##et and the early internet , the security aspects and needs of a public , international network could not be adequately anticipated . [SEP]
