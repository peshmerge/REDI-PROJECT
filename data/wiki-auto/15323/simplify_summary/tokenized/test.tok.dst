[CLS] the internet protocol ( ip ) is the principal communications protocol in the internet protocol suite for relay ##ing data ##gram ##s across network boundaries . [SEP]
[CLS] its routing function enables internet ##working , and essentially establishes the internet . [SEP]
[CLS] ip has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the ip addresses in the packet header ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] for this purpose , ip defines packet structures that en ##cap ##sul ##ate the data to be delivered . [SEP]
[CLS] it also defines addressing methods that are used to label the data ##gram with source and destination information . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , ip was the connection ##less data ##gram service in the original transmission control program introduced by vin ##t ce ##rf and bob kahn in 1974 , which was complement ##ed by a connection - oriented service that became the basis for the transmission control protocol ( tc ##p ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the internet protocol suite is therefore often referred to as " tc ##p / ip " . [SEP]
[CLS] the first major version of ip , internet protocol version 4 ( ip ##v ##4 ) , is the dominant protocol of the internet . [SEP]
[CLS] its successor , internet protocol version 6 ( ip ##v ##6 ) , has been growing in adoption , reaching almost 25 % of all internet traffic as of october , 2018 . [SEP]
[CLS] the internet protocol is responsible for addressing host interfaces , en ##cap ##sul ##ating data into data ##gram ##s ( including fragmentation and re ##asse ##mb ##ly ) and routing data ##gram ##s from a source host interface to a destination host interface across one or more ip networks . [SEP]
[CLS] for these purposes , the internet protocol defines the format of packets and provides an addressing system . [SEP]
[CLS] each data ##gram has two components : a header and a payload . [SEP]
[CLS] the ip header includes source ip address , destination ip address , and other metadata needed to route and deliver the data ##gram . [SEP]
[CLS] the payload is the data that is transported . [SEP]
[CLS] this method of nesting the data payload in a packet with a header is called en ##cap ##sul ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] ip addressing en ##tails the assignment of ip addresses and associated parameters to host interfaces . [SEP]
[CLS] the address space is divided into sub ##net ##works , involving the designation of network prefix ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] ip routing is performed by all hosts , as well as route ##rs , whose main function is to transport packets across network boundaries . [SEP]
[CLS] route ##rs communicate with one another via specially designed routing protocols , either interior gateway protocols or exterior gateway protocols , as needed for the topology of the network . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 1974 , the institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( ieee ) published a paper entitled " a protocol for packet network inter ##com ##mun ##ication " . [SEP]
[CLS] the paper ' s authors , vin ##t ce ##rf and bob kahn , described an internet ##working protocol for sharing resources using packet switching among network nodes . [SEP]
[CLS] a central control component of this model was the " transmission control program " that incorporated both connection - oriented links and data ##gram services between hosts . [SEP]
[CLS] the mono ##lithic transmission control program was later divided into a modular architecture consisting of the transmission control protocol and user data ##gram protocol at the transport layer and the internet protocol at the internet layer . [SEP]
[CLS] the model became known as the " department of defense ( dod ) internet model " and " internet protocol suite " , and informally as " tc ##p / ip " . [SEP]
[CLS] ip versions 0 to 3 were experimental versions , used between 1977 and 1979 . [SEP]
[CLS] the dominant internet ##working protocol in the internet layer in use today is ip ##v ##4 ; the number 4 is the protocol version number carried in every ip data ##gram . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##4 is described in ( 1981 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] version number 5 was used by the internet stream protocol , an experimental streaming protocol . [SEP]
[CLS] the successor to ip ##v ##4 is ip ##v ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##6 was a result of several years of experimentation and dial ##og during which various protocol models were proposed , such as t ##p / ix , pip and tuba ( tc ##p and ud ##p with bigger addresses , ) . [SEP]
[CLS] its most prominent difference from version 4 is the size of the addresses . [SEP]
[CLS] while ip ##v ##4 uses 32 bits for addressing , yielding c . 4 . 3 billion addresses , ip ##v ##6 uses 128 - bit addresses providing ca . 340 und ##ec ##ill ##ion , or addresses . [SEP]
[CLS] although adoption of ip ##v ##6 has been slow , as of june 2008 , all united states government systems have demonstrated basic infrastructure support for ip ##v ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] the assignment of the new protocol as ip ##v ##6 was uncertain until due dil ##igen ##ce revealed that ip ##v ##6 had not yet been used previously . [SEP]
[CLS] other internet protocols have been assigned numbers according by ian ##a such as ip ##v ##7 , ip ##v ##8 , and ip ##v ##9 . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##9 ( aka tc ##p and ud ##p with big addresses ) res ##ur ##face ##d mid - 2004 and purported ##ly being researched and adopted in china , which china di ##so ##wn ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] on april 1 , 1994 , the ie ##tf published an april fools ' day joke about ip ##v ##9 . [SEP]
[CLS] the design of the internet protocol suite adhere ##s to the end - to - end principle , a concept adapted from the cy ##cl ##ades project . [SEP]
[CLS] under the end - to - end principle , the network infrastructure is considered inherently unreliable at any single network element or transmission medium and is dynamic in terms of availability of links and nodes . [SEP]
[CLS] no central monitoring or performance measurement facility exists that tracks or maintains the state of the network . [SEP]
[CLS] for the benefit of reducing network complexity , the intelligence in the network is purposely located in the end nodes . [SEP]
[CLS] as a consequence of this design , the internet protocol only provides best - effort delivery and its service is characterized as unreliable . [SEP]
[CLS] in network architectural language , it is a connection ##less protocol , in contrast to connection - oriented communication . [SEP]
[CLS] various error conditions may occur , such as data corruption , packet loss and du ##plication . [SEP]
[CLS] because routing is dynamic , meaning every packet is treated independently , and because the network maintains no state based on the path of prior packets , different packets may be routed to the same destination via different paths , resulting in out - of - order delivery to the receiver . [SEP]
[CLS] all error conditions in the network must be detected and compensated by the participating end nodes . [SEP]
[CLS] the upper layer protocols of the internet protocol suite are responsible for resolving reliability issues . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , a host may buffer network data to ensure correct ordering before the data is delivered to an application . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##4 provides safeguard ##s to ensure that the header of an ip packet is error - free . [SEP]
[CLS] a routing node disc ##ards packets that fail a header checks ##um test . [SEP]
[CLS] although the internet control message protocol ( ic ##mp ) provides notification of errors , a routing node is not required to not ##ify either end node of errors . [SEP]
[CLS] ip ##v ##6 , by contrast , operates without header checks ##ums , since current link layer technology is assumed to provide sufficient error detection . [SEP]
[CLS] the dynamic nature of the internet and the diversity of its components provide no guarantee that any particular path is actually capable of , or suitable for , performing the data transmission requested . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the technical constraints is the size of data packets allowed on a given link . [SEP]
[CLS] facilities exist to examine the maximum transmission unit ( mt ##u ) size of the local link and path mt ##u discovery can be used for the entire intended path to the destination . [SEP]
[CLS] the ip ##v ##4 internet ##working layer has the ability to automatically fragment the original data ##gram into smaller units for transmission . [SEP]
[CLS] in this case , ip provides re - ordering of fragments delivered out of order . [SEP]
[CLS] an ip ##v ##6 network does not perform fragmentation or re ##asse ##mb ##ly , and as per the end - to - end principle , requires end stations and higher - layer protocols to avoid exceeding the network ' s mt ##u . [SEP]
[CLS] the transmission control protocol ( tc ##p ) is an example of a protocol that adjust ##s its segment size to be smaller than the mt ##u . [SEP]
[CLS] the user data ##gram protocol ( ud ##p ) and ic ##mp disregard mt ##u size , thereby forcing ip to fragment oversized data ##gram ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] during the design phase of the ar ##pan ##et and the early internet , the security aspects and needs of a public , international network could not be adequately anticipated . [SEP]
[CLS] consequently , many internet protocols exhibited vu ##ln ##era ##bilities highlighted by network attacks and later security assessments . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2008 , a thorough security assessment and proposed mit ##iga ##tion of problems was published . [SEP]
[CLS] the ie ##tf has been pursuing further studies . [SEP]
