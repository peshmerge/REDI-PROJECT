at the end of the book there is a poem written from the point of view of a veteran comparing world war i to the trojan war .
aldington was a veteran of world war i .
when aldington first published his novel , he revised a number of passages to ensure the publication of his book would not be challenged .
he insisted that his publishers include a disclaimer in the original printing of the book with the following text : to my astonishment , my publisher informed me that words , phrases , sentences , and even passages , are at present taboo in england .
i have recorded nothing which i have not observed in human life , said nothing i do not believe to be true .
the publishers are removing what they believe would be considered objectionable , and are placing asterisks to show where omissions have been made .
in my opinion it is better for the book to appear mutilated than for me to say what i don â€™ t believe .
