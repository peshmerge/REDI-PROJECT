there was extensive censorship in england and many war novels had been banned or burned .
when aldington first published his novel , he revised a number of passages to ensure the publication of his book would not be challenged .
he insisted that his publishers include a disclaimer in the original printing of the book with the following text : to my astonishment , my publisher informed me that words , phrases , sentences , and even passages , are at present taboo in england .
i have recorded nothing which i have not observed in human life , said nothing i do not believe to be true .
the publishers are removing what they believe would be considered objectionable , and are placing asterisks to show where omissions have been made .
my opinion it is better for the book to appear mutilated than for me to say what i don â€™ t believe .
