[CLS] as a literary device , an all ##ego ##ry is a metaphor in which a character , place or event is used to deliver a broader message about real - world issues and occurrences . [SEP]
[CLS] all ##ego ##ry ( in the sense of the practice and use of all ##egorical devices and works ) has occurred widely throughout history in all forms of art , largely because it can readily illustrate or convey complex ideas and concepts in ways that are com ##pre ##hen ##sible or striking to its viewers , readers , or listeners . [SEP]
[CLS] writers or speakers typically use all ##ego ##ries as literary devices or as rhetoric ##al devices that convey ( semi - ) hidden or complex meanings through symbolic figures , actions , imagery , or events , which together create the moral , spiritual , or political meaning the author wishes to convey . [SEP]
[CLS] many all ##ego ##ries use person ##ification ##s of abstract concepts . [SEP]
[CLS] first attested in english in 138 ##2 , the word " all ##ego ##ry " comes from latin " all ##ego ##ria " , the latin ##isation of the greek α ##λ ##λ ##η ##γ ##ο ##ρ ##ια ( " all ##ego ##ria " ) , " veil ##ed language , figurative " , which in turn comes from both α ##λ ##λ ##ος ( " all ##os " ) , " another , different " and α ##γ ##ο ##ρ ##ε ##υ ##ω ( " ago ##re ##uo " ) , " to hara ##ng ##ue , to speak in the assembly " , which originates from α ##γ ##ο ##ρ ##α ( " ago ##ra " ) , " assembly " . [SEP]
[CLS] north ##rop fry ##e discussed what he termed a " continuum of all ##ego ##ry " , a spectrum that ranges from what he termed the " naive all ##ego ##ry " of " the faerie queen ##e " , to the more private all ##ego ##ries of modern paradox literature . [SEP]
[CLS] in this perspective , the characters in a " naive " all ##ego ##ry are not fully three - dimensional , for each aspect of their individual personalities and the events that be ##fall them em ##bo ##dies some moral quality or other abstraction ; the all ##ego ##ry has been selected first , and the details merely flesh it out . [SEP]
[CLS] the origins of all ##ego ##ry can be traced at least back to homer in his " quasi - all ##egorical " use of person ##ification ##s of , e . g . , terror ( dei ##mos ) and fear ( ph ##ob ##os ) at il . [SEP]
[CLS] the title of " first all ##ego ##rist , " however , is usually awarded to whoever was the earliest to put forth all ##egorical interpretations of homer . [SEP]
[CLS] this approach leads to two possible answers : the ##age ##nes of r ##he ##gi ##um ( whom por ##phy ##ry calls the " first all ##ego ##rist , " por ##ph . [SEP]
[CLS] or ph ##ere ##cy ##des of sy ##ros , both of whom are presumed to be active in the 6th century b . c . e . , though ph ##ere ##cy ##des is earlier and as he is often presumed to be the first writer of prose . [SEP]
[CLS] the debate is complex , since it demands we observe the distinction between two often con ##fl ##ated uses of the greek verb " all ##ego ##re ##in , " which can mean both " to speak all ##egorical ##ly " and " to interpret all ##egorical ##ly . " [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of " interpreting all ##egorical ##ly , " the ##age ##nes appears to be our earliest example . [SEP]
[CLS] presumably in response to proto - philosophical moral critique ##s of homer ( e . g . x ##eno ##pha ##nes fr . [SEP]
[CLS] 11 die ##ls - k ##ran ##z ) , the ##age ##nes proposed symbolic interpretations whereby the gods of the il ##iad actually stood for physical elements . [SEP]
[CLS] so , he ##ph ##est ##us represents fire , for instance ( for which see fr . [SEP]
[CLS] a2 in die ##ls - k ##ran ##z ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some scholars , however , argue that ph ##ere ##cy ##des co ##smo ##gon ##ic writings anticipated the ##age ##nes all ##egorical work , illustrated especially by his early placement of time ( ch ##ron ##os ) in his genealogy of the gods , which is thought to be a rein ##ter ##pre ##tation of the titan k ##ron ##os , from more traditional gene ##alo ##gies . [SEP]
[CLS] in classical literature two of the best - known all ##ego ##ries are the cave in plato ' s " republic " ( book vii ) and the story of the stomach and its members in the speech of men ##eni ##us ag ##rip ##pa ( liv ##y ii . [SEP]
[CLS] among the best - known examples of all ##ego ##ry , plato ' s all ##ego ##ry of the cave , forms a part of his larger work " the republic . " [SEP]
[CLS] in this all ##ego ##ry , plato describes a group of people who have lived chained in a cave all of their lives , facing a blank wall ( 51 ##4 ##a – b ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them and begin to as ##cr ##ibe forms to these shadows , using language to identify their world ( 51 ##4 ##c – 51 ##5 ##a ) . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the all ##ego ##ry , the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality , until one of them finds his way into the outside world where he sees the actual objects that produced the shadows . [SEP]
[CLS] he tries to tell the people in the cave of his discovery , but they do not believe him and ve ##hem ##ently resist his efforts to free them so they can see for themselves ( 51 ##6 ##e – 51 ##8 ##a ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this all ##ego ##ry is , on a basic level , about a philosopher who upon finding greater knowledge outside the cave of human understanding , seeks to share it as is his duty , and the foolish ##ness of those who would ignore him because they think themselves educated enough . [SEP]
[CLS] in late antiquity martian ##us cape ##lla organized all the information a fifth - century upper - class male needed to know into an all ##ego ##ry of the wedding of mercury and " phil ##olo ##gia , " with the seven liberal arts the young man needed to know as guests . [SEP]
[CLS] other early all ##ego ##ries are found in the hebrew bible , such as the extended metaphor in psalm 80 of the vine and its impressive spread and growth , representing israel ' s conquest and pe ##op ##ling of the promised land . [SEP]
[CLS] also all ##egorical is ezekiel 16 and 17 , wherein the capture of that same vine by the mighty eagle represents israel ' s exile to babylon . [SEP]
[CLS] all ##egorical interpretation of the bible was a common early christian practice and continues . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the recently re - discovered iv ##th commentary on the gospels by fort ##una ##tian ##us of a ##quil ##eia has a comment by its english translator : " the principal characteristic of fort ##una ##tian ##us ’ ex ##ege ##sis is a figurative approach , relying on a set of concepts associated with key terms in order to create an all ##egorical deco ##ding of the text . " [SEP]
[CLS] all ##ego ##ry has an ability to freeze the temporal ##ity of a story , while in ##fus ##ing it with a spiritual context . [SEP]
[CLS] media ##eva ##l thinking accepted all ##ego ##ry as having a " reality " underlying any rhetoric ##al or fictional uses . [SEP]
[CLS] the all ##ego ##ry was as true as the facts of surface appearances . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the papal bull " una ##m san ##cta ##m " ( 130 ##2 ) presents themes of the unity of christ ##end ##om with the pope as its head in which the all ##egorical details of the metaphor ##s are add ##uce ##d as facts on which is based a demonstration with the vocabulary of logic : " " therefore " of this one and only church there is one body and one head — not two heads as if it were a monster . . . if , then , the greeks or others say that they were not committed to the care of peter and his successors , they " necessarily " confess that they are not of the sheep of christ . " [SEP]
[CLS] this text also demonstrates the frequent use of all ##ego ##ry in religious texts during the media ##eva ##l period , following the tradition and example of the bible . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late 15th century , the enigma ##tic " h ##yp ##ner ##oto ##mac ##hia " , with its elaborate wood ##cut illustrations , shows the influence of themed pageant ##s and mas ##ques on contemporary all ##egorical representation , as humanist dialect ##ic conveyed them . [SEP]
[CLS] the denial of medieval all ##ego ##ry as found in the 12th - century works of hugh of st victor and edward tops ##ell ' s " his ##tori ##e of four ##e - footed beast ##es " ( london , 160 ##7 , 1653 ) and its replacement in the study of nature with methods of cat ##ego ##ris ##ation and mathematics by such figures as naturalist john ray and the astronomer galileo is thought to mark the beginnings of early modern science . [SEP]
[CLS] since meaningful stories are nearly always applicable to larger issues , all ##ego ##ries may be read into many stories which the author may not have recognised . [SEP]
[CLS] this is all ##ego ##res ##is , or the act of reading a story as an all ##ego ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] examples of all ##ego ##ry in popular culture that may or may not have been intended include the works of bert ##olt br ##ech ##t , and even some works of science fiction and fantasy , such as " the chronicles of na ##rn ##ia " by c . s . lewis and " a kingdom far and clear : the complete swan lake trilogy " by mark help ##rin . [SEP]
[CLS] the story of the apple falling onto isaac newton ' s head is another famous all ##ego ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] it simplified the idea of gravity by depicting a simple way it was supposedly discovered . [SEP]
[CLS] it also made the scientific revelation well known by conde ##ns ##ing the theory into a short tale . [SEP]
[CLS] it is important to note that while all ##ego ##res ##is may make discovery of all ##ego ##ry in any work , not every res ##ona ##nt work of modern fiction is all ##egorical , and some are clearly not intended to be viewed this way . [SEP]
[CLS] according to henry little ##field ' s 1964 article , l . frank ba ##um ' s " the wonderful wizard of oz " , may be readily understood as a plot - driven fantasy narrative in an extended fable with talking animals and broadly sketch ##ed characters , intended to discuss the politics of the time . [SEP]
[CLS] yet , george macdonald emphasis ##ed in 1893 that " a fairy tale is not an all ##ego ##ry . " [SEP]
[CLS] j . r . r . tolkien ' s " the lord of the rings " is another example of a well - known work mistakenly perceived as all ##egorical , as the author himself once stated , " . . . i cord ##ial ##ly dislike all ##ego ##ry in all its manifestation ##s , and always have done so since i grew old and wary enough to detect its presence . [SEP]
[CLS] i much prefer history – true or fei ##gned – with its varied app ##lica ##bility to the thought and experience of readers . [SEP]
[CLS] i think that many confuse app ##lica ##bility with all ##ego ##ry , but the one resides in the freedom of the reader , and the other in the purpose ##d domination of the author . " [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien specifically resented the suggestion that the book ' s one ring , which gives overwhelming power to those possessing it , was intended as an all ##ego ##ry of nuclear weapons . [SEP]
[CLS] he noted that , had that been his intention , the book would not have ended with the ring being destroyed but rather with an arms race in which various powers would try to obtain such a ring for themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] then tolkien went on to outline an alternative plot for " lord of the rings " , as it would have been written had such an all ##ego ##ry been intended , and which would have made the book into a d ##yst ##op ##ia . [SEP]
[CLS] while all this does not mean tolkien ' s works may not be treated as having all ##egorical themes , especially when rein ##ter ##pre ##ted through post ##mo ##dern sen ##si ##bilities , it at least suggests that none were conscious in his writings . [SEP]
[CLS] this further reinforce ##s the idea of forced all ##ego ##res ##is , as all ##ego ##ry is often a matter of interpretation and only sometimes of original artistic intention . [SEP]
[CLS] like all ##egorical stories , all ##egorical poetry has two meanings – a literal meaning and a symbolic meaning . [SEP]
