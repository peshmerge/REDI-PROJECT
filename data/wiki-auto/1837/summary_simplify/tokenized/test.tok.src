[CLS] as a literary device , an all ##ego ##ry is a metaphor in which a character , place or event is used to deliver a broader message about real - world issues and occurrences . [SEP]
[CLS] all ##ego ##ry ( in the sense of the practice and use of all ##egorical devices and works ) has occurred widely throughout history in all forms of art , largely because it can readily illustrate or convey complex ideas and concepts in ways that are com ##pre ##hen ##sible or striking to its viewers , readers , or listeners . [SEP]
[CLS] writers or speakers typically use all ##ego ##ries as literary devices or as rhetoric ##al devices that convey ( semi - ) hidden or complex meanings through symbolic figures , actions , imagery , or events , which together create the moral , spiritual , or political meaning the author wishes to convey . [SEP]
[CLS] north ##rop fry ##e discussed what he termed a " continuum of all ##ego ##ry " , a spectrum that ranges from what he termed the " naive all ##ego ##ry " of " the faerie queen ##e " , to the more private all ##ego ##ries of modern paradox literature . [SEP]
[CLS] in this perspective , the characters in a " naive " all ##ego ##ry are not fully three - dimensional , for each aspect of their individual personalities and the events that be ##fall them em ##bo ##dies some moral quality or other abstraction ; the all ##ego ##ry has been selected first , and the details merely flesh it out . [SEP]
[CLS] the origins of all ##ego ##ry can be traced at least back to homer in his " quasi - all ##egorical " use of person ##ification ##s of , e . g . , terror ( dei ##mos ) and fear ( ph ##ob ##os ) at il . [SEP]
[CLS] 11 die ##ls - k ##ran ##z ) , the ##age ##nes proposed symbolic interpretations whereby the gods of the il ##iad actually stood for physical elements . [SEP]
[CLS] some scholars , however , argue that ph ##ere ##cy ##des co ##smo ##gon ##ic writings anticipated the ##age ##nes all ##egorical work , illustrated especially by his early placement of time ( ch ##ron ##os ) in his genealogy of the gods , which is thought to be a rein ##ter ##pre ##tation of the titan k ##ron ##os , from more traditional gene ##alo ##gies . [SEP]
[CLS] in classical literature two of the best - known all ##ego ##ries are the cave in plato ' s " republic " ( book vii ) and the story of the stomach and its members in the speech of men ##eni ##us ag ##rip ##pa ( liv ##y ii . [SEP]
[CLS] among the best - known examples of all ##ego ##ry , plato ' s all ##ego ##ry of the cave , forms a part of his larger work " the republic . " [SEP]
[CLS] according to the all ##ego ##ry , the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality , until one of them finds his way into the outside world where he sees the actual objects that produced the shadows . [SEP]
[CLS] in late antiquity martian ##us cape ##lla organized all the information a fifth - century upper - class male needed to know into an all ##ego ##ry of the wedding of mercury and " phil ##olo ##gia , " with the seven liberal arts the young man needed to know as guests . [SEP]
[CLS] other early all ##ego ##ries are found in the hebrew bible , such as the extended metaphor in psalm 80 of the vine and its impressive spread and growth , representing israel ' s conquest and pe ##op ##ling of the promised land . [SEP]
[CLS] also all ##egorical is ezekiel 16 and 17 , wherein the capture of that same vine by the mighty eagle represents israel ' s exile to babylon . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the recently re - discovered iv ##th commentary on the gospels by fort ##una ##tian ##us of a ##quil ##eia has a comment by its english translator : " the principal characteristic of fort ##una ##tian ##us ’ ex ##ege ##sis is a figurative approach , relying on a set of concepts associated with key terms in order to create an all ##egorical deco ##ding of the text . " [SEP]
[CLS] all ##ego ##ry has an ability to freeze the temporal ##ity of a story , while in ##fus ##ing it with a spiritual context . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the papal bull " una ##m san ##cta ##m " ( 130 ##2 ) presents themes of the unity of christ ##end ##om with the pope as its head in which the all ##egorical details of the metaphor ##s are add ##uce ##d as facts on which is based a demonstration with the vocabulary of logic : " " therefore " of this one and only church there is one body and one head — not two heads as if it were a monster . . . [SEP]
[CLS] this text also demonstrates the frequent use of all ##ego ##ry in religious texts during the media ##eva ##l period , following the tradition and example of the bible . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late 15th century , the enigma ##tic " h ##yp ##ner ##oto ##mac ##hia " , with its elaborate wood ##cut illustrations , shows the influence of themed pageant ##s and mas ##ques on contemporary all ##egorical representation , as humanist dialect ##ic conveyed them . [SEP]
[CLS] the denial of medieval all ##ego ##ry as found in the 12th - century works of hugh of st victor and edward tops ##ell ' s " his ##tori ##e of four ##e - footed beast ##es " ( london , 160 ##7 , 1653 ) and its replacement in the study of nature with methods of cat ##ego ##ris ##ation and mathematics by such figures as naturalist john ray and the astronomer galileo is thought to mark the beginnings of early modern science . [SEP]
[CLS] since meaningful stories are nearly always applicable to larger issues , all ##ego ##ries may be read into many stories which the author may not have recognised . [SEP]
[CLS] examples of all ##ego ##ry in popular culture that may or may not have been intended include the works of bert ##olt br ##ech ##t , and even some works of science fiction and fantasy , such as " the chronicles of na ##rn ##ia " by c . s . [SEP]
[CLS] the story of the apple falling onto isaac newton ' s head is another famous all ##ego ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] it is important to note that while all ##ego ##res ##is may make discovery of all ##ego ##ry in any work , not every res ##ona ##nt work of modern fiction is all ##egorical , and some are clearly not intended to be viewed this way . [SEP]
[CLS] according to henry little ##field ' s 1964 article , l . frank ba ##um ' s " the wonderful wizard of oz " , may be readily understood as a plot - driven fantasy narrative in an extended fable with talking animals and broadly sketch ##ed characters , intended to discuss the politics of the time . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien ' s " the lord of the rings " is another example of a well - known work mistakenly perceived as all ##egorical , as the author himself once stated , " . . . i cord ##ial ##ly dislike all ##ego ##ry in all its manifestation ##s , and always have done so since i grew old and wary enough to detect its presence . [SEP]
[CLS] i think that many confuse app ##lica ##bility with all ##ego ##ry , but the one resides in the freedom of the reader , and the other in the purpose ##d domination of the author . " [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien specifically resented the suggestion that the book ' s one ring , which gives overwhelming power to those possessing it , was intended as an all ##ego ##ry of nuclear weapons . [SEP]
[CLS] while all this does not mean tolkien ' s works may not be treated as having all ##egorical themes , especially when rein ##ter ##pre ##ted through post ##mo ##dern sen ##si ##bilities , it at least suggests that none were conscious in his writings . [SEP]
[CLS] this further reinforce ##s the idea of forced all ##ego ##res ##is , as all ##ego ##ry is often a matter of interpretation and only sometimes of original artistic intention . [SEP]
