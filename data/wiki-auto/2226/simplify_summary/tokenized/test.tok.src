[CLS] ad ho ##mine ##m ( latin for " to the person " ) , short for argument ##um ad ho ##mine ##m , typically refers to a fall ##acious argument ##ative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character , motive , or other attribute of the person making the argument , or persons associated with the argument , rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself . [SEP]
[CLS] the terms " ad mu ##lier ##em " and " ad fe ##mina ##m " have been used specifically when the person receiving the criticism is female . [SEP]
[CLS] fall ##acious " ad ho ##mine ##m " reasoning is categorized among informal fall ##acies , more precisely as a genetic fall ##acy , a sub ##cate ##gor ##y of fall ##acies of ir ##rel ##eva ##nce . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the term ' s original meaning was an argument " calculated to appeal to the person addressed more than to imp ##art ##ial reason " . [SEP]
[CLS] under this meaning the term does not refer to a logical fall ##acy . [SEP]
[CLS] this meaning survives in philosophical usage , as explained by the philosopher r . scott ba ##kker : " classical p ##yr ##rh ##onia ##ns argued ad ho ##mine ##m , not in the sense of the logical fall ##acy of that name , but in the sense that their dialect ##ical strategy nec ##ess ##itate ##s the exclusive utilization of the beliefs , convictions , and assumptions of their inter ##lo ##cut ##ors . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , they construct their arguments on the basis of what other people hold to be true . " [SEP]
[CLS] " ad ho ##mine ##m tu quo ##que " ( literally : " you also " ) refers to a claim that the source making the argument has spoken or acted in a way inconsistent with the argument . [SEP]
[CLS] in particular , if source a critic ##izes the actions of source b , a " tu quo ##que " response is that source a has acted in the same way . [SEP]
[CLS] this argument is invalid because it does not di ##sp ##rove the premise ; if the premise is true then source a may be a h ##yp ##oc ##rite , but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , source a may be in a position to provide personal testimony to support the argument . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , a father may tell the son not to start smoking as he will regret it when he is older , and the son may point out that his father is or was a smoke ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] this does not alter the fact that his son may regret smoking when he is older . [SEP]
[CLS] " ci ##rc ##ums ##tan ##tial ad ho ##mine ##m " points out that someone is in circumstances such that they are disposed to take a particular position . [SEP]
[CLS] it constitutes an attack on the bias of a source . [SEP]
[CLS] this is fall ##acious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid ; this overlap ##s with the genetic fall ##acy ( an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the ci ##rc ##ums ##tan ##tial fall ##acy does not apply where the source is taking a position by using a logical argument based solely on premises that are generally accepted . [SEP]
[CLS] where the source seeks to convince an audience of the truth of a premise by a claim of authority or by personal observation , observation of their circumstances may reduce the evident ##iary weight of the claims , sometimes to zero . [SEP]
[CLS] guilt by association can sometimes also be a type of " ad ho ##mine ##m " fall ##acy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument . [SEP]
[CLS] an example of this fall ##acy could be " my opponent for office just received an endorsement from the puppy hate ##rs association . [SEP]
[CLS] is that the sort of person you would want to vote for ? " [SEP]
[CLS] in philosophical usage " ad ho ##mine ##m " may refer to a dialect ##ical strategy involving the exclusive utilization of the beliefs , convictions , and assumptions of those holding the position being argued against , i . e . , arguments constructed on the basis of what other people hold to be true . [SEP]
[CLS] when a statement is challenged by making an " ad ho ##mine ##m " attack on its author , it is important to draw a distinction between whether the statement in question was " an argument " or " a statement of fact " ( " testimony " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the latter case the issues of the credibility of the person making the statement may be crucial . [SEP]
[CLS] it should also be noted that an ad ho ##mine ##m fall ##acy occurs when one attacks the character of an inter ##lo ##cut ##or in an attempt to ref ##ute their argument . [SEP]
[CLS] insulting someone is not necessarily an instance of an ad ho ##mine ##m fall ##acy . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , if one supplies sufficient reasons to reject an inter ##lo ##cut ##or ' s argument and adds a slight character attack at the end , this character attack is not necessarily fall ##acious . [SEP]
[CLS] whether it is fall ##acious depends on whether or not the insult is used as a reason against the inter ##lo ##cut ##or ' s argument . [SEP]
[CLS] an ad ho ##mine ##m occurs when an attack on the inter ##lo ##cut ##or ' s character functions as a response to an inter ##lo ##cut ##or ' s argument / claim . [SEP]
[CLS] canadian academic and the author known as doug walton has argued that " ad ho ##mine ##m " reasoning is not always fall ##acious , and that in some instances , questions of personal conduct , character , motives , etc . , are legitimate and relevant to the issue , as when it directly involves h ##yp ##oc ##ris ##y , or actions contra ##dict ##ing the subject ' s words . [SEP]
[CLS] the philosopher charles taylor has argued that " ad ho ##mine ##m " reasoning ( discussing facts about the speaker or author relative to the value of his statements ) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality ( or moral claims ) , and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the ap ##od ##ic ##tic reasoning ( involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established ) of philosophical natural ##ism .
