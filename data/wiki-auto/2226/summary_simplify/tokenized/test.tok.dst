[CLS] ad ho ##mine ##m ( latin for " to the person " ) , short for argument ##um ad ho ##mine ##m , typically refers to a fall ##acious argument ##ative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character , motive , or other attribute of the person making the argument , or persons associated with the argument , rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the term ' s original meaning was an argument " calculated to appeal to the person addressed more than to imp ##art ##ial reason " . [SEP]
[CLS] under this meaning the term does not refer to a logical fall ##acy . [SEP]
[CLS] this meaning survives in philosophical usage , as explained by the philosopher r . scott ba ##kker : " classical p ##yr ##rh ##onia ##ns argued ad ho ##mine ##m , not in the sense of the logical fall ##acy of that name , but in the sense that their dialect ##ical strategy nec ##ess ##itate ##s the exclusive utilization of the beliefs , convictions , and assumptions of their inter ##lo ##cut ##ors . [SEP]
[CLS] " ad ho ##mine ##m tu quo ##que " ( literally : " you also " ) refers to a claim that the source making the argument has spoken or acted in a way inconsistent with the argument . [SEP]
[CLS] this is fall ##acious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid ; this overlap ##s with the genetic fall ##acy ( an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the ci ##rc ##ums ##tan ##tial fall ##acy does not apply where the source is taking a position by using a logical argument based solely on premises that are generally accepted . [SEP]
[CLS] where the source seeks to convince an audience of the truth of a premise by a claim of authority or by personal observation , observation of their circumstances may reduce the evident ##iary weight of the claims , sometimes to zero . [SEP]
[CLS] guilt by association can sometimes also be a type of " ad ho ##mine ##m " fall ##acy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument . [SEP]
[CLS] in philosophical usage " ad ho ##mine ##m " may refer to a dialect ##ical strategy involving the exclusive utilization of the beliefs , convictions , and assumptions of those holding the position being argued against , i . e . , arguments constructed on the basis of what other people hold to be true . [SEP]
[CLS] in the latter case the issues of the credibility of the person making the statement may be crucial . [SEP]
[CLS] it should also be noted that an ad ho ##mine ##m fall ##acy occurs when one attacks the character of an inter ##lo ##cut ##or in an attempt to ref ##ute their argument . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , if one supplies sufficient reasons to reject an inter ##lo ##cut ##or ' s argument and adds a slight character attack at the end , this character attack is not necessarily fall ##acious . [SEP]
[CLS] whether it is fall ##acious depends on whether or not the insult is used as a reason against the inter ##lo ##cut ##or ' s argument . [SEP]
[CLS] canadian academic and the author known as doug walton has argued that " ad ho ##mine ##m " reasoning is not always fall ##acious , and that in some instances , questions of personal conduct , character , motives , etc . , are legitimate and relevant to the issue , as when it directly involves h ##yp ##oc ##ris ##y , or actions contra ##dict ##ing the subject ' s words . [SEP]
[CLS] the philosopher charles taylor has argued that " ad ho ##mine ##m " reasoning ( discussing facts about the speaker or author relative to the value of his statements ) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality ( or moral claims ) , and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the ap ##od ##ic ##tic reasoning ( involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established ) of philosophical natural ##ism .
