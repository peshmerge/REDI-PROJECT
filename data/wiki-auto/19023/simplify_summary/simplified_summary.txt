most of the land area of the island lies to the south and west of the lagoon .

because of this topography , the ocean could be seen from much of malden 's interior .
the island is largely covered in " sida fallax " scrub , low herbs and grasses .
introduced weeds , including the low growing woody vine " tribulus cistoides " , now dominate extensive open areas , providing more cover for young sooty terns .

the island was named after charles robert malden , the first european to see the island .
andrew bloxam , naturalist of the " blonde " , and james macrae , a botanist travelling for the royal horticultural society , joined in exploring the island and recorded their observations .
malden was the island was first sighted by william clark in 1823 .
at the time of its discovery , the island was uninhabited , but the remains of ruined temples and other structures indicated that the island had been inhabited .
in 1924 , the malden ruins were looked at by an archaeologist from the bishop museum in honolulu , who concluded that they were the creation of a small polynesian population which had resided there for several generations earlier .
the ancient stone structures are located around the beach ridges , mostly on the north and south sides .
in the first half of the nineteenth century , during the heyday of american whaling in the central pacific , malden was visited on a number of occasions by whalers .
malden was claimed by the u . s . guano company under the guano islands act of 1856 .
before the american company could start their operations , the island was owned by an australian company under british licence .
this company and its successors exploited the island continuously from the 1860s through 1927 .
writer beatrice grimshaw , a visitor to malden in the guano-digging era , decried the " breuning barrenness of the bit island " , declaring that " . . shade , coolness , refreshing fruit , pleasant sights and sounds : there are none .
for those who live on the island , it is the scene of an exile which has to be endured somehow or other " .
she described malden as having " a little settlement fronted by a big wooden pier , and a plain of low greyish-green herbage , relieved here and there by small bushes bearing insignificant yellow flowers " .
fresh water wells could be dug on the island .
the five or six european supervisors on the island were given " a row of little tin-roofed , one-storeyed houses above the beach " .
grimshaw described these buildings as being " large , bare , shady buildings fitted with wide shelves , on which the men spread their mats and pillows to sleep " .
indentured labourers on malden were contracted for one year , paid ten shillings per week plus room and board , and repatriated to their home islands when their contracts expired .
at the end of the day , the sails were unfurled , and the train cars whisked back to the settlement by the current southeastern winds .
while cars were known to jump the tracks more than once during these trips , the system seems to have worked fairly well .
this tramway remained in use on malden as late as 1924 .
although guano digging continued on malden through the early 1920s , all human activity on the island had ceased by the early 1930s .
there were no more human use until 1956 .

the three thermonuclear devices were detonated at high altitude a short distance offshore in 1957 .
the airstrip was constructed on the island by the royal engineers in 1956 – 57 remained usable in july 1979 .
malden was made into a part of the british gilbert and ellice islands colony in 1972 .
the u . s . continued to dispute british sovereignty , based on its nineteenth century guano act claims , until after kiribati became independent .
on 20 september 1979 , representatives of the united states and kiribati met on tarawa atoll in the gilberts group of kiribati .
it was signed in 1983 .
the main value of the island to kiribati is in the resources of the 200 nmi exclusive economic zone which surrounds it , particularly the rich tuna fisheries .
gypsum deposits on the island itself are extensive , but do not appear to be viable under foreseeable market conditions , mainly due to cost of transportation .
some revenue has been realized from ecotourism ; the " world discoverer " , an adventure cruise ship operated by " society expeditions " , visited the island once or twice a year for several years in the mid-1990s .
malden was reserved as a wildlife sanctuary and closed area , and was officially designated as the " malden island wildlife sanctuary " , on 29 may 1975 , under the 1975 wildlife conservation ordinance .
this sanctuary is administered by the wildlife conservation unit of the ministry of line and phoenix islands development , headquartered on kiritimati .
