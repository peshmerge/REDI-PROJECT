[CLS] mal ##den island , sometimes called independence island in the nineteenth century , is a low , arid , uninhabited atoll in the central pacific ocean , about 39 km ##2 in area . [SEP]
[CLS] it is one of the line islands belonging to the republic of ki ##ri ##bat ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] the lagoon is entirely enclosed by land , however it is connected to the sea by underground channels , and is quite salty . [SEP]
[CLS] the island is chiefly notable for its mysterious prehistoric ruins , its once - extensive deposits of ph ##os ##pha ##tic gu ##ano ( exploited by australian interests from 1860 – 1927 ) , its former use as the site of the first british h - bomb tests ( operation gr ##apple , 1957 ) , and its current importance as a protected area for breeding sea ##birds . [SEP]
[CLS] the island is designated as the " mal ##den island wildlife sanctuary " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2014 the ki ##ri ##bat ##i government established a 12 nmi fishing exclusion zone around each of the southern line islands ( caroline ( commonly called millennium ) , flint , vo ##sto ##k , mal ##den , and star ##buck ) . [SEP]
[CLS] mal ##den island is located 242 nmi south of the equator , 153 ##0 nmi south of honolulu , hawaii , and more than 4000 nmi west of the coast of south america . [SEP]
[CLS] the nearest land is uninhabited star ##buck island , 110 nmi to the southwest . [SEP]
[CLS] the closest inhabited place is tonga ##re ##va ( pen ##rh ##yn island ) , 243 nmi to the southwest . [SEP]
[CLS] the nearest airport is on ki ##rit ##ima ##ti ( christmas island ) , 365 nmi to the northwest . [SEP]
[CLS] other nearby islands ( all uninhabited ) include jarvis island , 37 ##3 nmi to the northwest , vo ##sto ##k island , 385 nmi to the south - southeast , and caroline ( millennium ) island , 460 nmi to the southeast . [SEP]
[CLS] the island has roughly the shape of an e ##quil ##ater ##al triangle , with 8 km on a side , aligned with the southwest side running northwest to southeast . [SEP]
[CLS] the west and south corners are slightly truncated , short ##ening the north , east and southwest coasts to about 7 km , and adding shorter west and south coasts about 1 to 2 km ( 1 ##⁄ ##2 – 1 mi ) in length . [SEP]
[CLS] a large , mostly shallow , irregular ##ly shaped lagoon , containing a number of small isle ##ts , fills the east central part of the island . [SEP]
[CLS] the lagoon is entirely enclosed by land , but only by relatively narrow strips along its north and east sides . [SEP]
[CLS] it is connected to the sea by underground channels , and is quite salty . [SEP]
[CLS] most of the land area of the island lies to the south and west of the lagoon . [SEP]
[CLS] the total area of the island is about 39 . 3 km ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the island is very low , no more than 10 m above sea level at its highest point . [SEP]
[CLS] the highest elevations are found along a rim that closely follows the coastline . [SEP]
[CLS] the interior forms a depression that is only a few meters above sea level in the western part and is below sea level ( filled by the lagoon ) in the east central part . [SEP]
[CLS] because of this topography , the ocean cannot be seen from much of mal ##den ' s interior . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no standing fresh water on mal ##den island , though a fresh water lens may exist . [SEP]
[CLS] a continuous heavy surf falls all along the coast , forming a narrow white to gray sandy beach . [SEP]
[CLS] except on the west coast , where the white sandy beach is more extensive than elsewhere , a strip of dark gray coral rubble , forming a series of low ridges parallel to the coast , lies within the narrow beach , extending inward to the island rim . [SEP]
[CLS] because of mal ##den ' s isolation and arid ##ity , its vegetation is extremely limited . [SEP]
[CLS] sixteen species of vascular plants have been recorded , of which nine are indigenous . [SEP]
[CLS] the island is largely covered in stunt ##ed " sid ##a fall ##ax " scrub , low herbs and grasses . [SEP]
[CLS] few , if any , of the cl ##ump ##s of stunt ##ed " pi ##son ##ia grand ##is " once found on the island still survive . [SEP]
[CLS] coconut palms planted by the gu ##ano digger ##s did not thrive , although a few dilapidated trees may still be seen . [SEP]
[CLS] introduced weeds , including the low - growing woody vine " tri ##bu ##lus cis ##to ##ides " , now dominate extensive open areas , providing increased cover for young soo ##ty ter ##ns . [SEP]
[CLS] mal ##den is an important breeding island for about a dozen species including masked boo ##bies ( " sul ##a da ##ct ##yla ##tra " ) , red - footed boo ##by ( " sul ##a sul ##a " ) , tr ##op ##ic ##birds ( " ph ##ae ##th ##ont ##idae " ) , great frigate ##bird ( " fr ##ega ##ta minor " ) , lesser frigate ##bird ( " fr ##ega ##ta ariel " ) , grey - backed ter ##n ( " on ##ych ##op ##rion luna ##ta " ) , red - tailed tr ##op ##ic ##bird ( " ph ##ae ##th ##on rub ##rica ##uda " ) , soo ##ty ter ##ns ( " stern ##a fu ##sca ##ta " ) it is also an important winter - stop for the br ##istle - thigh ##ed curl ##ew ( " nu ##men ##ius ta ##hiti ##ensis " ) , a migrant from alaska ; and other migratory sea ##birds ( nineteen species in all ) . [SEP]
[CLS] two kinds of lizards , the mourning ge ##cko ( " le ##pid ##oda ##ct ##ylus lu ##gu ##bri ##s " ) and snake - eyed skin ##k ( " crypt ##ob ##le ##pha ##rus bout ##oni ##i " ) are present on mal ##den , together with brown libel ##lu ##lid dragon ##fly . [SEP]
[CLS] cats , pigs , goats and house mice were introduced to mal ##den during the gu ##ano - digging period . [SEP]
[CLS] while the goats and pigs have all died off , feral cats and house mice are still present . [SEP]
[CLS] small numbers of green turtles nest on the beaches , and hermit crabs ab ##ound . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest documented western sighting of mal ##den island was on 25 march 1825 , by captain samuel bunker ( 1796 - 1874 ) of the american whale ##r " alexander " . [SEP]
[CLS] on 30 july , 1825 , the island was seen again by captain the 7th lord byron ( a cousin of the famous poet ) . [SEP]
[CLS] byron , commanding the british warship hms " blonde " , was returning to london from a special mission to honolulu to rep ##at ##ria ##te the remains of the young king and queen of hawaii , who had died of me ##as ##les during a visit to britain . [SEP]
[CLS] the island was named after lt . charles robert mal ##den , navigator of the " blonde " , who sighted the island and briefly explored it . [SEP]
[CLS] andrew b ##lo ##xa ##m , naturalist of the " blonde " , and james mac ##rae , a botanist travelling for the royal horticultural society , joined in exploring the island and recorded their observations . [SEP]
[CLS] mal ##den may have been the island sighted by another whaling captain william clark in 1823 , aboard the " winslow " . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time of its discovery by europeans , mal ##den was found to be uno ##cc ##up ##ied , but the remains of ruined temples and other structures indicated that the island had at one time been inhabited . [SEP]
[CLS] at various times these remains have been speculative ##ly attributed to " wrecked seamen " , " buccaneers " , " south american inca ##s " , " early chinese navigator ##s " , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1924 , the mal ##den ruins were examined by an archaeologist from the bishop museum in honolulu , kenneth emory , who concluded that they were the creation of a small poly ##nesian population which had resided there for perhaps several generations some centuries earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] the ancient stone structures are located around the beach ridges , principally on the north and south sides . [SEP]
[CLS] a total of 21 archaeological sites have been discovered , three of which ( on the island ' s northwest side ) are larger than the others . [SEP]
[CLS] these sites include temple platforms , called mara ##e , house sites , and graves . [SEP]
[CLS] comparisons with stone structures on tu ##amo ##tu atoll ##s show that a population of between 100 and 200 natives could have produced all of the mal ##den structures . [SEP]
[CLS] mara ##es of a similar type are found on rai ##va ##va ##e , one of the aus ##tral islands . [SEP]
[CLS] various wells used by these ancient ##s were found by later settlers to be dry or bra ##cki ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] in the first half of the nineteenth century , during the hey ##day of american whaling in the central pacific , mal ##den was visited on a number of occasions by american whale ##rs . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1918 , schooner " annie larsen " , infamous for her role in the hindu - german conspiracy , was stranded at mal ##den island . [SEP]
[CLS] mal ##den was claimed by the u . s . gu ##ano company under the gu ##ano islands act of 1856 , which authorized citizens to take possession of uninhabited islands under the authority of the united states for the purpose of removing gu ##ano , a valuable agricultural fe ##rti ##lizer . [SEP]
[CLS] before the american company could begin their operations , the island was occupied by an australian company under british licence . [SEP]
[CLS] this company and its successors exploited the island continuously from the 1860s through 1927 . [SEP]
[CLS] writer beatrice grim ##shaw , a visitor to mal ##den in the gu ##ano - digging era , dec ##ried the " glaring barren ##ness of the bit island " , declaring that " . . . shade , cool ##ness , refreshing fruit , pleasant sights and sounds : there are none . [SEP]
[CLS] for those who live on the island , it is the scene of an exile which has to be endured somehow or other " . [SEP]
[CLS] she described mal ##den as containing " a little settlement fronted by a big wooden pier , and a des ##olate plain of low greyish - green herb ##age , relieved here and there by small bushes bearing insignificant yellow flowers " . [SEP]
[CLS] water for settlers was produced by large di ##sti ##llation plants , since no fresh - water wells could be successfully dug on the island . [SEP]
[CLS] the five or six european supervisors on the island were given " a row of little tin - roofed , one - storey ##ed houses above the beach " , while the native labourers from ni ##ue island and ai ##tu ##ta ##ki were housed in " big , barn - like shelters " . [SEP]
[CLS] grim ##shaw described these ed ##ifice ##s as being " large , bare , shady buildings fitted with wide shelves , on which the men spread their mats and pillows to sleep " . [SEP]
[CLS] their food consisted of " rice , biscuits , ya ##ms , tin ##ned beef , and tea , with a few cocoa ##nut ##s for those who may fall sick " . [SEP]
[CLS] food for the white supervisors consisted of " tin ##ned food of various kinds , also bread , rice , f ##ow ##ls , pork , goat , and goat ' s milk " , but vegetables were hard to come by . [SEP]
[CLS] ind ##ent ##ured labourers on mal ##den were contracted for one year , paid ten shillings per week plus room and board , and rep ##at ##riated to their home islands when their contracts expired . [SEP]
[CLS] salaries for the supervisors were described as " quite high " . [SEP]
[CLS] work hours were 5 am to 5 pm , with one hour and 45 minutes given off for meals . [SEP]
[CLS] the gu ##ano digger ##s constructed a unique railroad on mal ##den island , with cars powered by large sails . [SEP]
[CLS] laborers pushed empty carts from the loading area up the tramway to the digging pits , where they were then loaded with gu ##ano . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of the day , the sails were un ##fur ##led , and the train cars w ##his ##ked back to the settlement by the prevailing southeastern winds . [SEP]
[CLS] while cars were known to jump the tracks more than once during these excursion ##s , the system seems to have worked fairly well . [SEP]
[CLS] railroad hand ##cars were also used . [SEP]
[CLS] this tramway remained in use on mal ##den as late as 1924 , and its road ##bed still exists on the island today . [SEP]
[CLS] although gu ##ano digging continued on mal ##den through the early 1920s , all human activity on the island had ceased by the early 1930s . [SEP]
[CLS] no further human use seems to have been made of mal ##den until 1956 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1956 the united kingdom selected mal ##den as the " instrumentation site " for its first series of the ##rm ##on ##uc ##lea ##r ( h - bomb ) weapons tests , based at ki ##rit ##ima ##ti ( christmas island ) . [SEP]
[CLS] british officials insisted that mal ##den should not be called a " target island " . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , the bombing target marker was located at the south point of the island and three the ##rm ##on ##uc ##lea ##r devices were detonated at high altitude a short distance offshore in 1957 . [SEP]
[CLS] the airs ##trip constructed on the island by the royal engineers in 1956 – 57 remained usable in july 1979 . [SEP]
[CLS] mal ##den was incorporated in the british gilbert and el ##lice islands colony in 1972 , and included in the portion of the colony which became the republic of ki ##ri ##bat ##i in 1979 . [SEP]
[CLS] the u . s . continued to dispute british sovereignty , based on its nineteenth century gu ##ano act claims , until after ki ##ri ##bat ##i became independent . [SEP]
[CLS] on 20 september 1979 , representatives of the united states and ki ##ri ##bat ##i met on tara ##wa atoll in the gilbert ##s group of ki ##ri ##bat ##i , and signed a treaty of friendship between their two nations ( commonly referred to as the treaty of tara ##wa of 1979 ) by which the united states recognized ki ##ri ##bat ##i ' s sovereignty over mal ##den and thirteen other islands in the line and phoenix islands groups . [SEP]
[CLS] this treaty entered into force on 23 september 1983 . [SEP]
[CLS] the main value of the island to ki ##ri ##bat ##i lies in the resources of the 200 nmi exclusive economic zone which surrounds it , particularly the rich tuna fisheries . [SEP]
[CLS] g ##yp ##sum deposits on the island itself are extensive , but do not appear to be economically viable under fore ##see ##able market conditions , mainly due to cost of transportation . [SEP]
[CLS] some revenue has been realized from eco ##tour ##ism ; the " world discover ##er " , an adventure cruise ship operated by " society expeditions " , visited the island once or twice annually for several years in the mid - 1990s . [SEP]
[CLS] mal ##den was reserved as a wildlife sanctuary and closed area , and was officially designated as the " mal ##den island wildlife sanctuary " , on 29 may 1975 , under the 1975 wildlife conservation ordinance . [SEP]
[CLS] the principal purpose of this reservation was to protect the large breeding populations of sea ##birds . [SEP]
[CLS] this sanctuary is administered by the wildlife conservation unit of the ministry of line and phoenix islands development , headquartered on ki ##rit ##ima ##ti . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no resident staff at mal ##den , however , and occasional visits by foreign yacht ##sm ##en and fishermen cannot be monitored from ki ##rit ##ima ##ti . [SEP]
[CLS] a fire in 1977 , possibly caused by visitors , threatened breeding sea ##birds ; this remains a potential threat , particularly during periods of drought . [SEP]
