in 1924 , the malden ruins were looked at by an archaeologist from the bishop museum in honolulu , who concluded that they were the creation of a small polynesian population which had resided there for several generations earlier .

writer beatrice grimshaw , a visitor to malden in the guano-digging era , decried the " breuning barrenness of the bit island " , declaring that " . . shade , coolness , refreshing fruit , pleasant sights and sounds : there are none .
for those who live on the island , it is the scene of an exile which has to be endured somehow or other " .
she described malden as having " a little settlement fronted by a big wooden pier , and a plain of low greyish-green herbage , relieved here and there by small bushes bearing insignificant yellow flowers " .
the five or six european supervisors on the island were given " a row of little tin-roofed , one-storeyed houses above the beach " .
grimshaw described these buildings as being " large , bare , shady buildings fitted with wide shelves , on which the men spread their mats and pillows to sleep " .
indentured labourers on malden were contracted for one year , paid ten shillings per week plus room and board , and repatriated to their home islands when their contracts expired .

the main value of the island to kiribati is in the resources of the 200 nmi exclusive economic zone which surrounds it , particularly the rich tuna fisheries .
gypsum deposits on the island itself are extensive , but do not appear to be viable under foreseeable market conditions , mainly due to cost of transportation .
