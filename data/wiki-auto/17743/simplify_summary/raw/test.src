West Low German, also known as Low Saxon (German: " ", literally "West Low German", or " " (in a stricter sense), literally: "Low Saxon, Nether-Saxon"; ; ) is a group of Low German (also Low Saxon; German: " ", " ", Dutch: " ") dialects spoken in parts of the Netherlands, northwestern Germany and southern Denmark (in North Schleswig by the German minority).
It is one of two groups of mutually intelligible dialects, the other being East Low German dialects.
A 2005 study found that there were approximately 1.8 million "daily speakers" of Low Saxon in the Netherlands.
The language area comprises the North German states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia (the Westphalian part), Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and Saxony-Anhalt (the northwestern areas around Magdeburg) as well as the northeast of The Netherlands (i.e. Dutch Low Saxon, spoken in Groningen, Drenthe, Overijssel and northern Gelderland) and the Schleswigsch dialect spoken by the North Schleswig Germans in the southernmost part of Denmark.
In the south the Benrath line and Uerdingen line isoglosses form the border with the area, where West Central German variants of High German are spoken.
While Dutch is classified as a Low Franconian language, the Dutch Low Saxon varieties, which are also defined as Dutch dialects, form a dialect continuum with the Westphalian language.
