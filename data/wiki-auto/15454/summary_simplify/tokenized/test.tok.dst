[CLS] it ##ani ##um is a family of 64 - bit intel micro ##pro ##ces ##sor ##s that implement the intel it ##ani ##um architecture ( formerly called ia - 64 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the it ##ani ##um architecture originated at he ##wl ##ett - packard ( hp ) , and was later jointly developed by hp and intel . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 2017 , intel released the current generation , , to test customers , and in may began shipping in volume . [SEP]
[CLS] with epic , the compiler determines in advance which instructions can be executed at the same time , so the micro ##pro ##ces ##sor simply execute ##s the instructions and does not need elaborate mechanisms to determine which instructions to execute in parallel . [SEP]
[CLS] the goal of this approach is two ##fold : to enable deeper inspection of the code at com ##pile time to identify additional opportunities for parallel execution , and to sim ##plify processor design and reduce energy consumption by eliminating the need for run ##time scheduling circuit ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] hp believed that it was no longer cost - effective for individual enterprise systems companies such as itself to develop proprietary micro ##pro ##ces ##sor ##s , so it partnered with intel in 1994 to develop the ia - 64 architecture , derived from epic . [SEP]
[CLS] intel was willing to undertake a very large development effort on ia - 64 in the expectation that the resulting micro ##pro ##ces ##sor would be used by the majority of enterprise systems manufacturers . [SEP]
[CLS] hp and intel initiated a large joint development effort with a goal of delivering the first product , mer ##ced , in 1998 . [SEP]
[CLS] during development , intel , hp , and industry analysts predicted that ia - 64 would dominate in servers , works ##tation ##s , and high - end desktop ##s , and eventually su ##pp ##lan ##t ri ##sc and complex instruction set computing ( cis ##c ) architecture ##s for all general - purpose applications . [SEP]
[CLS] com ##pa ##q and silicon graphics decided to abandon further development of the alpha and mi ##ps architecture ##s respectively in favor of migrating to ia - 64 . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1997 , it was apparent that the ia - 64 architecture and the compiler were much more difficult to implement than originally thought , and the delivery time ##frame of mer ##ced began slipping . [SEP]
[CLS] " it ##ani ##c " has since often been used by " the register " , and others , to imply that the multi ##bill ##ion - dollar investment in it ##ani ##um — and the early h ##ype associated with it — would be followed by its relatively quick demise . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time it ##ani ##um was released in june 2001 , its performance was not superior to competing ri ##sc and cis ##c processors . [SEP]
[CLS] it ##ani ##um competed at the low - end ( primarily four - cpu and smaller systems ) with servers based on x ##86 processors , and at the high - end with ibm power and sun micro ##systems spa ##rc processors . [SEP]
[CLS] intel rep ##osition ##ed it ##ani ##um to focus on high - end business and hp ##c computing , attempting to duplicate x ##86 ' s successful " horizontal " market ( i . e . , single architecture , multiple systems vendors ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the success of this initial processor version was limited to replacing pa - ri ##sc in hp systems , alpha in com ##pa ##q systems and mi ##ps in sg ##i systems , though ibm also delivered a super ##com ##put ##er based on this processor . [SEP]
[CLS] power and spa ##rc remained strong , while the 32 - bit x ##86 architecture continued to grow into the enterprise space , building on economies of scale fueled by its enormous installed base . [SEP]
[CLS] only a few thousand systems using the original " mer ##ced " it ##ani ##um processor were sold , due to relatively poor performance , high cost and limited software availability . [SEP]
[CLS] recognizing that the lack of software could be a serious problem for the future , intel made thousands of these early systems available to independent software vendors ( is ##vs ) to stimulate development . [SEP]
[CLS] hp and intel brought the next - generation it ##ani ##um 2 processor to market a year later . [SEP]
[CLS] the it ##ani ##um 2 processor was released in 2002 , and was marketed for enterprise servers rather than for the whole ga ##mut of high - end computing . [SEP]
[CLS] it relieved many of the performance problems of the original it ##ani ##um processor , which were mostly caused by an in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt memory sub ##sy ##ste ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2003 , am ##d released the opt ##eron cpu , which implements its own 64 - bit architecture called am ##d ##64 . [SEP]
[CLS] under influence by microsoft , intel responded by implementing am ##d ' s x ##86 - 64 instruction set architecture instead of ia - 64 in its x ##eon micro ##pro ##ces ##sor ##s in 2004 , resulting in a new industry - wide " de facto " standard . [SEP]
[CLS] madison used a 130 nm process and was the basis of all new it ##ani ##um processors until monte ##cit ##o was released in june 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] tu ##k ##wil ##a would have four processor cores and would replace the it ##ani ##um bus with a new common system interface , which would also be used by a new x ##eon processor . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 2005 , the major it ##ani ##um server manufacturers joined with intel and a number of software vendors to form the it ##ani ##um solutions alliance to promote the architecture and accelerate software port ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2006 , intel delivered " monte ##cit ##o " ( marketed as the it ##ani ##um 2 900 ##0 series ) , a dual - core processor that roughly doubled performance and decreased energy consumption by about 20 percent . [SEP]
[CLS] the device uses a 65 nm process , includes two to four cores , up to 24 mb on - die cache ##s , hyper - thread ##ing technology and integrated memory controllers . [SEP]
[CLS] with quick ##path , the processor has integrated memory controllers and interfaces the memory directly , using q ##pi interfaces to directly connect to other processors and i / o hub ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] tu ##k ##wil ##a incorporates four memory controllers , each of which supports multiple dd ##r ##3 dim ##ms via a separate memory controller , much like the ne ##hale ##m - based x ##eon processor code - named " beck ##ton " . [SEP]
[CLS] the it ##ani ##um 950 ##0 series processor , code ##name ##d " po ##uls ##on " , is the follow - on processor to tu ##k ##wil ##a and was released on november 8 , 2012 . [SEP]
[CLS] it features eight cores and has a 12 - wide issue architecture , multi ##th ##rea ##ding enhancement ##s , and new instructions to take advantage of parallel ##ism , especially in virtual ##ization . [SEP]
[CLS] given intel ' s history of disc ##los ##ing details about it ##ani ##um micro ##pro ##ces ##sor ##s at iss ##cc , this paper most likely referred to po ##uls ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] analyst david kant ##er speculated that po ##uls ##on would use a new micro ##ar ##chi ##tec ##ture , with a more advanced form of multi ##th ##rea ##ding that uses up to two threads , to improve performance for single threaded and multi ##th ##rea ##ded work ##load ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] intel ' s product change notification ( pc ##n ) 111 ##45 ##6 - 01 lists four models of it ##ani ##um 950 ##0 series cpu , which was later removed in a revised document . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 2012 " he ##wl ##ett - packard co . v . oracle corp . " support lawsuit , court documents un ##sea ##led by a santa clara county court judge revealed that in 2008 , he ##wl ##ett - packard had paid intel around $ 440 million to keep producing and up ##dating it ##ani ##um micro ##pro ##ces ##sor ##s from 2009 to 2014 . [SEP]
[CLS] under the terms of the agreements , hp has to pay for chips it gets from intel , while intel launches tu ##k ##wil ##a , po ##uls ##on , kit ##tson , and kit ##tson + chips in a bid to gradually boost performance of the platform . [SEP]
[CLS] this was at first associated with a forthcoming 22 nm process shrink , and later revised in the face of declining it ##ani ##um sales to a less - ambitious 32 nm node . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 2016 , the hp spin - off he ##wl ##ett packard enterprise ( hp ##e ) announced in computer world that kit ##tson would be released mid - 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 2017 , intel reported that it was shipping kit ##tson to test customers , with plans to ship in volume later that year . [SEP]
[CLS] in comparison with its x ##eon family of server processors , it ##ani ##um has never been a high - volume product for intel . [SEP]
[CLS] for the combined power / spa ##rc / it ##ani ##um systems market , id ##c reports that power captured 42 % of revenue and spa ##rc captured 32 % , while it ##ani ##um - based system revenue reached 26 % in the second quarter of 2008 . [SEP]
[CLS] hp ' s it ##ani ##um system sales were at an annual rate of $ 4 . 4 ##bn at the end of 2008 , and declined to $ 3 . 5 ##bn by the end of 2009 , compared to a 35 % decline in unix system revenue for sun and an 11 % drop for ibm , with an x ##86 - 64 server revenue increase of 14 % during this period . [SEP]
[CLS] in december 2012 , id ##c released a research report stating that it ##ani ##um server shipments would remain flat through 2016 , with annual shipment of 26 , 000 systems ( a decline of over 50 % compared to shipments in 2008 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the bulk of systems sold were enterprise servers and machines for large - scale technical computing , with an average selling price per system in excess of us $ 200 , 000 . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , intel offered a chassis that could be used by system int ##eg ##rator ##s to build it ##ani ##um systems . [SEP]
[CLS] with hp split in late 2015 , it ##ani ##um systems ( branded as integrity ) are handled by he ##wl ##ett - packard enterprise ( hp ##e ) , with recent major update in 2017 ( integrity i ##6 , and hp - u ##x 11 ##i v ##3 update 16 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] development of a chips ##et costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the it ##ani ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] ibm created a chips ##et in 2003 , and intel in 2002 , but neither of them developed chips ##ets to support newer technologies such as dd ##r ##2 or pc ##i express . [SEP]
[CLS] the " tu ##k ##wil ##a " it ##ani ##um processor model had been designed to share a common chips ##et with the intel x ##eon processor ex ( intel ' s x ##eon processor designed for four processor and larger servers ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the goal was to stream ##line system development and reduce costs for server o ##em ##s , many of which develop both it ##ani ##um - and x ##eon - based servers . [SEP]
[CLS] microsoft announced that windows server 2008 r ##2 would be the last version of windows server to support the it ##ani ##um ( support started with xp ) , and that it would also disco ##nti ##nu ##e development of the it ##ani ##um versions of visual studio and sql server . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , red hat enterprise linux 5 ( first released in march 2007 ) was the last it ##ani ##um edition of red hat enterprise linux and de ##bian no longer supports it ##ani ##um officially ( last release with official support was de ##bian 7 / w ##hee ##zy , and was not covered by long term support ( lt ##s ) , but unofficial support for newer de ##bian is still available in limited form via de ##bian ports ; last available kernel in w ##hee ##zy - back ##ports is linux 3 . 14 . 0 , which was released on march 30 , 2014 , but it is possible to manually update to latest 3 . 14 . x version , or more recent kernel versions , like 4 . 17 . 17 as of september 2018 ) and in addition canonical ltd . chose to not support it ##ani ##um for u ##bu ##nt ##u 10 . 04 lt ##s ( released in april 2010 , now discontinued ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in late september 2012 , nec announced a return from ia - 64 to the previous noah line of proprietary main ##frame processors , now produced in a quad - core variant on 40 nm , called noah - 6 . [SEP]
[CLS] to allow more software to run on the it ##ani ##um , intel supported the development of compiler ##s opt ##imi ##zed for the platform , especially its own suite of compiler ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] starting in november 2010 , with the introduction of new product suites , the intel it ##ani ##um compiler ##s were no longer bundled with the intel x ##86 compiler ##s in a single product . [SEP]
[CLS] g ##cc , open ##64 and microsoft visual studio 2005 ( and later ) are also able to produce machine code for it ##ani ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the it ##ani ##um solutions alliance over 13 , 000 applications were available for it ##ani ##um - based systems in early 2008 , though sun has contested it ##ani ##um application counts in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] em ##ulation is a technique that allows a computer to execute binary code that was compiled for a different type of computer . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , hp implemented a method to execute pa - ri ##sc / hp - u ##x on the it ##ani ##um / hp - u ##x via em ##ulation , to sim ##plify migration of its pa - ri ##sc customers to the radically different it ##ani ##um instruction set . [SEP]
[CLS] it ##ani ##um processors can also run the main ##frame environment g ##cos from group ##e bull and several x ##86 operating systems via instruction set simulator ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2005 , it ##ani ##um systems accounted for about 14 % of hp ##c systems revenue , but the percentage has declined as the industry shifted to x ##86 - 64 clusters for this application . [SEP]
[CLS] the best position ever achieved by an " it ##ani ##um 2 " based system in the list was # 2 , achieved in june 2004 , when thunder ( lawrence liver ##more national laboratory ) entered the list with an rm ##ax of 19 . 94 ter ##af ##lo ##ps . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 2004 , columbia entered the list at # 2 with 51 . 8 ter ##af ##lo ##ps , and there was at least one it ##ani ##um - based computer in the top 10 from then until june 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] madison , with the shift to a 130 nm process , allowed for enough cache space to overcome the major performance bottle ##neck ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] monte ##cit ##o , with a 90 nm process , allowed for a dual - core implementation and a major improvement in performance per watt . [SEP]
[CLS] mont ##vale added three new features : core - level locks ##te ##p , demand - based switching and front - side bus frequency of up to 66 ##7 mhz . [SEP]
[CLS] when first released in 2001 , it ##ani ##um ' s performance was disappointing compared to better - established ri ##sc and cis ##c processors . [SEP]
[CLS] em ##ulation to run existing x ##86 applications and operating systems was particularly poor , with one bench ##mark in 2001 reporting that it was equivalent at best to a 100 mhz pen ##tium in this mode ( 1 . 1 ghz pen ##tium ##s were on the market at that time ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in a 2009 article on the history of the processor — " how the it ##ani ##um killed the computer industry " — journalist john c . d ##vor ##ak reported " this continues to be one of the great fia ##sco ##s of the last 50 years " . [SEP]
[CLS] tech columnist ash ##lee vance commented that the delays and under ##per ##form ##ance " turned the product into a joke in the chip industry " . [SEP]
[CLS] in an interview , donald kn ##uth said " the it ##ani ##um approach . . . was supposed to be so terrific — until it turned out that the wished - for compiler ##s were basically impossible to write . " [SEP]
[CLS] both red hat and microsoft announced plans to drop it ##ani ##um support in their operating systems due to lack of market interest ; however , other linux distributions such as gen ##to ##o and de ##bian remain available for it ##ani ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] following this announcement , hp sued oracle for breach of contract , arguing that oracle had violated conditions imposed during settlement over oracle ' s hiring of former hp ceo mark hu ##rd as its co - ceo , requiring the vendor to support it ##ani ##um on its software " until such time as hp disco ##nti ##nu ##es the sales of its it ##ani ##um - based servers " , and that the breach had harmed its business . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 2016 , he ##wl ##ett - packard enterprise ( the corporate successor to hp ' s server business ) was awarded $ 3 billion in damages from the lawsuit . [SEP]
[CLS] a former intel official reported that the it ##ani ##um business had become profitable for intel in late 2009 . [SEP]
[CLS] by 2009 , the chip was almost entirely deployed on servers made by hp , which had over 95 % of the it ##ani ##um server market share , making the main operating system for it ##ani ##um hp - u ##x . [SEP]
[CLS] on march 22 , 2011 , intel re ##af ##firmed its commitment to it ##ani ##um with multiple generations of chips in development and on schedule . [SEP]
[CLS] although it ##ani ##um did attain limited success in the niche market of high - end computing , intel had originally hoped it would find broader acceptance as a replacement for the original x ##86 architecture . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##d chose a different direction , designing the less radical x ##86 - 64 , a 64 - bit extension to the existing x ##86 architecture , which microsoft then supported , forcing intel to introduce the same extensions in its own x ##86 - based processors . [SEP]
[CLS] these designs can run existing 32 - bit applications at native hardware speed , while offering support for 64 - bit memory addressing and other enhancement ##s to new applications . [SEP]
[CLS] although some it ##ani ##um - based works ##tation ##s were initially introduced by companies such as sg ##i , they are no longer available . [SEP]
