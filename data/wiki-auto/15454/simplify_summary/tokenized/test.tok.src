[CLS] it ##ani ##um is a family of 64 - bit intel micro ##pro ##ces ##sor ##s that implement the intel it ##ani ##um architecture ( formerly called ia - 64 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] intel markets the processors for enterprise servers and high - performance computing systems . [SEP]
[CLS] the it ##ani ##um architecture originated at he ##wl ##ett - packard ( hp ) , and was later jointly developed by hp and intel . [SEP]
[CLS] it ##ani ##um - based systems have been produced by hp ( the hp integrity servers line ) and several other manufacturers . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2008 , it ##ani ##um was the fourth - most deployed micro ##pro ##ces ##sor architecture for enterprise - class systems , behind x ##86 - 64 , power isa , and spa ##rc . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 2017 , intel released the current generation , , to test customers , and in may began shipping in volume . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the last processor of the it ##ani ##um family . [SEP]
[CLS] intel officially announced the end of life and product disco ##nti ##nu ##ance of the it ##ani ##um cpu family on january 30th , 2019 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1989 , hp determined that reduced instruction set computing ( ri ##sc ) architecture ##s were approaching a processing limit at one instruction per cycle . [SEP]
[CLS] hp researchers investigated a new architecture , later named explicitly parallel instruction computing ( epic ) , that allows the processor to execute multiple instructions in each clock cycle . [SEP]
[CLS] epic implements a form of very long instruction word ( v ##li ##w ) architecture , in which a single instruction word contains multiple instructions . [SEP]
[CLS] with epic , the compiler determines in advance which instructions can be executed at the same time , so the micro ##pro ##ces ##sor simply execute ##s the instructions and does not need elaborate mechanisms to determine which instructions to execute in parallel . [SEP]
[CLS] the goal of this approach is two ##fold : to enable deeper inspection of the code at com ##pile time to identify additional opportunities for parallel execution , and to sim ##plify processor design and reduce energy consumption by eliminating the need for run ##time scheduling circuit ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] hp believed that it was no longer cost - effective for individual enterprise systems companies such as itself to develop proprietary micro ##pro ##ces ##sor ##s , so it partnered with intel in 1994 to develop the ia - 64 architecture , derived from epic . [SEP]
[CLS] intel was willing to undertake a very large development effort on ia - 64 in the expectation that the resulting micro ##pro ##ces ##sor would be used by the majority of enterprise systems manufacturers . [SEP]
[CLS] hp and intel initiated a large joint development effort with a goal of delivering the first product , mer ##ced , in 1998 . [SEP]
[CLS] during development , intel , hp , and industry analysts predicted that ia - 64 would dominate in servers , works ##tation ##s , and high - end desktop ##s , and eventually su ##pp ##lan ##t ri ##sc and complex instruction set computing ( cis ##c ) architecture ##s for all general - purpose applications . [SEP]
[CLS] com ##pa ##q and silicon graphics decided to abandon further development of the alpha and mi ##ps architecture ##s respectively in favor of migrating to ia - 64 . [SEP]
[CLS] several groups ported operating systems for the architecture , including microsoft windows , open ##v ##ms , linux , hp - u ##x , solar ##is , tr ##u ##64 unix , and monterey / 64 . [SEP]
[CLS] the latter three were canceled before reaching the market . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1997 , it was apparent that the ia - 64 architecture and the compiler were much more difficult to implement than originally thought , and the delivery time ##frame of mer ##ced began slipping . [SEP]
[CLS] intel announced the official name of the processor , " it ##ani ##um " , on october 4 , 1999 . [SEP]
[CLS] within hours , the name " it ##ani ##c " had been coined on a use ##net news ##group , a reference to the rms " titanic " , the " un ##sin ##ka ##ble " ocean liner that sank on her maiden voyage in 1912 . [SEP]
[CLS] " it ##ani ##c " has since often been used by " the register " , and others , to imply that the multi ##bill ##ion - dollar investment in it ##ani ##um — and the early h ##ype associated with it — would be followed by its relatively quick demise . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time it ##ani ##um was released in june 2001 , its performance was not superior to competing ri ##sc and cis ##c processors . [SEP]
[CLS] it ##ani ##um competed at the low - end ( primarily four - cpu and smaller systems ) with servers based on x ##86 processors , and at the high - end with ibm power and sun micro ##systems spa ##rc processors . [SEP]
[CLS] intel rep ##osition ##ed it ##ani ##um to focus on high - end business and hp ##c computing , attempting to duplicate x ##86 ' s successful " horizontal " market ( i . e . , single architecture , multiple systems vendors ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the success of this initial processor version was limited to replacing pa - ri ##sc in hp systems , alpha in com ##pa ##q systems and mi ##ps in sg ##i systems , though ibm also delivered a super ##com ##put ##er based on this processor . [SEP]
[CLS] power and spa ##rc remained strong , while the 32 - bit x ##86 architecture continued to grow into the enterprise space , building on economies of scale fueled by its enormous installed base . [SEP]
[CLS] only a few thousand systems using the original " mer ##ced " it ##ani ##um processor were sold , due to relatively poor performance , high cost and limited software availability . [SEP]
[CLS] recognizing that the lack of software could be a serious problem for the future , intel made thousands of these early systems available to independent software vendors ( is ##vs ) to stimulate development . [SEP]
[CLS] hp and intel brought the next - generation it ##ani ##um 2 processor to market a year later . [SEP]
[CLS] the it ##ani ##um 2 processor was released in 2002 , and was marketed for enterprise servers rather than for the whole ga ##mut of high - end computing . [SEP]
[CLS] the first it ##ani ##um 2 , code - named " mckinley " , was jointly developed by hp and intel . [SEP]
[CLS] it relieved many of the performance problems of the original it ##ani ##um processor , which were mostly caused by an in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt memory sub ##sy ##ste ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] " mckinley " contains 221 million trans ##isto ##rs ( of which 25 million are for logic ) , measured 19 . 5 mm by 21 . 6 mm ( 421 mm ) and was fabricated in a 180 nm , bulk cm ##os process with six layers of aluminium metal ##lization . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2003 , am ##d released the opt ##eron cpu , which implements its own 64 - bit architecture called am ##d ##64 . [SEP]
[CLS] opt ##eron gained rapid acceptance in the enterprise server space because it provided an easy upgrade from x ##86 . [SEP]
[CLS] under influence by microsoft , intel responded by implementing am ##d ' s x ##86 - 64 instruction set architecture instead of ia - 64 in its x ##eon micro ##pro ##ces ##sor ##s in 2004 , resulting in a new industry - wide " de facto " standard . [SEP]
[CLS] intel released a new it ##ani ##um 2 family member , code ##name ##d " madison " , in 2003 . [SEP]
[CLS] madison used a 130 nm process and was the basis of all new it ##ani ##um processors until monte ##cit ##o was released in june 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] in march 2005 , intel announced that it was working on a new it ##ani ##um processor , code ##name ##d " tu ##k ##wil ##a " , to be released in 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] tu ##k ##wil ##a would have four processor cores and would replace the it ##ani ##um bus with a new common system interface , which would also be used by a new x ##eon processor . [SEP]
[CLS] later that year , intel revised tu ##k ##wil ##a ' s delivery date to late 2008 . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 2005 , the major it ##ani ##um server manufacturers joined with intel and a number of software vendors to form the it ##ani ##um solutions alliance to promote the architecture and accelerate software port ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] the alliance announced that its members would invest $ 10 billion in it ##ani ##um solutions by the end of the decade . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2006 , intel delivered " monte ##cit ##o " ( marketed as the it ##ani ##um 2 900 ##0 series ) , a dual - core processor that roughly doubled performance and decreased energy consumption by about 20 percent . [SEP]
[CLS] intel released the it ##ani ##um 2 910 ##0 series , code ##name ##d " mont ##vale " , in november 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 2009 , the schedule for tu ##k ##wil ##a , its follow - on , was revised again , with release to o ##em ##s planned for the first quarter of 2010 . [SEP]
[CLS] the it ##ani ##um 930 ##0 series processor , code ##name ##d " tu ##k ##wil ##a " , was released on february 8 , 2010 , with greater performance and memory capacity . [SEP]
[CLS] the device uses a 65 nm process , includes two to four cores , up to 24 mb on - die cache ##s , hyper - thread ##ing technology and integrated memory controllers . [SEP]
[CLS] it implements double - device data correction , which helps to fix memory errors . [SEP]
[CLS] tu ##k ##wil ##a also implements intel quick ##path inter ##con ##ne ##ct ( q ##pi ) to replace the it ##ani ##um bus - based architecture . [SEP]
[CLS] it has a peak inter ##pro ##ces ##sor bandwidth of 96 gb / s and a peak memory bandwidth of 34 gb / s . [SEP]
[CLS] with quick ##path , the processor has integrated memory controllers and interfaces the memory directly , using q ##pi interfaces to directly connect to other processors and i / o hub ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] quick ##path is also used on intel processors using the " ne ##hale ##m " micro ##ar ##chi ##tec ##ture , which possibly enabled tu ##k ##wil ##a and ne ##hale ##m to use the same chips ##ets . [SEP]
[CLS] tu ##k ##wil ##a incorporates four memory controllers , each of which supports multiple dd ##r ##3 dim ##ms via a separate memory controller , much like the ne ##hale ##m - based x ##eon processor code - named " beck ##ton " . [SEP]
[CLS] the it ##ani ##um 950 ##0 series processor , code ##name ##d " po ##uls ##on " , is the follow - on processor to tu ##k ##wil ##a and was released on november 8 , 2012 . [SEP]
[CLS] according to intel , it skip ##s the 45 nm process technology and uses a 32 nm process technology . [SEP]
[CLS] it features eight cores and has a 12 - wide issue architecture , multi ##th ##rea ##ding enhancement ##s , and new instructions to take advantage of parallel ##ism , especially in virtual ##ization . [SEP]
[CLS] the po ##uls ##on l ##3 cache size is 32 mb . [SEP]
[CLS] l ##2 cache size is 6 mb , 512 i kb , 256 d kb per core . [SEP]
[CLS] die size is 54 ##4 mm ##2 , less than its predecessor tu ##k ##wil ##a ( 69 ##8 . 75 mm ##2 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] at iss ##cc 2011 , intel presented a paper called " a 32 ##n ##m 3 . 1 billion trans ##isto ##r 12 - wide - issue it ##ani ##um processor for mission critical servers . " [SEP]
[CLS] given intel ' s history of disc ##los ##ing details about it ##ani ##um micro ##pro ##ces ##sor ##s at iss ##cc , this paper most likely referred to po ##uls ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] analyst david kant ##er speculated that po ##uls ##on would use a new micro ##ar ##chi ##tec ##ture , with a more advanced form of multi ##th ##rea ##ding that uses up to two threads , to improve performance for single threaded and multi ##th ##rea ##ded work ##load ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] some information was also released at the hot chips conference . [SEP]
[CLS] information presented improvements in multi ##th ##rea ##ding , res ##ili ##ency improvements ( intel instruction replay ras ) and few new instructions ( thread priority , integer instruction , cache pre ##fe ##tch ##ing , and data access hints ) . [SEP]
[CLS] intel ' s product change notification ( pc ##n ) 111 ##45 ##6 - 01 lists four models of it ##ani ##um 950 ##0 series cpu , which was later removed in a revised document . [SEP]
[CLS] the parts were later listed in intel ' s material declaration data sheets ( md ##ds ) database . [SEP]
[CLS] intel later posted it ##ani ##um 950 ##0 reference manual . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 2012 " he ##wl ##ett - packard co . v . oracle corp . " support lawsuit , court documents un ##sea ##led by a santa clara county court judge revealed that in 2008 , he ##wl ##ett - packard had paid intel around $ 440 million to keep producing and up ##dating it ##ani ##um micro ##pro ##ces ##sor ##s from 2009 to 2014 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2010 , the two companies signed another $ 250 million deal , which obliged intel to continue making it ##ani ##um cpu ##s for hp ' s machines until 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] under the terms of the agreements , hp has to pay for chips it gets from intel , while intel launches tu ##k ##wil ##a , po ##uls ##on , kit ##tson , and kit ##tson + chips in a bid to gradually boost performance of the platform . [SEP]
[CLS] rumors of a successor to po ##uls ##on ( code named " kit ##tson " ) began to ci ##rc ##ulate in 2012 – 2013 . [SEP]
[CLS] this was at first associated with a forthcoming 22 nm process shrink , and later revised in the face of declining it ##ani ##um sales to a less - ambitious 32 nm node . [SEP]
[CLS] in april 2015 , intel , although it had not yet confirmed formal specifications , did confirm that it continued to work on the project . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , the aggressively multi ##core x ##eon e ##7 platform displaced it ##ani ##um - based solutions in the intel road ##ma ##p . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 2016 , the hp spin - off he ##wl ##ett packard enterprise ( hp ##e ) announced in computer world that kit ##tson would be released mid - 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 2017 , intel reported that it was shipping kit ##tson to test customers , with plans to ship in volume later that year . [SEP]
[CLS] intel officially launched the it ##ani ##um 97 ##00 series processor family on may 11 , 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] notably , kit ##tson has no micro ##ar ##chi ##tec ##ture improvements over po ##uls ##on , only higher clock speeds . [SEP]
[CLS] intel has announced that the 97 ##00 series will be the last it ##ani ##um chips produced . [SEP]
[CLS] in comparison with its x ##eon family of server processors , it ##ani ##um has never been a high - volume product for intel . [SEP]
[CLS] intel does not release production numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] one industry analyst estimated that the production rate was 200 , 000 processors per year in 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] according to ga ##rt ##ner inc . , the total number of it ##ani ##um servers ( not processors ) sold by all vendors in 2007 , was about 55 , 000 . [SEP]
[CLS] ( it is unclear whether clustered servers counted as a single server or not . ) [SEP]
[CLS] this compares with 417 , 000 ri ##sc servers ( spread across all ri ##sc vendors ) and 8 . 4 million x ##86 servers . [SEP]
[CLS] id ##c reports that a total of 184 , 000 it ##ani ##um - based systems were sold from 2001 through 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] for the combined power / spa ##rc / it ##ani ##um systems market , id ##c reports that power captured 42 % of revenue and spa ##rc captured 32 % , while it ##ani ##um - based system revenue reached 26 % in the second quarter of 2008 . [SEP]
[CLS] according to an id ##c analyst , in 2007 , hp accounted for perhaps 80 % of it ##ani ##um systems revenue . [SEP]
[CLS] according to ga ##rt ##ner , in 2008 , hp accounted for 95 % of it ##ani ##um sales . [SEP]
[CLS] hp ' s it ##ani ##um system sales were at an annual rate of $ 4 . 4 ##bn at the end of 2008 , and declined to $ 3 . 5 ##bn by the end of 2009 , compared to a 35 % decline in unix system revenue for sun and an 11 % drop for ibm , with an x ##86 - 64 server revenue increase of 14 % during this period . [SEP]
[CLS] in december 2012 , id ##c released a research report stating that it ##ani ##um server shipments would remain flat through 2016 , with annual shipment of 26 , 000 systems ( a decline of over 50 % compared to shipments in 2008 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] by 2006 , hp manufactured at least 80 % of all it ##ani ##um systems , and sold 7 , 200 in the first quarter of 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] the bulk of systems sold were enterprise servers and machines for large - scale technical computing , with an average selling price per system in excess of us $ 200 , 000 . [SEP]
[CLS] a typical system uses eight or more it ##ani ##um processors . [SEP]
[CLS] by 2012 , only a few manufacturers offered it ##ani ##um systems , including hp , bull , nec , ins ##pur and hua ##wei . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , intel offered a chassis that could be used by system int ##eg ##rator ##s to build it ##ani ##um systems . [SEP]
[CLS] by 2015 , only hp supplied it ##ani ##um - based systems . [SEP]
[CLS] with hp split in late 2015 , it ##ani ##um systems ( branded as integrity ) are handled by he ##wl ##ett - packard enterprise ( hp ##e ) , with recent major update in 2017 ( integrity i ##6 , and hp - u ##x 11 ##i v ##3 update 16 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] hp ##e also supports a few other operating systems , including windows up to server 2008 r ##2 , linux , open ##v ##ms and nonstop . [SEP]
[CLS] it ##ani ##um is not affected by spec ##tre and melt ##down . [SEP]
[CLS] the it ##ani ##um bus interfaces to the rest of the system via a chips ##et . [SEP]
[CLS] enterprise server manufacturers differentiate their systems by designing and developing chips ##ets that interface the processor to memory , inter ##con ##ne ##ctions , and peripheral controllers . [SEP]
[CLS] the chips ##et is the heart of the system - level architecture for each system design . [SEP]
[CLS] development of a chips ##et costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the it ##ani ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] ibm created a chips ##et in 2003 , and intel in 2002 , but neither of them developed chips ##ets to support newer technologies such as dd ##r ##2 or pc ##i express . [SEP]
[CLS] before " tu ##k ##wil ##a " moved away from the f ##sb , chips ##ets supporting such technologies were manufactured by all it ##ani ##um server vendors , such as hp , fuji ##tsu , sg ##i , nec , and hit ##achi . [SEP]
[CLS] the " tu ##k ##wil ##a " it ##ani ##um processor model had been designed to share a common chips ##et with the intel x ##eon processor ex ( intel ' s x ##eon processor designed for four processor and larger servers ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the goal was to stream ##line system development and reduce costs for server o ##em ##s , many of which develop both it ##ani ##um - and x ##eon - based servers . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in 2013 , this goal was pushed back to " evaluated for future implementation opportunities " . [SEP]
[CLS] microsoft announced that windows server 2008 r ##2 would be the last version of windows server to support the it ##ani ##um ( support started with xp ) , and that it would also disco ##nti ##nu ##e development of the it ##ani ##um versions of visual studio and sql server . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , red hat enterprise linux 5 ( first released in march 2007 ) was the last it ##ani ##um edition of red hat enterprise linux and de ##bian no longer supports it ##ani ##um officially ( last release with official support was de ##bian 7 / w ##hee ##zy , and was not covered by long term support ( lt ##s ) , but unofficial support for newer de ##bian is still available in limited form via de ##bian ports ; last available kernel in w ##hee ##zy - back ##ports is linux 3 . 14 . 0 , which was released on march 30 , 2014 , but it is possible to manually update to latest 3 . 14 . x version , or more recent kernel versions , like 4 . 17 . 17 as of september 2018 ) and in addition canonical ltd . chose to not support it ##ani ##um for u ##bu ##nt ##u 10 . 04 lt ##s ( released in april 2010 , now discontinued ) . [SEP]
[CLS] hp will not be supporting or ce ##rti ##fying linux on it ##ani ##um 930 ##0 ( tu ##k ##wil ##a ) servers . [SEP]
[CLS] in late september 2012 , nec announced a return from ia - 64 to the previous noah line of proprietary main ##frame processors , now produced in a quad - core variant on 40 nm , called noah - 6 . [SEP]
[CLS] hp sells a virtual ##ization technology for it ##ani ##um called integrity virtual machines . [SEP]
[CLS] to allow more software to run on the it ##ani ##um , intel supported the development of compiler ##s opt ##imi ##zed for the platform , especially its own suite of compiler ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] starting in november 2010 , with the introduction of new product suites , the intel it ##ani ##um compiler ##s were no longer bundled with the intel x ##86 compiler ##s in a single product . [SEP]
[CLS] intel offers it ##ani ##um tools and intel x ##86 tools , including compiler ##s , independently in different product bundles . [SEP]
[CLS] g ##cc , open ##64 and microsoft visual studio 2005 ( and later ) are also able to produce machine code for it ##ani ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the it ##ani ##um solutions alliance over 13 , 000 applications were available for it ##ani ##um - based systems in early 2008 , though sun has contested it ##ani ##um application counts in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] the isa also supported gel ##ato , an it ##ani ##um hp ##c user group and developer community that ported and supported open - source software for it ##ani ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] em ##ulation is a technique that allows a computer to execute binary code that was compiled for a different type of computer . [SEP]
[CLS] before ibm ' s acquisition of quick ##tra ##ns ##it in 2009 , application binary software for ir ##ix / mi ##ps and solar ##is / spa ##rc could run via type of em ##ulation called " dynamic binary translation " on linux / it ##ani ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , hp implemented a method to execute pa - ri ##sc / hp - u ##x on the it ##ani ##um / hp - u ##x via em ##ulation , to sim ##plify migration of its pa - ri ##sc customers to the radically different it ##ani ##um instruction set . [SEP]
[CLS] it ##ani ##um processors can also run the main ##frame environment g ##cos from group ##e bull and several x ##86 operating systems via instruction set simulator ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it ##ani ##um is aimed at the enterprise server and high - performance computing ( hp ##c ) markets . [SEP]
[CLS] other enterprise - and hp ##c - focused processor lines include oracle ' s and fuji ##tsu ' s spa ##rc processors and ibm ' s power micro ##pro ##ces ##sor ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] measured by quantity sold , it ##ani ##um ' s most serious competition comes from x ##86 - 64 processors including intel ' s own x ##eon line and am ##d ' s opt ##eron line . [SEP]
[CLS] since 2009 , most servers were being shipped with x ##86 - 64 processors . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2005 , it ##ani ##um systems accounted for about 14 % of hp ##c systems revenue , but the percentage has declined as the industry shifted to x ##86 - 64 clusters for this application . [SEP]
[CLS] an october 2008 ga ##rt ##ner report on the tu ##k ##wil ##a processor , stated that " . . . the future road ##ma ##p for it ##ani ##um looks as strong as that of any ri ##sc peer like power or spa ##rc . " [SEP]
[CLS] an it ##ani ##um - based computer first appeared on the list of the top ##500 super ##com ##put ##ers in november 2001 . [SEP]
[CLS] the best position ever achieved by an " it ##ani ##um 2 " based system in the list was # 2 , achieved in june 2004 , when thunder ( lawrence liver ##more national laboratory ) entered the list with an rm ##ax of 19 . 94 ter ##af ##lo ##ps . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 2004 , columbia entered the list at # 2 with 51 . 8 ter ##af ##lo ##ps , and there was at least one it ##ani ##um - based computer in the top 10 from then until june 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] the peak number of it ##ani ##um - based machines on the list occurred in the november 2004 list , at 84 systems ( 16 . 8 % ) ; by june 2012 , this had dropped to one system ( 0 . 2 % ) , and no it ##ani ##um system remained on the list in november 2012 . [SEP]
[CLS] the it ##ani ##um processors show a progression in capability . [SEP]
[CLS] mer ##ced was a proof of concept . [SEP]
[CLS] mckinley dramatically improved the memory hierarchy and allowed it ##ani ##um to become reasonably competitive . [SEP]
[CLS] madison , with the shift to a 130 nm process , allowed for enough cache space to overcome the major performance bottle ##neck ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] monte ##cit ##o , with a 90 nm process , allowed for a dual - core implementation and a major improvement in performance per watt . [SEP]
[CLS] mont ##vale added three new features : core - level locks ##te ##p , demand - based switching and front - side bus frequency of up to 66 ##7 mhz . [SEP]
[CLS] when first released in 2001 , it ##ani ##um ' s performance was disappointing compared to better - established ri ##sc and cis ##c processors . [SEP]
[CLS] em ##ulation to run existing x ##86 applications and operating systems was particularly poor , with one bench ##mark in 2001 reporting that it was equivalent at best to a 100 mhz pen ##tium in this mode ( 1 . 1 ghz pen ##tium ##s were on the market at that time ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it ##ani ##um failed to make significant in ##ro ##ads against ia - 32 or ri ##sc , and suffered further following the arrival of x ##86 - 64 systems which offered greater compatibility with older x ##86 applications . [SEP]
[CLS] in a 2009 article on the history of the processor — " how the it ##ani ##um killed the computer industry " — journalist john c . d ##vor ##ak reported " this continues to be one of the great fia ##sco ##s of the last 50 years " . [SEP]
[CLS] tech columnist ash ##lee vance commented that the delays and under ##per ##form ##ance " turned the product into a joke in the chip industry " . [SEP]
[CLS] in an interview , donald kn ##uth said " the it ##ani ##um approach . . . was supposed to be so terrific — until it turned out that the wished - for compiler ##s were basically impossible to write . " [SEP]
[CLS] both red hat and microsoft announced plans to drop it ##ani ##um support in their operating systems due to lack of market interest ; however , other linux distributions such as gen ##to ##o and de ##bian remain available for it ##ani ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] on march 22 , 2011 , oracle corporation announced that it would no longer develop new products for hp - u ##x on it ##ani ##um , although it would continue to provide support for existing products . [SEP]
[CLS] following this announcement , hp sued oracle for breach of contract , arguing that oracle had violated conditions imposed during settlement over oracle ' s hiring of former hp ceo mark hu ##rd as its co - ceo , requiring the vendor to support it ##ani ##um on its software " until such time as hp disco ##nti ##nu ##es the sales of its it ##ani ##um - based servers " , and that the breach had harmed its business . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2012 , a court ruled in favor of hp , and ordered oracle to resume its support for it ##ani ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 2016 , he ##wl ##ett - packard enterprise ( the corporate successor to hp ' s server business ) was awarded $ 3 billion in damages from the lawsuit . [SEP]
[CLS] a former intel official reported that the it ##ani ##um business had become profitable for intel in late 2009 . [SEP]
[CLS] by 2009 , the chip was almost entirely deployed on servers made by hp , which had over 95 % of the it ##ani ##um server market share , making the main operating system for it ##ani ##um hp - u ##x . [SEP]
[CLS] on march 22 , 2011 , intel re ##af ##firmed its commitment to it ##ani ##um with multiple generations of chips in development and on schedule . [SEP]
[CLS] although it ##ani ##um did attain limited success in the niche market of high - end computing , intel had originally hoped it would find broader acceptance as a replacement for the original x ##86 architecture . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##d chose a different direction , designing the less radical x ##86 - 64 , a 64 - bit extension to the existing x ##86 architecture , which microsoft then supported , forcing intel to introduce the same extensions in its own x ##86 - based processors . [SEP]
[CLS] these designs can run existing 32 - bit applications at native hardware speed , while offering support for 64 - bit memory addressing and other enhancement ##s to new applications . [SEP]
[CLS] this architecture has now become the predominant 64 - bit architecture in the desktop and portable market . [SEP]
[CLS] although some it ##ani ##um - based works ##tation ##s were initially introduced by companies such as sg ##i , they are no longer available . [SEP]
[CLS] 1989 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2017 2019 [SEP]
