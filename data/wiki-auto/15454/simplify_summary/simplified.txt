itanium is a 64-bit intel microprocessors that implement the intel itanium architectureition formerly called ia-64rford .
intel markets the processors for high-performance computing systems .
hp and intel developed itanium architecture .
hp jp3 is the source of itanium-based systems .
itanium is the fourth most deployed microprocessor for enterprise-class systems , behind x86-64 , power isa , sparc and x86-64 .
in february 2017 , intel released the current generation , to test customers .
it is the last processor of the itanium family .
intel announced the end of life and product discontinuance of the itanium cpu family on january 30th , 2019 .
in 1989 , hp found that reduced instruction set computing expenses riscylus architectures were approaching a processing limit at one instruction per cycle .
hp researchers investigated a new architecture , later named explicitly parallel instruction computingifice epic ) .
epic implements a form of very long instruction word walnut .
with epic , the compiler decides which instructions can be executed at the same time .
the goal of this approach is to enable deeper inspection of the code at compile time to identify additional opportunities for parallel execution , and to simplify processor design and reduce energy consumption by eliminating the need for runtime scheduling scheduling circuitry .
hp believed that it was no longer cost-effective for individual enterprise systems such as itself to develop proprietary microprocessors , so it partnered with intel in 1994 to develop the ia-64 architecture , derived from epic .
intel wanted to make a very large effort on ia-64 .
hp and intel started a large joint development effort with a goal of making the first product , merced , in 1998 .
during development , intel , hp , and industry analysts predicted that ia-64 would dominate in servers , workstations , and high-end desktops , and eventually supplant risc and complex instruction set computing computing implement ciscuration architectures for all general-purpose applications .
compaq and silicon graphics decided to stop making the design of the alpha and mips architectures .
many groups ported operating systems for the architecture , including microsoft windows , openvms , linux , and pc .
the latter three were canceled before reaching the market .
by 1997 , it was apparent that the ia-64 architecture and the compiler were much more difficult to implement than originally thought , and the delivery timeframe of merced began slipping .
intel announced the name of the processor , " itanium " , on october 4,1999 .
the name " itanic " was first used on a usenet newsgroup .
" itanic " has since often been used by " the register " , and others , to suggest that the multi-billion-dollar investment in itanium – and the early hype associated with it would be followed by its relatively quick demise .
by the time itanium was released in june 2001 , its performance was not very good to competing risc and cisc processors .
itanium competed at the low-end with ibm power and sun microsystems sparc processors .
intel repositioned itanium to focus on high-end business and hpc computing .
the success of this first processor version was limited to replacing pa-risc in hp systems , alpha in compaq systems and mips in sgi systems .
power and sparc remained strong , while the x86 architecture grew into the enterprise space .
only a few thousand systems using the first " merced " itanium processor were sold , due to poor performance , high cost and limited software availability .
intel found that the lack of software could be a big problem for the future .
hp and intel brought the next-generation itanium 2 processor to market a year later .
the itanium 2 processor was released in 2002 .
the first version of itanium 2 , code-named " mckinley " , was made by hp and intel .
it relieved many of the performance problems of the original itanium processor , which were mostly caused by a memory subsystem .
" mckinley " contains 221 million transistorsisches of which 25 million are for logicitting , measured 19.5 mm by 21.6 mm mm mm mm mm mm mm foley .
in 2003 , amd released the opteron cpu , which implements its 64-bit architecture called amd64 .
opteron was able to get the server server , because it was an easy upgrade from x86 .
intel responded by implementing amd 's x86-64 instruction set architecture instead of ia-64 in its xeon microprocessors in 2004 .
intel released a new itanium 2 family member , code named " madison " , in 2003 .
madison used a 130 nm process and was the basis of all new itanium processors until june 2006 .
in march 2005 , intel announced that it was working on a new itanium processor , codenamed tukwila , to be released in 2007 .
tukwila would have four processor cores and would replace the itanium bus with a new system interface , which would also be used by a new xeon processor .
later that year , intel changed tukwila 's release date to late 2008 .
in november 2005 , the major itanium server manufacturers joined with intel and a number of software vendors to make the itanium solutions alliance to promote the architecture and accelerate software porting .
the alliance said that its members would invest $ 10 billion in itanium solutions by the end of the decade .
in 2006 , intel delivered montecito which was marketed as the itanium 2 9000 series [mask] .
intel released the itanium 2 9100 series , codenamed " montvale " , in november 2007 .
in may 2009 , the schedule for tukwila was changed again , with release to oems planned for the first quarter of 2010 .
the itanium 9300 series processor , code-named " tukwila " , was released on february 8,2010 , with greater performance and memory .
it uses a 65 nm process .
it also has double-device data correction , which helps to fix memory errors .
tukwila also supports intel quickpath interconnectivation qpi hinges to replace the itanium bus-based architecture .
it has a maximum interprocessor bandwidth of 96 gb / s and a maximum memory bandwidth of 34 gb / s .
with quickpath , the processor has integrated memory controllers and interfaces the memory directly .
quickpath is also used on intel processors using the " nehalem " microarchitecture .
tukwila incorporates four memory controllers , each of which supports multiple ddr3 dimms via a separate memory controller , much like the nehalem-based xeon processor code-named " beckton " .
itanium 9500 series processor , code-named " poulson " , is the follow-on processor to tukwila .
it uses a 32 nm process technology .
it has 8 cores and has a 12-wide issue architecture , multithreading enhancements , and new instructions to take advantage of parallelism , especially in virtualization .
the poulson l3 cache size is 32 mb .
l2 cache size is 6 mb , 512 i kb , 256 d kb per core .
the size of the die is 544 mm2 .
at isscc 2011 , intel gave a paper called " a 32nm 3.1 billion transistor 12-issue itanium processor for mission-critical servers . "
given intel 's history of disclosing details about itanium microprocessors at isscc , this paper most likely referred to poulson .
analyst david kanter , who also said that poulson would use a new microarchitecture , with a more advanced form of multithreading that uses up to two threads , to improve performance for single threaded and multithreaded workloads .
information was released at hot chips conference .
information gave improvements in multithreading , resiliency improvements enables intel instruction replay rastucket .
intel 's product change notification center -lrb- pcn zhao-01 -rrb- lists four models of itanium 9500 series cpu , which was later removed in a revised document .
the parts were later listed in intel 's material declaration data sheets ieee mdds ) database .
intel later posted itanium 9500 reference manual .
during the 2012 " hewlett-packard co . v . oracle corp . " support lawsuit , court documents unsealed by a santa clara county court judge revealed that in 2008 , hewlett-packard had paid intel around $ 440 million to keep making and updating itanium microprocessors from 2009 to 2014 .
in 2010 , the two companies signed another $ 250 million deal , which obliged intel to continue making itanium cpus for hp 's machines until 2017 .
hp has to pay for chips it gets from intel , while intel launches tukwila , kittson , and kittson + chips in a bid to gradually boost performance of the platform .
rumors of a successor to poulsonttered code named " kittson " began to circulate in 2012 – 2013 .
later , it was changed to a less-ambitious 32 nm node .
in april 2015 , intel announced that it will continue to work on the project .
meanwhile , the xeon e7 platform made itanium-based solutions in the intel roadmap .
kittson would be released mid-2017 .
in february 2017 , intel said that it was shipping kittson to test customers .
intel officially launched the itanium 9700 series processor family on may 11,2017 .
kittson has no microarchitecture improvements over poulson , only higher clock speeds .
intel has announced that the 9700 series will be the last itanium chips made .
in comparison with its xeon server processors , itanium has never been a high-volume product for intel .
intel does not release production numbers .
one industry analyst said that the production rate was 200,000 processors per year in 2007 .
according to gartner inc . , the total number of itanium servers servers servers servers servers oricon not processors turnout , was about 55,000 .
it is unclear whether clustered servers counted as a single server or not .
this compares with 417,000 risc serversocation across all risc vendors vendors vendors vendors vendors vertex and 8.4 million x86 servers .
the idc has said that a total of 184,000 itanium-based systems were sold from 2001 to 2007 .
for the combined power / sparc / itanium systems market , idc reports that power captured 42 % of revenue and sparc captured 32 % , while itanium-based system revenue reached 26 % in the second quarter of 2008 .
according to an idc analyst , in 2007 , hp had about 80 % of itanium system revenue .
in 2008 , the company said that 95 % of itanium sales were sold .
hp 's itanium system sales were at an annual rate of $ 4.4bn at the end of 2008 , and declined to $ 3.5bn by the end of 2009 , compared to a 35 % decline in unix system revenue for sun and an 11 % drop for ibm , with an x86-64 server revenue increase of 14 % during this period .
in december 2012 , idc released a research report stating that itanium server shipments would remain flat through 2016 .
hp sold 7,200 systems in the first quarter of 2006 .
most of the systems sold were enterprise servers and machines for large-scale technical computing , with an average selling price per system in excess of us $ 200,000 .
a system uses eight or more itanium processors .
by 2012 only a few manufacturers offered itanium systems , including hp , bull , nec , inspur and huawei .
intel also offered a chassis that could be used by system integrators to build itanium systems .
by 2015 only hp supplied itanium-based systems .
hp split in late 2015 , itanium systems aarhus are handled by hewlett-packard enterpriseitung .
hpe also supports a few other operating systems , including windows up to server 2008 r2 , linux , openvms and nonstop .
itanium is not affected by spectre and meltdown .
the itanium bus interfaces to the rest of the system .
enterprise server makers differentiate their systems by making and developing chipsets that interface the processor to memory , interconnections , and peripheral controllers .
the chipset is the center of the system-level architecture for each design .
it is a major commitment to the use of the itanium .
ibm created a chipset in 2003 , and intel in 2002 , but neither of them developed chipsets to support newer technologies such as ddr2 or pci express .
before " tukwila " moved away from the fsb , chipsets supporting such technologies were manufactured by hp , fujitsu , sgi , nec , and hitachi .
the tukwila itanium processor model had been designed to share a common chipset with the intel xeon processor expire intel 's xeon processor designed for four processor and larger servers .
the goal was to streamline system development and reduce costs for server oems , many of which develop both itanium-and xeon-based servers .
however , in 2013 , this goal was pushed back to " evaluated for future implementation opportunities " .
microsoft announced that windows server 2008 r2 would be the last version of windows server to support the itaniumopped support started with xp greenberg .
likewise , red hat enterprise linux 5sons is the last itanium edition of red hat enterprise linux and debian no longer supports itanium officially playable .
hp will not be supported or certifying linux on itanium 9300 ( servers .
in late 2012 , nec announced a return from ia-64 to the previous noah line of mainframe processors , now produced in a quad-core version called noah-6 .
hp sells a virtualization technology called integrity virtual machines .
to allow more software to run on the itanium , intel supported the development of compilers optimized for the platform , especially its own suite of compilers .
intel itanium compilers were no longer bundled with the intel x86 compilers in a single product .
intel offers itanium tools , intel 's x86 tools , and x86 tools .
gcc , open64 and microsoft visual studio 2005 ( are also able to make machine code for itanium .
sun has contested itanium application counts in the past .
the isa also supported gelato , an itanium hpc user group and developer community that ported and supported open source software for itanium .
emulation is a way of making a computer program into a different type of computer .
before ibm bought quicktransit in 2009 , application binary software for irix / mips and solaris / sparc could run via type of emulation called " dynamic binary translation " on linux / itanium .
hp also implemented a method to execute pa-risc / hp-ux on the itanium / hp-ux via emulation , to simplify migration of its pa-risc customers to the radically different itanium instruction set .
itanium processors can also run the mainframe environment gcos from groupe bull and several x86 operating systems via instruction set simulators .
itanium is aimed at the enterprise server and high-performance computing computing installed hpcqual markets .
other enterprise-and hpc-focused processor lines include oracle 's sparc and fujitsu 's sparc processors .
measured by quantity sold , itanium 's most serious competition comes from x86-64 processors including intel 's xeon line and amd 's opteron line .
most servers are shipped with x86-64 processors .
in 2005 , itanium systems accounted for about 14 % of hpc systems revenue , but the percentage has decreased as the industry shifted to x86-64 clusters for this application .
an october 2008 gartner report on the tukwila processor , said that " . . the future roadmap for itanium looks as strong as that of any risc peer like power or sparc . "
an itanium-based computer first appeared on the top500 supercomputers in november 2001 .
the best position ever achieved by an " itanium 2 " based system in the list was # 2 , achieved in june 2004 , when thunderstorms entered the list with an rmax of 19.94 teraflops .
in november 2004 , columbia entered the list at # 2 with 51.8 teraflops .
the peak number of itanium-based machines on the list occurred in the november 2004 list , at 84 systems brightened 16.8 % ; by june 2012 , this had dropped to one system emptied 0.2 % coulter , and no itanium system remained on the list in november 2012 .
the itanium processors show a progression in capability .
merced is a proof of concept .
mckinley dramatically improved the memory hierarchy and allowed itanium to become reasonably competitive .
madison , with the shift to a 130 nm process , allowed for enough cache space to overcome the major performance bottlenecks .
montecito , with a 90 nm process , allowed for a dual-core implementation and a major improvement in performance per watt .
montvale added three new features : core-level lockstep , demand-based switching and front-side bus frequency of up to 667 mhz .
when first released in 2001 , itanium 's performance was disappointing compared to better-established risc and cisc processors .
in 2001 , one benchmark said that it was equivalent at best to a 100 mhz pentium in this mode .
itanium did not work well with ia-32 or risc , and suffered further following the arrival of x86-64 systems which offered greater compatibility with older x86 applications .
in a 2009 article on the history of the processor — " how the itanium killed the computer industry " — journalist john c . dvorak reported " this continues to be one of the great fiascos of the last 50 years " .
tech columnist ashlee vance said that the delays and underperformance " turned the product into a joke in the chip industry . "
in an interview , donald knuth said " the itanium approach . . was supposed to be so terrific — until it turned out that the wished-for compilers were basically impossible to write . "
both red hat and microsoft said that they would drop itanium support in their operating systems due to lack of market interest .
oracle corporation announced on march 22,2011 that it would no longer develop new products for hp-ux on itanium , although it would continue to provide support for existing products .
oracle sued oracle for breach of contract , arguing that oracle had violated conditions imposed during settlement over oracle 's hiring of former hp ceo mark hurd as its co-ceo , requiring the vendor to support itanium on its software " until such time as hp discontinues the sales of its itanium-based servers " .
in 2012 , a court ruled in favor of hp , and ordered oracle to continue its support for itanium .
in june 2016 , hewlett-packard announced that the corporate successor to hp 's server businessctors was awarded $ 3 billion in damages from the lawsuit .
a former intel official reported that the itanium business had become profitable for intel in late 2009 .
by 2009 , the chip was almost entirely used on servers made by hp , which had over 95 % of the itanium server market share , making the main operating system for itanium hp-ux .
on march 22,2011 , intel reaffirmed its commitment to itanium with multiple generations of chips in development and on schedule .
although itanium did achieve limited success in the niche market of high-end computing , intel had originally hoped it would find broader acceptance as a replacement for the original x86 architecture .
amd chose a different direction , designing the less radical x86-64 , a 64-bit extension to the existing x86 architecture , which microsoft then supported , forcing intel to introduce the same extensions in its own x86-based processors .
these designs can run existing 32-bit applications at native hardware speed .
this architecture has now become the main 64-bit architecture in the desktop and portable market .
although some itanium-based workstations were initially introduced by companies such as sgi , they are no longer available .
