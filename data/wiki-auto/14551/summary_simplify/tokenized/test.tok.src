[CLS] the production of information has long been regarded as a service , but some economists now attribute it to a fourth sector , the qu ##ater ##nary sector . [SEP]
[CLS] the tertiary sector of industry involves the provision of services to other businesses as well as final consumers . [SEP]
[CLS] services may involve the transport , distribution and sale of goods from producer to a consumer , as may happen in whole ##sal ##ing and retail ##ing , pest control or entertainment . [SEP]
[CLS] the goods may be transformed in the process of providing the service , as happens in the restaurant industry . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the focus is on people interacting with people and serving the customer rather than transforming physical goods . [SEP]
[CLS] it is sometimes hard to define whether a given company is part and parcel of the secondary or tertiary sector . [SEP]
[CLS] and it is not only companies that have been classified as part of that sector in some schemes ; government and its services such as police or military , and non - profit organizations such as charities or research associations can also be seen as part of that sector . [SEP]
[CLS] for purposes of finance and market research , market - based classification systems such as the global industry classification standard and the industry classification bench ##mark are used to classify businesses that participate in the service sector . [SEP]
[CLS] for the last 100 years , there has been a substantial shift from the primary and secondary sectors to the tertiary sector in industrial ##ized countries . [SEP]
[CLS] the tertiary sector is now the largest sector of the economy in the western world , and is also the fastest - growing sector . [SEP]
[CLS] economies tend to follow a developmental progression that takes them from a heavy reliance on agriculture and mining , toward the development of manufacturing ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , manufacturing tended to be more open to international trade and competition than services . [SEP]
[CLS] however , with dramatic cost reduction and speed and reliability improvements in the transportation of people and the communication of information , the service sector now includes some of the most intensive international competition , despite residual protection ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] services are int ##ang ##ible , making it difficult for potential customers to understand what they will receive and what value it will hold for them . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , some , such as consultants and providers of investment services , offer no guarantees of the value for price paid . [SEP]
[CLS] since the quality of most services depends largely on the quality of the individuals providing the services , " people costs " are usually a high fraction of service costs . [SEP]
[CLS] whereas a manufacturer may use technology , sim ##pl ##ification , and other techniques to lower the cost of goods sold , the service provider often faces an un ##rel ##enting pattern of increasing costs . [SEP]
[CLS] charging a premium for services is usually an option only for the most established firms , who charge extra based upon brand recognition . [SEP]
