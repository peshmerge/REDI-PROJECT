[CLS] the garden of eden ( hebrew : ג ##ן ־ ע ##ד ##ן – " gan - ʿ ##ede ##n " ) , also called paradise , is the biblical " garden of god " described in the book of genesis and the book of ezekiel . [SEP]
[CLS] genesis 13 : 10 refers to the " garden of god " , and the " trees of the garden " are mentioned in ezekiel 31 . [SEP]
[CLS] the book of ze ##cha ##ria ##h and the book of psalms also refer to trees and water without explicitly mentioning eden . [SEP]
[CLS] the name derives from the ak ##ka ##dian " ed ##inn ##u " , from a sum ##erian word " ed ##in " meaning " plain " or " steppe " , closely related to an aramaic root word meaning " fruit ##ful , well - watered " . [SEP]
[CLS] another interpretation associates the name with a hebrew word for " pleasure " ; thus the do ##ua ##y - r ##heim ##s bible in genesis 2 : 8 has the word ##ing " and the lord god had planted a paradise of pleasure " rather than " a garden in eden " . [SEP]
[CLS] the hebrew term is translated " pleasure " in sarah ' s secret saying in . [SEP]
[CLS] like the genesis flood narrative , the genesis creation narrative and the account of the tower of babe ##l , the story of eden echoes the mesopotamia ##n myth of a king , as a pri ##mo ##rdial man , who is placed in a divine garden to guard the tree of life . [SEP]
[CLS] the hebrew bible depicts adam and eve as walking around the garden of eden naked due to their innocence . [SEP]
[CLS] the location of eden is described in the book of genesis as the source of four tributaries . [SEP]
[CLS] the garden of eden is considered to be mythological by most scholars . [SEP]
[CLS] among those that consider it to have been real , there have been various suggestions for its location : at the head of the persian gulf , in southern mesopotamia ( now iraq ) where the ti ##gr ##is and eu ##ph ##rates rivers run into the sea ; and in armenia . [SEP]
[CLS] the second part of the genesis creation narrative , , opens with y ##h ##w ##h - el ##oh ##im ( translated here " the lord god " , see names of god in judaism ) creating the first man ( adam ) , whom he placed in a garden that he planted " eastward in eden " . [SEP]
[CLS] " and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight , and good for food ; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil . " [SEP]
[CLS] the man was free to eat from any tree in the garden except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil . [SEP]
[CLS] last of all , the god made a woman ( eve ) from a rib of the man to be a companion for the man . [SEP]
[CLS] in chapter three , the man and the woman were seduce ##d by the serpent into eating the forbidden fruit , and they were expelled from the garden to prevent them from eating of the tree of life , and thus living forever . [SEP]
[CLS] cher ##ub ##im were placed east of the garden , " and a flaming sword which turned every way , to guard the way of the tree of life " . [SEP]
[CLS] according to lars - iv ##ar ring ##bo ##m the " para ##dis ##us terre ##st ##ris " is located in tak ##ab in northeastern iran . [SEP]
[CLS] in the prophet ezekiel the " son of man " sets down god ' s word against the king of tyre : the king was the " seal of perfection " , adorned with precious stones from the day of his creation , placed by god in the garden of eden on the holy mountain as a guardian cher ##ub . [SEP]
[CLS] but the king sinn ##ed through wicked ##ness and violence , and so he was driven out of the garden and thrown to the earth , where now he is consumed by god ' s fire : " all those who knew you in the nations are appalled at you , you have come to a horrible end and will be no more . " [SEP]
[CLS] according to ter ##je st ##ord ##ale ##n , the eden in ezekiel appears to be located in lebanon . [SEP]
[CLS] " it appears that the lebanon is an alternative placement in ph ##oe ##nic ##ian myth ( as in e ##z 28 , 13 , iii . 48 ) of the garden of eden " , and there are connections between paradise , the garden of eden and the forests of lebanon ( possibly used symbolic ##ally ) within prophet ##ic writings . [SEP]
[CLS] edward lip ##inski and peter kyle mcc ##arte ##r have suggested that the garden of the gods ( sum ##erian paradise ) , the oldest sum ##erian version of the garden of eden , relates to a mountain sanctuary in the lebanon and anti - lebanon ranges . [SEP]
[CLS] the garden of eden is considered to be mythological by most scholars . [SEP]
[CLS] however , there have been suggestions for its location : at its source of the rivers , while others have looked at the head of the persian gulf , in southern mesopotamia ( now iraq ) where the ti ##gr ##is and eu ##ph ##rates rivers run into the sea ; and in the armenian highlands or armenian plateau . [SEP]
[CLS] british archaeologist david ro ##hl locate ##s it in iran , and in the vicinity of tab ##riz , but this suggestion has not caught on with scholarly sources . [SEP]
[CLS] in the talmud and the jewish ka ##bba ##lah , the scholars agree that there are two types of spiritual places called " garden in eden " . [SEP]
[CLS] the first is rather terrestrial , of abundant fertility and lux ##urian ##t vegetation , known as the " lower gan eden " . [SEP]
[CLS] the second is envisioned as being celestial , the habitat ##ion of righteous , jewish and non - jewish , immortal souls , known as the " higher gan eden " . [SEP]
[CLS] the rabbis differentiate between " gan " and eden . [SEP]
[CLS] adam is said to have d ##we ##lt only in the " gan " , whereas eden is said never to be witnessed by any mortal eye . [SEP]
[CLS] according to jewish es ##cha ##tology , the higher gan eden is called the " garden of righteous ##ness " . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been created since the beginning of the world , and will appear glorious ##ly at the end of time . [SEP]
[CLS] the righteous dwelling there will enjoy the sight of the heavenly " cha ##yo ##t " carrying the throne of god . [SEP]
[CLS] each of the righteous will walk with god , who will lead them in a dance . [SEP]
[CLS] its jewish and non - jewish inhabitants are " clothed with garments of light and eternal life , and eat of the tree of life " ( enoch 58 , 3 ) near to god and his an ##oint ##ed ones . [SEP]
[CLS] this jewish rabbi ##nical concept of a higher gan eden is opposed by the hebrew terms " ge ##hin ##no ##m " and " she ##ol " , figurative names for the place of spiritual purification for the wicked dead in judaism , a place envisioned as being at the greatest possible distance from heaven . [SEP]
[CLS] in modern jewish es ##cha ##tology it is believed that history will complete itself and the ultimate destination will be when all mankind returns to the garden of eden . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 19th century book " legends of the jews " , louis gin ##z ##berg compiled jewish legends found in rabbi ##nic literature . [SEP]
[CLS] among the legends are ones about the two gardens of eden . [SEP]
[CLS] beyond paradise is the higher gan eden , where god is en ##th ##rone ##d and explains the torah to its inhabitants . [SEP]
[CLS] the higher gan eden contains three hundred ten worlds and is divided into seven compartments . [SEP]
[CLS] the compartments are not described , though it is implied that each compartment is greater than the previous one and is joined based on one ' s merit . [SEP]
[CLS] the first compartment is for jewish martyrs , the second for those who drowned , the third for " rabbi johan ##an ben za ##kka ##i and his disciples , " the fourth for those whom the cloud of glory carried off , the fifth for pen ##ite ##nts , the sixth for youths who have never sinn ##ed ; and the seventh for the poor who lived decent ##ly and studied the torah . [SEP]
[CLS] in chapter two , legends of the jews gives a brief description of the lower gan eden . [SEP]
[CLS] the tree of knowledge is a hedge around the tree of life , and it is so vast that it would take one over five hundred years to clear a path through the tree of knowledge to reach the tree of life . [SEP]
[CLS] from beneath the trees flow all the world ' s waters in the form of four rivers : ti ##gr ##is , nile , eu ##ph ##rates , and gang ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] after the fall of man , the world was no longer ir ##ri ##gated by this water . [SEP]
[CLS] while in the garden , though , adam and eve were served meat dishes by angels and the animals of the world understood human language , respected mankind as god ' s image , and feared adam and eve . [SEP]
[CLS] when one dies , one ' s soul must pass through the lower gan eden in order to reach the higher gan eden . [SEP]
[CLS] the way to the garden is the cave of mach ##pel ##ah that adam guards . [SEP]
[CLS] the cave leads to the gate of the garden , guarded by a cher ##ub with a flaming sword . [SEP]
[CLS] if a soul is un ##worthy of entering , the sword ann ##ih ##ila ##tes it . [SEP]
[CLS] within the garden is a pillar of fire and smoke that extends to the higher gan eden , which the soul must climb in order to reach the higher gan eden . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " jan ##nat ʿ ##ad ##ni " ( " gardens of eden " or " gardens of perpetual residence " ) is used in the qur ' an for the destination of the righteous . [SEP]
[CLS] there are several mentions of " the garden " in the qur ' an ( 2 : 35 , 7 : 19 , 20 : 117 ) , while the garden of eden , without the word " ʿ ##ad ##n " , is commonly the fourth layer of the islamic heaven and not necessarily thought as the dwelling place of adam . [SEP]
[CLS] the quran refers frequently over various sur ##ah about the first ab ##ode of adam and ha ##w ##wa ( eve ) , including sur ##at sad , which features 18 verses on the subject ( 38 : 71 – 88 ) , sur ##at al - ba ##qa ##ra , sur ##at al - a ' raf , and sur ##at al - hi ##j ##r although sometimes without mentioning the location . [SEP]
[CLS] the narrative mainly surrounds the resulting expulsion of ha ##w ##wa and adam after they were tempted by sha ##itan . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the biblical account , the quran mentions only one tree in eden , the tree of immortality , which god specifically claimed it was forbidden to adam and eve . [SEP]
[CLS] some ex ##ege ##sis added an account , about satan , disguised as a serpent to enter the garden , repeatedly told adam to eat from the tree , and eventually both adam and eve did so , resulting in di ##so ##bey ##ing god . [SEP]
[CLS] these stories are also featured in the had ##ith collections , including al - tab ##ari . [SEP]
[CLS] followers of the latter day saints movement ( also known as mormon ##s ) believe that after adam and eve were expelled from the garden of eden they resided in a place known as adam - on ##di - ah ##man , located in present - day davies ##s county , missouri . [SEP]
[CLS] it is recorded in the doctrine and covenant ##s that adam blessed his poster ##ity there and that he will return to that place at the time of the final judgement in fulfillment of a prophecy set forth in the book of mormon . [SEP]
[CLS] numerous early leaders of the church , including brigham young , he ##ber c . kimball , and george q . cannon , taught that the garden of eden itself was located in nearby jackson county , missouri , but there are no surviving first - hand accounts of that doctrine being taught by joseph smith himself . [SEP]
[CLS] lds doctrine is unclear as to the exact location of the garden of eden , but tradition among latter - day saints places it somewhere in the vicinity of adam - on ##di - ah ##man , or in jackson county . [SEP]
[CLS] the garden of eden motifs most frequently portrayed in illuminated manuscripts and paintings are the " sleep of adam " ( " creation of eve " ) , the " temptation of eve " by the serpent , the " fall of man " where adam takes the fruit , and the " expulsion " . [SEP]
[CLS] the id ##yl ##l of " naming day in eden " was less often depicted . [SEP]
[CLS] much of milton ' s " paradise lost " occurs in the garden of eden . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo depicted a at the garden of eden in the sis ##tine chapel ceiling . [SEP]
[CLS] in " the divine comedy " , dante places the garden at the top of mt . pu ##rga ##tory . [SEP]
[CLS] for many medieval writers , the image of the garden of eden also creates a location for human love and sexuality , often associated with the classic and medieval tr ##ope of the locus am ##oe ##nus . [SEP]
[CLS] one of oldest depictions of garden of eden is made in byzantine style in raven ##na , while the city was still under byzantine control . [SEP]
[CLS] a preserved blue mosaic is part of the mausoleum of gall ##a pl ##ac ##idia . [SEP]
[CLS] circular motifs represent flowers of the garden of eden . [SEP]
