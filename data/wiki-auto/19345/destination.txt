May is the 5th month of the year, coming between April and June.
It has 31 days.
The month of May might have been named for the Roman goddess Maia, or more likely the Roman goddess of fertility Bona Dea, whose festival was held in May.
May never begins or ends on the same day of the week as any other month.
May's flower is the Lily of the Valley.
Its birthstone is the emerald.
The meaning of the emerald is success in love.
May comes between April and June and is the fifth month of the year in the Gregorian calendar.
It is one of seven months to have 31 days.
In the older Roman calendar, May was the third month of the year.
It is a spring month in the Northern Hemisphere and an autumn month in the Southern Hemisphere.
In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of November in the other.
May is likely to have been named after the Roman goddess Maia, though there is a theory that May might have its name from the Latin "Maiores", meaning "Seniors".
The same theory suggests that June would then be named from "Iuniores", meaning "Juniors".
