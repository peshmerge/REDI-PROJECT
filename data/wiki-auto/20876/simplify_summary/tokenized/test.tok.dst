[CLS] mi ##mos ##a is a genus of about 400 species of herbs and shrubs , in the mi ##mos ##oid clade of the leg ##ume family fa ##ba ##ceae . [SEP]
[CLS] the generic name is derived from the greek word ( " mi ##mos " ) , an " actor " or " mi ##me , " and the feminine suffix â€“ " os ##a " , " resembling " , suggesting its ' sensitive leaves ' which seem to ' mimic conscious life ' . [SEP]
[CLS] two species in the genus are especially notable . [SEP]
[CLS] one is " mi ##mos ##a pu ##dic ##a " , because of the way it folds its leaves when touched or exposed to heat . [SEP]
[CLS] it is native to southern central and south america but is widely cultivated elsewhere for its curiosity value , both as a house ##pl ##ant in temperate areas , and outdoors in the tr ##op ##ics . [SEP]
[CLS] outdoor cultivation has led to weed ##y invasion in some areas , notably hawaii . [SEP]
[CLS] the other is " mi ##mos ##a ten ##ui ##fl ##ora " , which is best known for its use in shaman ##ic a ##yah ##ua ##sca brew ##s due to the psychedelic drug dime ##thy ##lt ##ry ##pta ##mine found in its root bark . [SEP]
[CLS] the taxonomy of the genus " mi ##mos ##a " has had a tor ##tu ##ous history , having gone through periods of splitting and lump ##ing , ultimately acc ##um ##ulating over 3 , 000 names , many of which have either been synonym ##ized under other species or transferred to other genera . [SEP]
[CLS] in part due to these changing ci ##rc ##ums ##cript ##ions , the name " mi ##mos ##a " has also been applied to several other related species with similar pin ##nate or bi ##pin ##nate leaves , but are now classified in other genera . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common examples of this are " al ##bi ##zia jul ##ib ##ris ##sin " ( silk tree ) and " acacia deal ##bat ##a " ( watt ##le ) . [SEP]
[CLS] members of this genus are among the few plants capable of rapid movement ; examples outside of " mi ##mos ##a " include the telegraph plant , al ##dro ##van ##da , some species of dr ##ose ##ra and the famous venus fly ##tra ##p . [SEP]
[CLS] the leaves of the mi ##mos ##a pu ##dic ##a close quickly when touched . [SEP]
[CLS] some mi ##mos ##as raise their leaves in the day and lower them at night , and experiments done by jacques d ' or ##tou ##s de mai ##ran on mi ##mos ##as in 1729 provided the first evidence of biological clocks . [SEP]
[CLS] " mi ##mos ##a " can be distinguished from the large related genera , " acacia " and " al ##bi ##zia " , since its flowers have 10 or fewer st ##amen ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] note that , botanical ##ly , what appears to be a single g ##lo ##bular flower is actually a cluster of many individual ones . [SEP]
[CLS] mi ##mos ##a contains some level of he ##pta ##no ##ic acid . [SEP]
[CLS] the bark , leaves and flowers have been used for centuries in traditional chinese medicine . [SEP]
[CLS] the bark is still known as ' collective happiness bark ' and is used for cleansing the body ' s energetic pathways ( heart and liver meridian ##s ) , allegedly providing a spiritual boost for those who take it . [SEP]
[CLS] the ancient maya ##ns also used it regularly to treat injuries and burns . [SEP]
[CLS] despite this , modern research remains surprisingly insignificant , but the powder ##ed bark is commonly used by home ##opa ##ths as an anti - inflammatory , anti - sept ##ic , cough / cold relief and pain ##kill ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] " al ##bi ##zia jul ##ib ##ris ##sin " , persian silk tree , called mi ##mos ##a in the united states [SEP]
