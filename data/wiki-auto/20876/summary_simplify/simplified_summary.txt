the taxonomy of the genus " mimosa " has gone through different periods of splitting and lumping , ultimately accumulating over 3,000 names , many of which have either been synonymized under other species or transferred to other genera .
in part due to these changing circumscriptions , the name " mimosa " has also been used for other related species with similar pinnate leaves , but are now classified in other genera .
examples outside of " mimosa " include the telegraph plant , aldrovanda , some species of drosera and the famous venus flytrap .
some mimosas raise their leaves in the day and lower them at night .
" mimosa " is related to the genera " acacia " and " albizia " .
