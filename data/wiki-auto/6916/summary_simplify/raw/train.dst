In history, a colony is a territory under the immediate complete political control and occupied by settlers of a state, distinct from the home territory of the sovereign.
In Ancient Greece, the city that founded a colony was known as the metropolis.
"Mother country" is a reference to the metropolitan state from the point of view of citizens who live in its colony.
Unlike a puppet state or satellite state, a colony has no independent international representation, and its top-level administration is under direct control of the metropolitan state.
The term "informal colony" is used by some historians to refer to a country under the "de facto" control of another state, although this term is often contentious.
Other, less obvious settlements that began as Roman colonia include cities from Belgrade to York.
A tell-tale sign of a settlement once being a Roman colony is a city centre with a grid pattern.
So colonies are not independently self-controlled, but rather are controlled from a separate entity that serves the capital function.
These were small farming settlements that appeared when the Romans had subdued an enemy in war.
Its original definition as a settlement created by people migrating from a central region to an outlying one became the modern definition.
The Special Committee on Decolonization maintains the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories, which identifies areas the United Nations (though not without controversy) believes are colonies.
Given that dependent territories have varying degrees of autonomy and political power in the affairs of the controlling state, there is disagreement over the classification of "colony".
