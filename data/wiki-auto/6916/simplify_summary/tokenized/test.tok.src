[CLS] in history , a colony is a territory under the immediate complete political control and occupied by settlers of a state , distinct from the home territory of the sovereign . [SEP]
[CLS] for colonies in antiquity , city - states would often found their own colonies . [SEP]
[CLS] some colonies were historically countries , while others were territories without definite statehood from their inception . [SEP]
[CLS] the metropolitan state is the state that rules the colony . [SEP]
[CLS] in ancient greece , the city that founded a colony was known as the metropolis . [SEP]
[CLS] " mother country " is a reference to the metropolitan state from the point of view of citizens who live in its colony . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a united nations list of non - self - governing territories . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike a puppet state or satellite state , a colony has no independent international representation , and its top - level administration is under direct control of the metropolitan state . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " informal colony " is used by some historians to refer to a country under the " de facto " control of another state , although this term is often contentious . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " colony " comes from the latin word " colon ##ia " . [SEP]
[CLS] this in turn derives from the word " colon ##us " , which means colon ##ist but also implies a farmer . [SEP]
[CLS] cologne is an example of a settlement preserving this etymology . [SEP]
[CLS] other , less obvious settlements that began as roman colon ##ia include cities from belgrade to york . [SEP]
[CLS] a tell - tale sign of a settlement once being a roman colony is a city centre with a grid pattern . [SEP]
[CLS] the terminology is taken from architectural analogy , where a column pillar is beneath the ( often stylized ) head capital , which is also a biological analog of the body as sub ##ser ##vie ##nt beneath the controlling head ( with ' capital ' coming from the latin word " cap ##ut " , meaning ' head ' ) . [SEP]
[CLS] so colonies are not independently self - controlled , but rather are controlled from a separate entity that serves the capital function . [SEP]
[CLS] roman colonies first appeared when the romans conquered neighbouring it ##alic peoples . [SEP]
[CLS] these were small farming settlements that appeared when the romans had subdued an enemy in war . [SEP]
[CLS] a colony could take many forms , as a trade outpost or a military base in enemy territory . [SEP]
[CLS] its original definition as a settlement created by people migrating from a central region to an outlying one became the modern definition . [SEP]
[CLS] the special committee on deco ##lon ##ization maintains the united nations list of non - self - governing territories , which identifies areas the united nations ( though not without controversy ) believes are colonies . [SEP]
[CLS] given that dependent territories have varying degrees of autonomy and political power in the affairs of the controlling state , there is disagreement over the classification of " colony " . [SEP]
