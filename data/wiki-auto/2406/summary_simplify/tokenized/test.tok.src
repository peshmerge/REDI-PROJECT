[CLS] alba ##n maria johannes berg ( ; ] ; february 9 , 1885 – december 24 , 1935 ) was an austrian composer of the second vie ##nne ##se school . [SEP]
[CLS] berg was more interested in literature than music as a child and did not begin to compose until he was fifteen , when he started to teach himself music . [SEP]
[CLS] berg had little formal music education before he became a student of arnold sc ##hoe ##nberg in october 1904 . [SEP]
[CLS] he also wrote songs , including his " seven early songs " ( " si ##eb ##en fr ##uh ##e lied ##er " ) , three of which were berg ' s first publicly performed work in a concert that featured the music of sc ##hoe ##nberg ' s pupils in vienna that year . [SEP]
[CLS] among sc ##hoe ##nberg ' s teaching was the idea that the unity of a musical composition depends upon all its aspects being derived from a single basic idea ; this idea was later known as " developing variation " . [SEP]
[CLS] berg passed this on to his students , one of whom , theodor w . ad ##orno , stated : " the main principle he conveyed was that of variation : everything was supposed to develop out of something else and yet be intrinsic ##ally different " . [SEP]
[CLS] the piano sonata is an example — the whole composition is derived from the work ' s opening qu ##art ##al gesture and its opening phrase . [SEP]
[CLS] berg was a part of vienna ' s cultural elite during the head ##y " fin de si ##ec ##le " period . [SEP]
[CLS] his circle included the musicians alexander von ze ##ml ##insky and franz sc ##hre ##ker , the painter gustav k ##lim ##t , the writer and sat ##iri ##st karl k ##raus , the architect adolf lo ##os , and the poet peter alt ##enberg . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1906 berg met the singer helene nah ##owski ( 1885 - 1976 ) , daughter of a wealthy family ( said by some to be in fact the illegitimate daughter of emperor franz joseph i of austria from his liaison with anna nah ##owski ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the performance caused a riot , and had to be halted . [SEP]
[CLS] after the end of world war i , he settled again in vienna , where he taught private pupils . [SEP]
[CLS] he also helped sc ##hoe ##nberg run his society for private musical performances , which sought to create the ideal environment for the exploration and appreciation of unfamiliar new music by means of open rehearsals , repeat performances , and the exclusion of professional critics . [SEP]
[CLS] various suggestions have been made as to the reason for this interest : that he took it from the bio ##rh ##yt ##hm ##s theory of wilhelm flies ##s , in which a 23 - day cycle is considered significant , or because he first suffered an asthma attack on the 23rd of the month . [SEP]
[CLS] berg made a start on his second opera , the three - act " lulu " , in 1928 but interrupted the work in 1929 for the concert aria " der wei ##n " which he completed that summer . [SEP]
[CLS] other well - known berg compositions include the " lyric suite " ( 1926 ) , which was later shown to employ elaborate cy ##pher ##s to document a secret love affair ; the post - ma ##hler ##ian " three pieces for orchestra " ( completed in 1915 but not performed until after " wo ##zz ##eck " ) ; and the chamber concerto ( " kam ##mer ##kon ##zer ##t " , 1923 – 25 ) for violin , piano , and 13 wind instruments : this latter is written so con ##sc ##ient ##iously that pierre bo ##ule ##z has called it " berg ' s strict ##est composition " and it , too , is per ##me ##ated by cy ##pher ##s and posthumously disclosed hidden programs . [SEP]
[CLS] life for the musical world was becoming increasingly difficult in the 1930s both in vienna and germany due to the rising tide of anti ##se ##mit ##ism and the nazi cultural ideology that denounced modern ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] even to have an association with someone who was jewish could lead to den ##unciation , and berg ' s " crime " was to have studied with the jewish composer arnold sc ##hoe ##nberg . [SEP]
[CLS] berg found that opportunities for his work to be performed in germany were becoming rare , and eventually his music was pro ##scribe ##d and placed on the list of de ##gen ##erate music . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1932 berg and his wife acquired an isolated lodge , the " wal ##dha ##us " on the southern shore of the worth ##ers ##ee , near sc ##hi ##ef ##ling am see in car ##int ##hia , where he was able to work in sec ##lusion , mainly on " lulu " and the violin concerto . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of 1934 , berg became involved in the political int ##rigues around finding a replacement for clemens k ##raus ##s as director of the vienna state opera . [SEP]
[CLS] as more of the performances of his work in germany were cancelled by the nazis , who had come to power in early 1933 , he needed to ensure the new director would be an advocate for modernist music . [SEP]
[CLS] originally , the premiere of " lulu " had been planned for the berlin state opera , where erich k ##lei ##ber continued to champion his music and had conducted the premiere of " wo ##zz ##eck " in 1925 , but now this was looking increasingly uncertain , and " lulu " was rejected by the berlin authorities in the spring of 1934 . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##lei ##ber ' s production of the " lulu " symphonic suite on 30 november 1934 in berlin was also the occasion of his resignation in protest at the extent of con ##fl ##ation of culture with politics . [SEP]
[CLS] like much of his mature work , it employs an id ##ios ##yn ##cratic adaptation of sc ##hoe ##nberg ' s " dod ##eca ##phonic " or twelve - tone technique , that enables the composer to produce passages openly ev ##oki ##ng ton ##ality , including quota ##tions from historical ton ##al music , such as a bach chorale and a car ##int ##hian folk song . [SEP]
[CLS] the violin concerto was dedicated " to the memory of an angel " , man ##on gr ##op ##ius , the deceased daughter of architect walter gr ##op ##ius and alma ma ##hler . [SEP]
[CLS] for personal reasons helene berg subsequently imposed a ban on any attempt to " complete " the final act , which berg had in fact completed in short score . [SEP]
[CLS] the complete opera has rapidly entered the repertoire as one of the landmarks of contemporary music and , like " wo ##zz ##eck " , remains a consistent audience draw . [SEP]
[CLS] berg is remembered as one of the most important composers of the 20th century and the most widely performed opera composer among the second vie ##nne ##se school . [SEP]
[CLS] critically , he is seen as having preserved the vie ##nne ##se tradition in his music . [SEP]
[CLS] berg scholar douglas jar ##man writes in the " new grove dictionary of music and musicians " that " as the 20th century closed , the ' backward - looking ' berg suddenly came as george per ##le remarked , to look like its most forward - looking composer . " [SEP]
