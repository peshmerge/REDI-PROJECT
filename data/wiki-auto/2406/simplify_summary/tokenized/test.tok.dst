[CLS] alba ##n maria johannes berg ( ; ] ; february 9 , 1885 – december 24 , 1935 ) was an austrian composer of the second vie ##nne ##se school . [SEP]
[CLS] his composition ##al style combined romantic lyric ##ism with twelve - tone technique . [SEP]
[CLS] berg was born in vienna , the third of four children of johanna and konrad berg . [SEP]
[CLS] his family lived comfortably until the death of his father in 1900 . [SEP]
[CLS] berg was more interested in literature than music as a child and did not begin to compose until he was fifteen , when he started to teach himself music . [SEP]
[CLS] with marie sc ##he ##uch ##l , a maid fifteen years his senior in the berg family household , he father ##ed a daughter , al ##bine , born december 4 , 1902 . [SEP]
[CLS] berg had little formal music education before he became a student of arnold sc ##hoe ##nberg in october 1904 . [SEP]
[CLS] with sc ##hoe ##nberg , he studied counter ##point , music theory , and harmony . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1906 he was studying music full - time ; by 1907 he began composition lessons . [SEP]
[CLS] his student compositions included five drafts for piano sonata ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] he also wrote songs , including his " seven early songs " ( " si ##eb ##en fr ##uh ##e lied ##er " ) , three of which were berg ' s first publicly performed work in a concert that featured the music of sc ##hoe ##nberg ' s pupils in vienna that year . [SEP]
[CLS] the early sonata sketches eventually culminated in berg ' s piano sonata , op . 1 ( 1907 – 1908 ) ; it is one of the most formidable " first " works ever written . [SEP]
[CLS] berg studied with sc ##hoe ##nberg for six years until 1911 . [SEP]
[CLS] among sc ##hoe ##nberg ' s teaching was the idea that the unity of a musical composition depends upon all its aspects being derived from a single basic idea ; this idea was later known as " developing variation " . [SEP]
[CLS] berg passed this on to his students , one of whom , theodor w . ad ##orno , stated : " the main principle he conveyed was that of variation : everything was supposed to develop out of something else and yet be intrinsic ##ally different " . [SEP]
[CLS] the piano sonata is an example — the whole composition is derived from the work ' s opening qu ##art ##al gesture and its opening phrase . [SEP]
[CLS] berg was a part of vienna ' s cultural elite during the head ##y " fin de si ##ec ##le " period . [SEP]
[CLS] his circle included the musicians alexander von ze ##ml ##insky and franz sc ##hre ##ker , the painter gustav k ##lim ##t , the writer and sat ##iri ##st karl k ##raus , the architect adolf lo ##os , and the poet peter alt ##enberg . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1906 berg met the singer helene nah ##owski ( 1885 - 1976 ) , daughter of a wealthy family ( said by some to be in fact the illegitimate daughter of emperor franz joseph i of austria from his liaison with anna nah ##owski ) . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the outward hostility of her family , the two were married on may 3 , 1911 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1913 two of berg ' s " alt ##enberg lied ##er " ( 1912 ) were premiered in vienna , conducted by sc ##hoe ##nberg in the infamous " ska ##nda ##lk ##on ##zer ##t " . [SEP]
[CLS] settings of ap ##hor ##istic poetic utter ##ances , the songs are accompanied by a very large orchestra . [SEP]
[CLS] the performance caused a riot , and had to be halted . [SEP]
[CLS] he effectively withdrew the work , and it was not performed in full until 1952 . [SEP]
[CLS] the full score remained unpublished until 1966 . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1915 – 18 , berg served in the austro - hungarian army and during a period of leave in 1917 , he accelerated work on his first opera , " wo ##zz ##eck " . [SEP]
[CLS] after the end of world war i , he settled again in vienna , where he taught private pupils . [SEP]
[CLS] he also helped sc ##hoe ##nberg run his society for private musical performances , which sought to create the ideal environment for the exploration and appreciation of unfamiliar new music by means of open rehearsals , repeat performances , and the exclusion of professional critics . [SEP]
[CLS] berg had a particular interest in the number 23 , using it to structure several works . [SEP]
[CLS] various suggestions have been made as to the reason for this interest : that he took it from the bio ##rh ##yt ##hm ##s theory of wilhelm flies ##s , in which a 23 - day cycle is considered significant , or because he first suffered an asthma attack on the 23rd of the month . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1924 three excerpts from " wo ##zz ##eck " were performed , which brought berg his first public success . [SEP]
[CLS] the opera , which berg completed in 1922 , was first performed on december 14 , 1925 , when erich k ##lei ##ber conducted the first performance in berlin . [SEP]
[CLS] today , " wo ##zz ##eck " is seen as one of the century ' s most important works . [SEP]
[CLS] berg made a start on his second opera , the three - act " lulu " , in 1928 but interrupted the work in 1929 for the concert aria " der wei ##n " which he completed that summer . [SEP]
[CLS] " der wei ##n " pre ##sa ##ged " lulu " in a number of ways , including vocal style , orchestra ##tion , design and text . [SEP]
[CLS] other well - known berg compositions include the " lyric suite " ( 1926 ) , which was later shown to employ elaborate cy ##pher ##s to document a secret love affair ; the post - ma ##hler ##ian " three pieces for orchestra " ( completed in 1915 but not performed until after " wo ##zz ##eck " ) ; and the chamber concerto ( " kam ##mer ##kon ##zer ##t " , 1923 – 25 ) for violin , piano , and 13 wind instruments : this latter is written so con ##sc ##ient ##iously that pierre bo ##ule ##z has called it " berg ' s strict ##est composition " and it , too , is per ##me ##ated by cy ##pher ##s and posthumously disclosed hidden programs . [SEP]
[CLS] life for the musical world was becoming increasingly difficult in the 1930s both in vienna and germany due to the rising tide of anti ##se ##mit ##ism and the nazi cultural ideology that denounced modern ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] even to have an association with someone who was jewish could lead to den ##unciation , and berg ' s " crime " was to have studied with the jewish composer arnold sc ##hoe ##nberg . [SEP]
[CLS] berg found that opportunities for his work to be performed in germany were becoming rare , and eventually his music was pro ##scribe ##d and placed on the list of de ##gen ##erate music . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1932 berg and his wife acquired an isolated lodge , the " wal ##dha ##us " on the southern shore of the worth ##ers ##ee , near sc ##hi ##ef ##ling am see in car ##int ##hia , where he was able to work in sec ##lusion , mainly on " lulu " and the violin concerto . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of 1934 , berg became involved in the political int ##rigues around finding a replacement for clemens k ##raus ##s as director of the vienna state opera . [SEP]
[CLS] as more of the performances of his work in germany were cancelled by the nazis , who had come to power in early 1933 , he needed to ensure the new director would be an advocate for modernist music . [SEP]
[CLS] originally , the premiere of " lulu " had been planned for the berlin state opera , where erich k ##lei ##ber continued to champion his music and had conducted the premiere of " wo ##zz ##eck " in 1925 , but now this was looking increasingly uncertain , and " lulu " was rejected by the berlin authorities in the spring of 1934 . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##lei ##ber ' s production of the " lulu " symphonic suite on 30 november 1934 in berlin was also the occasion of his resignation in protest at the extent of con ##fl ##ation of culture with politics . [SEP]
[CLS] even in vienna , the opportunities for the vienna school of musicians was d ##wind ##ling . [SEP]
[CLS] berg had interrupted the orchestra ##tion of " lulu " because of an unexpected ( and financially much - needed ) commission from the russian - american violinist louis k ##ras ##ner for a violin concerto ( 1935 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this profoundly el ##eg ##iac work , composed at una ##ccus ##tom ##ed speed and posthumously premiered , has become berg ' s best - known and most - beloved composition . [SEP]
[CLS] like much of his mature work , it employs an id ##ios ##yn ##cratic adaptation of sc ##hoe ##nberg ' s " dod ##eca ##phonic " or twelve - tone technique , that enables the composer to produce passages openly ev ##oki ##ng ton ##ality , including quota ##tions from historical ton ##al music , such as a bach chorale and a car ##int ##hian folk song . [SEP]
[CLS] the violin concerto was dedicated " to the memory of an angel " , man ##on gr ##op ##ius , the deceased daughter of architect walter gr ##op ##ius and alma ma ##hler . [SEP]
[CLS] berg died aged 50 in vienna , on christmas eve 1935 , from blood poisoning apparently caused by a fur ##un ##cle on his back , induced by an insect sting that occurred in november . [SEP]
[CLS] before he died , berg had completed the orchestra ##tion of only the first two of the three acts of " lulu " . [SEP]
[CLS] the completed acts were successfully premiered in zurich in 1937 . [SEP]
[CLS] for personal reasons helene berg subsequently imposed a ban on any attempt to " complete " the final act , which berg had in fact completed in short score . [SEP]
[CLS] an orchestra ##tion was therefore commissioned in secret from friedrich ce ##rh ##a and premiered in paris ( under pierre bo ##ule ##z ) only in 1979 , soon after helene berg ' s own death . [SEP]
[CLS] the complete opera has rapidly entered the repertoire as one of the landmarks of contemporary music and , like " wo ##zz ##eck " , remains a consistent audience draw . [SEP]
[CLS] berg is remembered as one of the most important composers of the 20th century and the most widely performed opera composer among the second vie ##nne ##se school . [SEP]
[CLS] he is said to have brought more " human values " to the twelve - tone system , his works seen as more " emotional " than sc ##hoe ##nberg ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] critically , he is seen as having preserved the vie ##nne ##se tradition in his music . [SEP]
[CLS] berg scholar douglas jar ##man writes in the " new grove dictionary of music and musicians " that " as the 20th century closed , the ' backward - looking ' berg suddenly came as george per ##le remarked , to look like its most forward - looking composer . " [SEP]
[CLS] the asteroid 45 ##28 berg is named after him ( 1983 ) . [SEP]
