[CLS] a cartel is a group of apparently independent producers whose goal is to increase their collective profits by means of price fixing , limiting supply , or other restrictive practices . [SEP]
[CLS] cartel ##s typically control selling prices , but some are organized to force down the prices of purchased inputs . [SEP]
[CLS] anti ##trust laws attempt to deter or forbid cartel ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] a single entity that holds a monopoly by this definition cannot be a cartel , though it may be guilty of abu ##sing said monopoly in other ways . [SEP]
[CLS] cartel ##s usually arise in ol ##igo ##pol ##ies — industries with a small number of sellers — and usually involve homogeneous products . [SEP]
[CLS] in general , cartel ##s can be divided into domestic and international agreements . [SEP]
[CLS] export cartel ##s constitute a special case of international cartel ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike other cartel ##s , export cartel ##s are legal in virtually all jurisdictions , despite their harmful effects on affected markets . [SEP]
[CLS] bid rig ##ging is a special type of cartel in which bid ##ders for a tender agree on a bid price , agree not to bid , or agree to share the objects of the winning bid among themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] a survey of hundreds of published economic studies and legal decisions of anti ##trust authorities found that the median price increase achieved by cartel ##s in the last 200 years is about 23 percent . [SEP]
[CLS] private international cartel ##s ( those with participants from two or more nations ) had an average price increase of 28 percent , whereas domestic cartel ##s averaged 18 percent . [SEP]
[CLS] less than 10 percent of all cartel ##s in the sample failed to raise market prices . [SEP]
[CLS] in general , cartel agreements are economically unstable in that there is an incentive for members to cheat by selling at below the agreed price or selling more than the production quota ##s set by the cartel ( see also game theory ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this has caused many cartel ##s that attempt to set product prices to be unsuccessful in the long term . [SEP]
[CLS] empirical studies of 20th - century cartel ##s have determined that the mean duration of discovered cartel ##s is from 5 to 8 years . [SEP]
[CLS] however , once a cartel is broken , the incentives to form the cartel return and the cartel may be re - formed . [SEP]
[CLS] publicly known cartel ##s that do not follow this cycle include , by some accounts , the organization of the petroleum export ##ing countries ( op ##ec ) . [SEP]
[CLS] price fixing is often practiced internationally . [SEP]
[CLS] when the agreement to control price is sanctioned by a multi ##lateral treaty or protected by national sovereignty , no anti ##trust actions may be initiated . [SEP]
[CLS] examples of such price fixing include oil , whose price is partly controlled by the supply by op ##ec countries , and international airline tickets , which have prices fixed by agreement with the iata , a practice for which there is a specific exception in anti ##trust law . [SEP]
[CLS] prior to world war ii ( except in the united states ) , members of cartel ##s could sign contracts that were enforce ##able in courts of law . [SEP]
[CLS] there were even instances where cartel ##s are encouraged by states . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , during the period before 1945 , cartel ##s were tolerated in europe and were promoted as a business practice in german - speaking countries . [SEP]
[CLS] this was the norm due to the accepted benefits , which even the u . s . supreme court has noted . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case , " the " " u . s . v . national lead co . et al . " , it cited the testimony of individuals , who cited that a cartel , in its pro ##tea ##n form , is " a combination of producers for the purpose of regulating production and , frequently , prices , and an association by agreement of companies or sections of companies having common interests so as to prevent extreme or unfair competition . " [SEP]
[CLS] today , however , price fixing by private entities is illegal under the anti ##trust laws of more than 140 countries . [SEP]
[CLS] examples of prosecuted international cartel ##s are l ##ys ##ine , ci ##tric acid , graph ##ite electrode ##s , and bulk vitamin ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this is highlighted in countries with market economies wherein price - fixing and the concept of cartel ##s are considered in ##imi ##cal to free and fair competition , which is considered the backbone of political democracy . [SEP]
[CLS] the current condition makes it increasingly difficult for cartel ##s to maintain sustainable operations . [SEP]
[CLS] even if international cartel ##s might be out of reach for the regulatory authorities , they will still have to contend with the fact that their activities in domestic markets will be affected . [SEP]
[CLS] op ##ec : as its name suggests , op ##ec is organized by sovereign states . [SEP]
[CLS] the traditional view holds that it cannot be held to anti ##trust enforcement in other jurisdictions by virtue of the doctrine of state immunity under public international law . [SEP]
[CLS] op ##ec serves as an example of state en ##tangle ##ment in anti ##com ##pet ##itive conduct . [SEP]
[CLS] many trade associations , especially in industries dominated by only a few major companies , have been accused of being fronts for cartel ##s or facilitating secret meetings among cartel members . [SEP]
[CLS] a notable historical example is the now defunct swiss cheese union , which discouraged competition throughout the dairy industry in 20th century switzerland . [SEP]
[CLS] although cartel ##s are usually thought of as a group of corporations , the free - market economist charles w . baird considers trade unions to be cartel ##s , as they seek to raise the price of labor ( wages ) by preventing competition . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , negotiated cartel ##ism is a labor arrangement in which labor prices are held above the market clearing level through union leverage over employers . [SEP]
[CLS] an example of a new international cartel is the one created by the members of the asian racing federation and documented in the good neighbor policy signed on september 1 , 2003 . [SEP]
