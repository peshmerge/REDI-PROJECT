Tempera (] ), also known as egg tempera, is a permanent, fast-drying painting medium consisting of colored pigments mixed with a water-soluble binder medium, usually glutinous material such as egg yolk.
Tempera also refers to the paintings done in this medium.
Tempera paintings are very long lasting, and examples from the first century CE still exist.
Egg tempera was a primary method of painting until after 1500 when it was superseded by the invention of oil painting.
A paint consisting of pigment and binder commonly used in the United States as poster paint is also often referred to as "tempera paint," although the binders in this paint are different from traditional tempera paint.
A related technique has been used also in ancient and early medieval paintings found in several caves and rock-cut temples of India.
The art technique was known from the classical world, where it appears to have taken over from encaustic painting and was the main medium used for panel painting and illuminated manuscripts in the Byzantine world and Medieval and Early renaissance Europe.
Tempera painting was the primary panel painting medium for nearly every painter in the European Medieval and Early renaissance period up to 1500.
Oil paint, which may have originated in Afghanistan between the 5th and 9th centuries and migrated westward in the Middle Ages eventually superseded tempera.
Oil replaced tempera as the principal medium used for creating artwork during the 15th century in Early Netherlandish painting in northern Europe.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, there were intermittent revivals of tempera technique in Western art, among the Pre-Raphaelites, Social Realists, and others.
Tempera painting continues to be used in Greece and Russia where it is the traditional medium for Orthodox icons.
Tempera is traditionally created by hand-grinding dry powdered pigments into a binding agent or "medium", such as egg yolk, milk (in the form of casein) and a variety of plant gums.
The white of the egg and the membrane of the yolk are discarded (the membrane of the yolk is dangled over a receptacle and punctured to drain off the liquid inside).
Egg yolk is rarely used by itself with pigment; it dries almost immediately and can crack when it is dry.
Powdered pigment, or pigment that has been ground in distilled water, is placed onto a palette or bowl and mixed with a roughly equal volume of the binder.
When used to paint icons on church walls, liquid myrrh is sometimes added to the mixture to give the paint a pleasing odor, particularly as worshipers may find the egg tempera somewhat pungent for quite some time after completion.
As tempera dries, the artist will add more water to preserve the consistency and to balance the thickening of the yolk on contact with air.
Some of the pigments used by medieval painters, such as cinnabar (contains mercury), orpiment (contains arsenic), or lead white (contains lead) are highly toxic.
Most artists today use modern synthetic pigments, which are less toxic but have similar color properties to the older pigments.
Even so, many (if not most) modern pigments are still dangerous unless certain precautions are taken; these include keeping pigments wet in storage to avoid breathing their dust.
Tempera painting allows for great precision when used with traditional techniques that require the application of numerous small brush strokes applied in a cross-hatching technique.
Because it cannot be applied in thick layers as oil paints can, tempera paintings rarely have the deep color saturation that oil paintings can achieve because it can hold less pigment (lower pigment load).
In this respect, the colors of an unvarnished tempera painting resemble a pastel, although the color deepens if a varnish is applied.
On the other hand, tempera colors do not change over time, whereas oil paints darken, yellow, and become transparent with age.
Tempera adheres best to an absorbent ground that has a lower oil content than the tempera binder used (the traditional rule of thumb is ""fat over lean"", and never the other way around).
Historically wood panels were used as the substrate, and more recently un-tempered masonite, later MDF (medium density fiber, but NO Formalin treated] and modern composite boards have been employed.
Apart from the traditional process of mixing pigment with egg yolk, new methods include egg tempera sold in tubes by manufacturers such as Sennelier and Daler-Rowney.
Although tempera has been out of favor since the Late Renaissance and Baroque eras, it has been periodically rediscovered by later artists such as William Blake, the Nazarenes, the Pre-Raphaelites, and Joseph Southall.
The 20th century saw a significant revival of tempera.
European painters who worked with tempera include Giorgio de Chirico, Otto Dix, Eliot Hodgkin, Pyke Koch, and Pietro Annigoni, who used an emulsion of egg yolks, stand oil and varnish.
The tempera medium was used by American artists such as the Regionalists Andrew Wyeth, Thomas Hart Benton and his student Roger Medearis; expressionists Ben Shahn, Mitchell Siporin and John Langley Howard, magic realists George Tooker, Paul Cadmus, Jared French, Julia Thecla and Louise E. Marianetti; Art Students League of New York instructors Kenneth Hayes Miller and William C. Palmer, Social Realists Kyra Markham, Isabel Bishop, Reginald Marsh, and Noel Rockmore, Edward Laning, Anton Refregier, Jacob Lawrence, Rudolph F. Zallinger, Robert Vickrey, Peter Hurd, and science fiction artist John Schoenherr, notable as the cover artist of "Dune".
In the early part of the 20th century, a large number of Indian artists, notably of Bengal school took up tempera as one of their primary media of expression.
After the 1950s, artists such as Jamini Roy and Ganesh Pyne established tempera as a medium for the new age artists of India.
