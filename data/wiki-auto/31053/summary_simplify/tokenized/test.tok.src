[CLS] temper ##a ( ] ) , also known as egg temper ##a , is a permanent , fast - drying painting medium consisting of colored pigment ##s mixed with a water - soluble bind ##er medium , usually g ##lu ##tino ##us material such as egg yo ##lk . [SEP]
[CLS] temper ##a also refers to the paintings done in this medium . [SEP]
[CLS] temper ##a paintings are very long lasting , and examples from the first century ce still exist . [SEP]
[CLS] egg temper ##a was a primary method of painting until after 1500 when it was superseded by the invention of oil painting . [SEP]
[CLS] a paint consisting of pigment and bind ##er commonly used in the united states as poster paint is also often referred to as " temper ##a paint , " although the bind ##ers in this paint are different from traditional temper ##a paint . [SEP]
[CLS] a related technique has been used also in ancient and early medieval paintings found in several caves and rock - cut temples of india . [SEP]
[CLS] the art technique was known from the classical world , where it appears to have taken over from en ##ca ##ust ##ic painting and was the main medium used for panel painting and illuminated manuscripts in the byzantine world and medieval and early renaissance europe . [SEP]
[CLS] temper ##a painting was the primary panel painting medium for nearly every painter in the european medieval and early renaissance period up to 1500 . [SEP]
[CLS] oil paint , which may have originated in afghanistan between the 5th and 9th centuries and migrated westward in the middle ages eventually superseded temper ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] oil replaced temper ##a as the principal medium used for creating artwork during the 15th century in early net ##her ##land ##ish painting in northern europe . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 19th and 20th centuries , there were intermittent revival ##s of temper ##a technique in western art , among the pre - raphael ##ites , social real ##ists , and others . [SEP]
[CLS] temper ##a painting continues to be used in greece and russia where it is the traditional medium for orthodox icons . [SEP]
[CLS] temper ##a is traditionally created by hand - grinding dry powder ##ed pigment ##s into a binding agent or " medium " , such as egg yo ##lk , milk ( in the form of case ##in ) and a variety of plant gum ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the white of the egg and the membrane of the yo ##lk are discarded ( the membrane of the yo ##lk is dan ##gled over a rec ##ept ##acle and pun ##cture ##d to drain off the liquid inside ) . [SEP]
[CLS] egg yo ##lk is rarely used by itself with pigment ; it dr ##ies almost immediately and can crack when it is dry . [SEP]
[CLS] powder ##ed pigment , or pigment that has been ground in di ##sti ##lled water , is placed onto a palette or bowl and mixed with a roughly equal volume of the bind ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] when used to paint icons on church walls , liquid my ##rr ##h is sometimes added to the mixture to give the paint a pleasing odor , particularly as worship ##ers may find the egg temper ##a somewhat pun ##gent for quite some time after completion . [SEP]
[CLS] as temper ##a dr ##ies , the artist will add more water to preserve the consistency and to balance the thick ##ening of the yo ##lk on contact with air . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the pigment ##s used by medieval painters , such as ci ##nna ##bar ( contains mercury ) , or ##pi ##ment ( contains arsenic ) , or lead white ( contains lead ) are highly toxic . [SEP]
[CLS] most artists today use modern synthetic pigment ##s , which are less toxic but have similar color properties to the older pigment ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] even so , many ( if not most ) modern pigment ##s are still dangerous unless certain precautions are taken ; these include keeping pigment ##s wet in storage to avoid breathing their dust . [SEP]
[CLS] temper ##a painting allows for great precision when used with traditional techniques that require the application of numerous small brush strokes applied in a cross - hatch ##ing technique . [SEP]
[CLS] because it cannot be applied in thick layers as oil paints can , temper ##a paintings rarely have the deep color sat ##uration that oil paintings can achieve because it can hold less pigment ( lower pigment load ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in this respect , the colors of an un ##var ##nished temper ##a painting resemble a paste ##l , although the color deep ##ens if a var ##nish is applied . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , temper ##a colors do not change over time , whereas oil paints dark ##en , yellow , and become transparent with age . [SEP]
[CLS] temper ##a adhere ##s best to an absorb ##ent ground that has a lower oil content than the temper ##a bind ##er used ( the traditional rule of thumb is " " fat over lean " " , and never the other way around ) . [SEP]
[CLS] historically wood panels were used as the substrate , and more recently un - tempered mason ##ite , later md ##f ( medium density fiber , but no formal ##in treated ] and modern composite boards have been employed . [SEP]
[CLS] apart from the traditional process of mixing pigment with egg yo ##lk , new methods include egg temper ##a sold in tubes by manufacturers such as sen ##nel ##ier and dale ##r - row ##ney . [SEP]
[CLS] although temper ##a has been out of favor since the late renaissance and baroque eras , it has been periodically rediscovered by later artists such as william blake , the na ##zar ##enes , the pre - raphael ##ites , and joseph south ##all . [SEP]
[CLS] the 20th century saw a significant revival of temper ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] european painters who worked with temper ##a include giorgio de chi ##ric ##o , otto di ##x , eliot ho ##d ##g ##kin , p ##yk ##e koch , and pietro ann ##igo ##ni , who used an em ##ulsion of egg yo ##lk ##s , stand oil and var ##nish . [SEP]
[CLS] the temper ##a medium was used by american artists such as the regional ##ists andrew w ##ye ##th , thomas hart benton and his student roger med ##ear ##is ; expression ##ists ben shah ##n , mitchell sip ##orin and john langley howard , magic real ##ists george took ##er , paul cad ##mus , jared french , julia the ##cl ##a and louise e . marian ##etti ; art students league of new york instructors kenneth hayes miller and william c . palmer , social real ##ists ky ##ra markham , isabel bishop , reginald marsh , and noel rock ##more , edward lan ##ing , anton ref ##re ##gie ##r , jacob lawrence , rudolph f . za ##lling ##er , robert vic ##kr ##ey , peter hu ##rd , and science fiction artist john sc ##hoe ##nh ##er ##r , notable as the cover artist of " dune " . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early part of the 20th century , a large number of indian artists , notably of bengal school took up temper ##a as one of their primary media of expression . [SEP]
[CLS] after the 1950s , artists such as jam ##ini roy and gan ##esh p ##yne established temper ##a as a medium for the new age artists of india . [SEP]
