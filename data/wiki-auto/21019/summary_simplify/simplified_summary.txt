he was considered by many the greatest artist of his lifetime .
the city of florence is one of the most important centre of the arts and learning .
in the 15th century , the architect filippo brunelleschi , had studied the remains of classical buildings in rome .
the outside niches of the church of orsanmichele contained a gallery of works by the most famous sculptors of florence : donatello , ghiberti , andrea del verrocchio , and nanni di banco .

michelangelo studied the robust reliefs carved by jacopo della quercia around main portal of the basilica of st petronius .
the city was no longer in danger as charles viii had defeats .
during the half year he spent in florence , he worked on two small statues , a child " st . john the baptist " and a sleeping " cupid " .
michelangelo asked michelangelo " fix it so that it looked like it so that it looked like it so that it could " send it to rome . . pass it off as an ancient work and . . . . sell it much better . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
both lorenzo and michelangelo were cheated out of the real value of the work by a middleman .
this was so successful in selling his sculpture abroad as well as the conservative florentine situation may have encouraged michelangelo to accept the invitation of the bishop .
on 4 july of the same year , he began work on a commission for cardinal raffaele riario , an over-life-sized statue of the roman wine god " bacchus " .
after the work was finished , the work was rejected by the cardinal .
in november 1497 , the french ambassador to the holy see , cardinal jean de bilheres-lagraulas , commissioned him to carve a " pieta " , a sculpture showing the virgin mary grieving over the body of jesus .
the subject was common in religious sculpture of medieval europe .
it was soon to be thought as one of the world 's great masterpieces of sculpture , " a revelation of all the potentialities and force of the art of sculpture " .
vasari said that " it is certainly a miracle that a formless block of stone could have been reduced to a perfection that nature is scarcely able to create in the flesh . "

bramante , who was working on the building of st . peter 's basilica , resented michelangelo 's commission for the pope 's tomb .
michelangelo was originally to paint the twelve apostles on the ceiling .
michelangelo persuaded pope julius to give him a free hand .
the book of genesis is divided into three groups : god 's creation of the earth , god 's creation of humankind and their fall from god 's grace , and lastly , the state of humanity as represented by noah and his family .
on the pendentives supporting the ceiling are painted twelve men and women who prophesied the coming of jesus , seven prophets of israel , and five sibyls , prophetic women of the classical world .
adam , adam and eve are the most famous paintings on the ceiling .
he was asked to paint the marble in florence to be there .
he agreed reluctantly and spent three years creating drawings and models for the facade , as well as attempting to open a new marble quarry at pietrasanta .
in 1520 , the medici came back to michelangelo .
michelangelo used michelangelo to create the medici chapel , which houses the tombs of two of the younger members of the medici family , giuliano , duke of nemours , and lorenzo , his nephew .
the tombs display statues of the two medici and allegorical figures representing night and day , and dusk and dawn .

cardinal carafa and monsignor serninivius mantua 's ambassador abroad campaigned to have the fresco removed or censored , but the pope resisted .
in 1564 , michelangelo 's nephew , edward michelangelo , took the place of michelangelo 's genitals and daniele da volterra , an apprentice of michelangelo .
michelangelo worked hard at the statue .
they included a design for the capitoline hill with its trapezoid piazza displaying the ancient bronze statue of marcus aurelius .
he designed the upper floor of the palazzo farnese and the interior of the church of santa maria degli angeli .
other architectural works include san giovanni fiorentini , the sforza chapelicative capella sforzadillytt in the basilica di santa maria maggiore and the porta pia .
like the " last judgement " , these two works are complex compositions with many figures .
he developed his ideas for a centrally planned church , strengthening the structure both physically and visually .
michelangelo was worried that michelangelo would pass away before the dome was finished .
once building started on the lower part of the dome , the supporting ring was finished .
michelangelo was abstemious in his personal life .
he may not have minded , since he was a solitary and melancholy person , " bizzarro e fantastico , " a man who " withdrew himself from the company of men . "
it is impossible to know whether michelangelo had physical relationships between michelangelo and his wife , and that the nature of his sexuality is made apparent in his poetry .
michelangelo met cecchino dei bracci in 1542 .
some of the objects of michelangelo 's affections , and subjects of his poetry , took advantage of him .
the poetry is a source of discomfort to later generations .
michelangelo was in rome in 1536 or 1538 .
they wrote sonnets for each other .
it is carved in shallow relief .
the child shows a twisting motion that was to become characteristic of michelangelo 's work .
the " bruges madonna " was , at the time of its creation , unlike other such statues depicting the virgin proudly presenting her son .
the " doni tondo " , depicting the holy family , has elements of all three previous works : the frieze of figures in the background has the appearance of a low-relief , while the circular shape and dynamic forms echo the taddeo tondo .
michelangelo was to employ the paintings on the ceiling of the sistine chapel .
the kneeling angel is an early work in the church .
the two angels form a pair of beautiful men , but there is a great contrast between the two works .
the sculpture has all the traditional attributes , a vine wreath , a cup of wine and a fawn .
the work is dangerously inspired by classical sculpture .

michelangelo used the way he saw in the rock .
the ceiling is a flattened barrel vault .
michelangelo was not willing to take the job .
the story of the book of genesis is nine panels illustrating episodes from the book of genesis , set in an architectonic frame .

michelangelo made the figures larger .
one of the central images , " the creation of adam " is one of the best known and most reproduced works in the history of art .
as the model for the creator , michelangelo has depicted himself in the action of painting the ceiling .
michelangelo painted twenty youths who have variously been interpreted as angels , as muses , or simply as decoration .
michelangelo made studies of the ceiling , and michelangelo made studies for different figures .
michelangelo 's relief of the " battle of the centaurs " , created while he was still a youth associated with the medici academy , is an unusually complex relief in that it shows a great number of figures involved in a vigorous struggle .
such a complex disarray of figures was rare in florentine art , where it would usually only be found in images showing either the massacre of innocents or the torments of hell .
the relief treatment , in which some of the figures are boldly projecting , may indicate michelangelo 's familiarity with roman sarcophagus reliefs from the collection of lorenzo medici , and similar marble panels created by nicola and giovanni pisano , and with the figurative compositions on ghiberti 's baptistry doors .
the composition of the " battle of cascina " , is known only from copies , as the original cartoon , was so admired that it got deteriorated and was eventually in pieces .
it reflects the earlier relief in the energy and diversity of the figures , with many different postures , and many being viewed from the back , as they turn towards the approaching enemy and prepare for battle .
melozzo 's majestic figure of christ , with windblown cloak , shows a degree of foreshortening of the figure that had also been employed by andrea mantegna , but was not usual in the frescos of florentine painters .
michelangelo had the opportunity to depict , on an unprecedented scale , figures in the action of either rising heavenward or falling and being dragged down .
michelangelo is known for writing a fresco in the " the crucifixion of st . peter " .
in the crucifixion of peter soldiers busy themselves about their assigned duty of digging a post hole and raising the cross while various people look on and discuss the events .
a group of horrified women cluster in the foreground .
later , pope clement vii commissioned him to design the medici chapel and the tombs of giuliano and lorenzo medici .
michelangelo also designed the extraordinary vestibule with columns recessed into niches , and a staircase that appears to spill out of the library like a flow of lava .

michelangelo is one of the three greatest painters of the renaissance .

michelangelo 's " david " is the most famous male nude of all time .
michelangelo 's foyer of the laurentian library was one of the earliest buildings to use classical forms in a plastic .
the dome of st peter 's was to influence the building of churches for many centuries , including the church of st . peter .
artists who were directly influenced by michelangelo include raphael , whose monumental treatment of the figure in the " school of athens " and " the expulsion of heliodorus from the temple " owes much to michelangelo , and whose fresco of " isaiah " in sant ' agostino closely imitates the older master 's prophets .
other artists , such as pontormo , drew on the writhing forms of the " last judgement " and the frescoes of the capella paolina .
the sistine chapel ceiling was a work of unprecedented grandeur , both for its architectonic forms , to be copied by many baroque ceiling painters , and also for the wealth of its inventiveness in the study of figures .
