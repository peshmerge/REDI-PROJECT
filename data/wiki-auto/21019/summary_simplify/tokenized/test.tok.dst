[CLS] michelangelo di lo ##do ##vic ##o bu ##ona ##rro ##ti simon ##i ( ] ; 6 march 147 ##5 â€“ 18 february 156 ##4 ) , known best as simply michelangelo , was an italian sculptor , painter , architect and poet of the high renaissance born in the republic of florence , who ex ##erted an un ##para ##lle ##led influence on the development of western art . [SEP]
[CLS] considered by many the greatest artist of his lifetime , and by some the greatest artist of all time , his artistic versa ##tility was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the arch ##ety ##pal renaissance man , along with his rival , the fellow fl ##ore ##ntine and client of the medici , leonardo da vinci . [SEP]
[CLS] the city of florence was at that time italy ' s greatest centre of the arts and learning . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 15th century , the architect filippo br ##une ##lles ##chi , having studied the remains of classical buildings in rome , had created two churches , san lorenzo ' s and santo spirit ##o , which embodied the classical pre ##ce ##pts . [SEP]
[CLS] the exterior niche ##s of the church of or ##san ##mic ##hel ##e contained a gallery of works by the most acclaimed sculptors of florence : donate ##llo , g ##hi ##bert ##i , andrea del ve ##rro ##cchi ##o , and nan ##ni di banco . [SEP]
[CLS] the interiors of the older churches were covered with fresco ##s ( mostly in late medieval , but also in the early renaissance style ) , begun by gi ##otto and continued by mas ##ac ##cio in the bran ##ca ##cci chapel , both of whose works michelangelo studied and copied in drawings . [SEP]
[CLS] during michelangelo ' s childhood , a team of painters had been called from florence to the vatican to decorate the walls of the sis ##tine chapel . [SEP]
[CLS] the next year , his father persuaded g ##hir ##landa ##io to pay michelangelo as an artist , which was rare for someone of fourteen . [SEP]
[CLS] when in 148 ##9 , lorenzo de ' medici , de facto ruler of florence , asked g ##hir ##landa ##io for his two best pupils , g ##hir ##landa ##io sent michelangelo and francesco gran ##ac ##ci . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo worked for a time with the sculptor bert ##old ##o di giovanni . [SEP]
[CLS] when he was seventeen , another pupil , pietro tor ##ri ##gia ##no , struck him on the nose , causing the di ##sf ##ig ##ure ##ment that is conspicuous in the portraits of michelangelo . [SEP]
[CLS] between 149 ##3 and 149 ##4 he bought a block of marble , and carved a larger - than - life statue of hercules , which was sent to france and subsequently disappeared sometime in the 18th century . [SEP]
[CLS] on 20 january 149 ##4 , after heavy snowfall ##s , lorenzo ' s heir , pier ##o de medici , commissioned a snow statue , and michelangelo again entered the court of the medici . [SEP]
[CLS] in bologna , he was commissioned to car ##ve several of the last small figures for the completion of the shrine of st . dominic , in the church dedicated to that saint . [SEP]
[CLS] at this time michelangelo studied the robust reliefs carved by ja ##co ##po della que ##rc ##ia around main portal of the basilica of st pet ##ron ##ius , including the panel of " the creation of eve " the composition of which was to re ##app ##ear on the sis ##tine chapel ceiling . [SEP]
[CLS] the city , previously under threat from the french , was no longer in danger as charles viii had suffered defeats . [SEP]
[CLS] during the half year he spent in florence , he worked on two small statues , a child " st . john the baptist " and a sleeping " cup ##id " . [SEP]
[CLS] according to con ##di ##vi , lorenzo di pier ##fra ##nce ##sco de ' medici , for whom michelangelo had sculpted " st . john the baptist " , asked that michelangelo " fix it so that it looked as if it had been buried " so he could " send it to rome . . . pass it off as an ancient work and . . . sell it much better . " [SEP]
[CLS] both lorenzo and michelangelo were un ##wi ##tting ##ly cheated out of the real value of the piece by a middle ##man . [SEP]
[CLS] this apparent success in selling his sculpture abroad as well as the conservative fl ##ore ##ntine situation may have encouraged michelangelo to accept the prelate ' s invitation . [SEP]
[CLS] on 4 july of the same year , he began work on a commission for cardinal raf ##fa ##ele ri ##ario , an over - life - size statue of the roman wine god " ba ##cc ##hus " . [SEP]
[CLS] upon completion , the work was rejected by the cardinal , and subsequently entered the collection of the banker ja ##co ##po gall ##i , for his garden . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 149 ##7 , the french ambassador to the holy see , cardinal jean de bi ##l ##her ##es - la ##gra ##ula ##s , commissioned him to car ##ve a " pie ##ta " , a sculpture showing the virgin mary gr ##ieving over the body of jesus . [SEP]
[CLS] the subject , which is not part of the biblical narrative of the cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion , was common in religious sculpture of medieval northern europe and would have been very familiar to the cardinal . [SEP]
[CLS] it was soon to be regarded as one of the world ' s great masterpiece ##s of sculpture , " a revelation of all the potential ##ities and force of the art of sculpture " . [SEP]
[CLS] contemporary opinion was sum ##mar ##ised by va ##sari : " it is certainly a miracle that a form ##less block of stone could ever have been reduced to a perfection that nature is scarcely able to create in the flesh . " [SEP]
[CLS] the republic was changing after the fall of its leader , anti - renaissance priest giro ##lam ##o sa ##von ##aro ##la , who was executed in 149 ##8 , and the rise of the " go ##n ##fa ##lon ##iere " pier ##o so ##der ##ini . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo was asked by the consul ##s of the guild of wool to complete an unfinished project begun 40 years earlier by ago ##sti ##no di duc ##cio : a colossal statue of carr ##ara marble portraying david as a symbol of fl ##ore ##ntine freedom to be placed on the gable of florence cathedral . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo responded by completing his most famous work , the statue of david , in 150 ##4 . [SEP]
[CLS] the master ##work definitive ##ly established his prominence as a sculptor of extraordinary technical skill and strength of symbolic imagination . [SEP]
[CLS] in early 150 ##4 leonardo da vinci had been commissioned to paint " the battle of ang ##hia ##ra " in the council chamber of the palazzo ve ##cchi ##o , depicting the battle between florence and milan in 144 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] the two paintings are very different : leonardo depicts soldiers fighting on horseback , while michelangelo has soldiers being ambushed as they bath ##e in the river . [SEP]
[CLS] both works were much admired , and copies remain of them , leonardo ' s work having been copied by ruben ##s and michelangelo ' s by bas ##tian ##o da sang ##all ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] in 150 ##5 michelangelo was invited back to rome by the newly elected pope julius ii and commissioned to build the pope ' s tomb , which was to include forty statues and be finished in five years . [SEP]
[CLS] under the patronage of the pope , michelangelo experienced constant interruption ##s to his work on the tomb in order to accomplish numerous other tasks . [SEP]
[CLS] although michelangelo worked on the tomb for 40 years , it was never finished to his satisfaction . [SEP]
[CLS] according to con ##di ##vi ' s account , bram ##ante , who was working on the building of st . peter ' s basilica , resented michelangelo ' s commission for the pope ' s tomb and convinced the pope to commission him in a medium with which he was unfamiliar , in order that he might fail at the task . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo was originally commissioned to paint the twelve apostles on the triangular pen ##dent ##ives that supported the ceiling , and to cover the central part of the ceiling with or ##name ##nt . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo persuaded pope julius to give him a free hand and proposed a different and more complex scheme , representing the creation , the fall of man , the promise of salvation through the prophets , and the genealogy of christ . [SEP]
[CLS] at its centre are nine episodes from the book of genesis , divided into three groups : god ' s creation of the earth ; god ' s creation of human ##kind and their fall from god ' s grace ; and lastly , the state of humanity as represented by noah and his family . [SEP]
[CLS] on the pen ##dent ##ives supporting the ceiling are painted twelve men and women who prop ##hes ##ied the coming of jesus , seven prophets of israel , and five si ##by ##ls , prophet ##ic women of the classical world . [SEP]
[CLS] among the most famous paintings on the ceiling are the creation of adam , adam and eve in the garden of eden , the del ##uge , the prophet jeremiah , and the cum ##aea ##n si ##by ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] pope leo commissioned michelangelo to rec ##ons ##truct the facade of the basilica of san lorenzo in florence and to ad ##orn it with sculptures . [SEP]
[CLS] he agreed reluctantly and spent three years creating drawings and models for the facade , as well as attempting to open a new marble quarry at pie ##tra ##sant ##a specifically for the project . [SEP]
[CLS] in 152 ##0 the medici came back to michelangelo with another grand proposal , this time for a family fun ##era ##ry chapel in the basilica of san lorenzo . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo used his own discretion to create the composition of the medici chapel , which houses the large tombs of two of the younger members of the medici family , gi ##ulia ##no , duke of ne ##mour ##s , and lorenzo , his nephew . [SEP]
[CLS] the tombs display statues of the two medici and all ##egorical figures representing night and day , and dusk and dawn . [SEP]
[CLS] he designed both the interior of the library itself and its vest ##ib ##ule , a building ut ##ilis ##ing architectural forms with such dynamic effect that it is seen as the forerunner of baroque architecture . [SEP]
[CLS] in 152 ##7 , fl ##ore ##ntine citizens , encouraged by the sack of rome , threw out the medici and restored the republic . [SEP]
[CLS] a siege of the city ensued , and michelangelo went to the aid of his beloved florence by working on the city ' s fortifications from 152 ##8 to 152 ##9 . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo fell out of favour with the young alessandro medici , who had been installed as the first duke of florence . [SEP]
[CLS] fearing for his life , he fled to rome , leaving assistants to complete the medici chapel and the laurent ##ian library . [SEP]
[CLS] despite michelangelo ' s support of the republic and resistance to the medici rule , he was welcomed by pope clement , who reinstated an allowance that he had previously granted the artist and made a new contract with him over the tomb of pope julius . [SEP]
[CLS] in rome , michelangelo lived near the church of santa maria di lore ##to . [SEP]
[CLS] it was at this time that he met the poet vi ##tto ##ria colon ##na , march ##ion ##ess of pe ##sca ##ra , who was to become one of his closest friends until her death in 154 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] shortly before his death in 153 ##4 pope clement vii commissioned michelangelo to paint a fresco of " the last judgement " on the altar wall of the sis ##tine chapel . [SEP]
[CLS] his successor , paul iii , was instrumental in seeing that michelangelo began and completed the project , which he labour ##ed on from 153 ##4 to october 154 ##1 . [SEP]
[CLS] once completed , the depiction of christ and the virgin mary naked was considered sac ##ril ##eg ##ious , and cardinal cara ##fa and mons ##ign ##or ser ##nin ##i ( man ##tua ' s ambassador ) campaigned to have the fresco removed or ce ##nsor ##ed , but the pope resisted . [SEP]
[CLS] at the council of trent , shortly before michelangelo ' s death in 156 ##4 , it was decided to obscure the gen ##ital ##s and daniel ##e da vol ##ter ##ra , an apprentice of michelangelo , was commissioned to make the alterations . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo worked on a number of architectural projects at this time . [SEP]
[CLS] they included a design for the capitol ##ine hill with its trap ##ez ##oid piazza displaying the ancient bronze statue of marcus au ##rel ##ius . [SEP]
[CLS] he designed the upper floor of the palazzo far ##nese and the interior of the church of santa maria de ##gli angel ##i , in which he transformed the vaulted interior of an ancient roman bath ##house . [SEP]
[CLS] other architectural works include san giovanni dei fi ##ore ##nti ##ni , the sf ##or ##za chapel ( cape ##lla sf ##or ##za ) in the basilica di santa maria mag ##gio ##re and the port ##a pia . [SEP]
[CLS] like the " last judgement " , these two works are complex compositions containing a great number of figures . [SEP]
[CLS] he returned to the concepts of bram ##ante , and developed his ideas for a centrally planned church , strengthening the structure both physically and visually . [SEP]
[CLS] as construction was progressing on st peter ' s , there was concern that michelangelo would pass away before the dome was finished . [SEP]
[CLS] however , once building commenced on the lower part of the dome , the supporting ring , the completion of the design was inevitable . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo was abs ##tem ##ious in his personal life , and once told his apprentice , as ##can ##io con ##di ##vi : " however rich i may have been , i have always lived like a poor man . " [SEP]
[CLS] he may not have minded , since he was by nature a solitary and melancholy person , " bi ##zza ##rro e fantastic ##o , " a man who " withdrew himself from the company of men . " [SEP]
[CLS] it is impossible to know for certain whether michelangelo had physical relationships ( con ##di ##vi ascribed to him a " monk - like cha ##sti ##ty " ) , but the nature of his sexuality is made apparent in his poetry . [SEP]
[CLS] in 154 ##2 , michelangelo met ce ##cchi ##no dei bra ##cci who died only a year later , inspiring michelangelo to write forty - eight funeral ep ##ig ##ram ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the objects of michelangelo ' s affection ##s , and subjects of his poetry , took advantage of him : the model feb ##o di po ##ggio asked for money in response to a love - poem , and a second model , g ##her ##ardo per ##ini , stole from him shame ##lessly . [SEP]
[CLS] the openly homo ##ero ##tic nature of the poetry has been a source of discomfort to later generations . [SEP]
[CLS] late in life , michelangelo nur ##ture ##d a great plato ##nic love for the poet and noble widow vi ##tto ##ria colon ##na , whom he met in rome in 153 ##6 or 153 ##8 and who was in her late fort ##ies at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] they wrote son ##nets for each other and were in regular contact until she died . [SEP]
[CLS] it is carved in shallow relief , a technique often employed by the master - sculptor of the early 15th century , donate ##llo , and others such as des ##ider ##io da set ##ti ##gnan ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] while the madonna is in profile , the easiest aspect for a shallow relief , the child displays a twisting motion that was to become characteristic of michelangelo ' s work . [SEP]
[CLS] the " br ##uge ##s madonna " was , at the time of its creation , unlike other such statues depicting the virgin proudly presenting her son . [SEP]
[CLS] the " don ##i ton ##do " , depicting the holy family , has elements of all three previous works : the fr ##ie ##ze of figures in the background has the appearance of a low - relief , while the circular shape and dynamic forms echo the tad ##de ##o ton ##do . [SEP]
[CLS] the painting herald ##s the forms , movement and colour that michelangelo was to employ on the ceiling of the sis ##tine chapel . [SEP]
[CLS] the kneeling angel is an early work , one of several that michelangelo created as part of a large decorative scheme for the arc ##a di san domenico in the church dedicated to that saint in bologna . [SEP]
[CLS] although the two angels form a pair , there is a great contrast between the two works , the one depicting a delicate child with flowing hair clothed in gothic robes with deep folds , and michelangelo ' s depicting a robust and muscular youth with eagle ' s wings , clad in a garment of classical style . [SEP]
[CLS] the sculpture has all the traditional attributes , a vine wreath , a cup of wine and a fa ##wn , but michelangelo ing ##ested an air of reality into the subject , depicting him with b ##lea ##ry eyes , a swollen bladder and a stance that suggests he is un ##stead ##y on his feet . [SEP]
[CLS] while the work is plainly inspired by classical sculpture , it is innovative for its rotating movement and strongly three - dimensional quality , which encourages the viewer to look at it from every angle . [SEP]
[CLS] in the so - called " dying slave " , michelangelo has again ut ##ilised the figure with marked contra ##post ##o to suggest a particular human state , in this case waking from sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] the works give a unique insight into the sc ##ul ##pt ##ural methods that michelangelo employed and his way of revealing what he perceived within the rock . [SEP]
[CLS] the ceiling is a flattened barrel vault supported on twelve triangular pen ##dent ##ives that rise from between the windows of the chapel . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo , who was reluctant to take the job , persuaded the pope to give him a free hand in the composition . [SEP]
[CLS] the scheme is of nine panels illustrating episodes from the book of genesis , set in an architect ##onic frame . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo began painting with the later episodes in the narrative , the pictures including location ##al details and groups of figures , the " drunken ##ness of noah " being the first of this group . [SEP]
[CLS] in the later compositions , painted after the initial sc ##af ##folding had been removed , michelangelo made the figures larger . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the central images , " the creation of adam " is one of the best known and most reproduced works in the history of art . [SEP]
[CLS] as the model for the creator , michelangelo has depicted himself in the action of painting the ceiling . [SEP]
[CLS] as supporters to the smaller scenes , michelangelo painted twenty youths who have variously been interpreted as angels , as muse ##s , or simply as decoration . [SEP]
[CLS] in the process of painting the ceiling , michelangelo made studies for different figures , of which some , such as that for " the libyan si ##by ##l " have survived , demonstrating the care taken by michelangelo in details such as the hands and feet . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo ' s relief of the " battle of the cent ##aur ##s " , created while he was still a youth associated with the medici academy , is an unusually complex relief in that it shows a great number of figures involved in a vigorous struggle . [SEP]
[CLS] such a complex di ##sar ##ray of figures was rare in fl ##ore ##ntine art , where it would usually only be found in images showing either the massacre of the innocent ##s or the torment ##s of hell . [SEP]
[CLS] the relief treatment , in which some of the figures are bold ##ly projecting , may indicate michelangelo ' s familiarity with roman sar ##co ##pha ##gus reliefs from the collection of lorenzo medici , and similar marble panels created by nicola and giovanni pisa ##no , and with the figurative compositions on g ##hi ##bert ##i ' s baptist ##ry doors . [SEP]
[CLS] the composition of the " battle of cas ##cina " , is known in its entirety only from copies , as the original cartoon , according to va ##sari , was so admired that it deteriorated and was eventually in pieces . [SEP]
[CLS] it reflects the earlier relief in the energy and diversity of the figures , with many different posture ##s , and many being viewed from the back , as they turn towards the approaching enemy and prepare for battle . [SEP]
[CLS] mel ##oz ##zo ' s majestic figure of christ , with wind ##bl ##own cloak , demonstrates a degree of fore ##sho ##rte ##ning of the figure that had also been employed by andrea man ##te ##gna , but was not usual in the fresco ##s of fl ##ore ##ntine painters . [SEP]
[CLS] in " the last judgement " michelangelo had the opportunity to depict , on an unprecedented scale , figures in the action of either rising heaven ##ward or falling and being dragged down . [SEP]
[CLS] in the two fresco ##s of the pauline chapel , " the cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion of st . peter " and " the conversion of saul " , michelangelo has used the various groups of figures to convey a complex narrative . [SEP]
[CLS] in the " cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion of peter " soldiers busy themselves about their assigned duty of digging a post hole and raising the cross while various people look on and discuss the events . [SEP]
[CLS] a group of horrified women cluster in the fore ##ground , while another group of christians is led by a tall man to witness the events . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same church , gi ##ulio de ' medici ( later pope clement vii ) commissioned him to design the medici chapel and the tombs of gi ##ulia ##no and lorenzo medici . [SEP]
[CLS] pope clement also commissioned the laurent ##ian library , for which michelangelo also designed the extraordinary vest ##ib ##ule with columns recess ##ed into niche ##s , and a staircase that appears to spill out of the library like a flow of lava , according to nikola ##us pe ##vs ##ner , " . . . revealing manner ##ism in its most sublime architectural form . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 154 ##6 michelangelo produced the highly complex o ##vo ##id design for the pavement of the camp ##ido ##glio and began designing an upper storey for the far ##nese palace . [SEP]
[CLS] in 154 ##7 he took on the job of completing st peter ' s basilica , begun to a design by bram ##ante , and with several intermediate designs by several architects . [SEP]
[CLS] although the late 16th - century engraving depicts the dome as having a hem ##is ##pher ##ical profile , the dome of michelangelo ' s model is somewhat o ##vo ##id and the final product , as completed by giacomo della port ##a is more so . [SEP]
[CLS] in his old age , michelangelo created a number of " pie ##tas " in which he apparently reflects upon mortality . [SEP]
[CLS] in the " fl ##ore ##ntine pie ##ta " , michelangelo again depicts himself , this time as the aged nico ##de ##mus lowering the body of jesus from the cross into the arms of mary his mother and mary magdalene . [SEP]
[CLS] his pupil ti ##ber ##io cal ##ca ##gni repaired the arm and drilled a hole in which to fix a replacement leg which was not subsequently attached . [SEP]
[CLS] the last sculpture that michelangelo worked on ( six days before his death ) , the " ron ##dan ##ini pie ##ta " could never be completed because michelangelo carved it away until there was insufficient stone . [SEP]
[CLS] his body was taken from rome for inter ##ment at the basilica of santa cr ##oc ##e , fulfilling the maestro ' s last request to be buried in his beloved florence . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo , with leonardo da vinci and raphael , is one of the three giants of the fl ##ore ##ntine high renaissance . [SEP]
[CLS] although their names are often cited together , michelangelo was younger than leonardo by 23 years , and older than raphael by eight . [SEP]
[CLS] he employed francesco gran ##ac ##ci , who was his fellow pupil at the medici academy , and became one of several assistants on the sis ##tine chapel ceiling . [SEP]
[CLS] despite this , his works were to have a great influence on painters , sculptors and architects for many generations to come . [SEP]
[CLS] while michelangelo ' s " david " is the most famous male nude of all time and destined to be reproduced in order to grace cities around the world , some of his other works have had perhaps even greater impact on the course of art . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo ' s foyer of the laurent ##ian library was one of the earliest buildings to ut ##ilis ##e classical forms in a plastic and expressive manner . [SEP]
[CLS] the dome of st peter ' s was to influence the building of churches for many centuries , including sant ' andrea della valle in rome and st paul ' s cathedral , london , as well as the civic domes of many public buildings and the state capitals across america . [SEP]
[CLS] artists who were directly influenced by michelangelo include raphael , whose monumental treatment of the figure in the " school of athens " and " the expulsion of he ##lio ##dor ##us from the temple " owes much to michelangelo , and whose fresco of " isaiah " in sant ' ago ##sti ##no closely im ##itate ##s the older master ' s prophets . [SEP]
[CLS] other artists , such as pont ##or ##mo , drew on the writhing forms of the " last judgement " and the frescoes of the cape ##lla pa ##olin ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] the sis ##tine chapel ceiling was a work of unprecedented grande ##ur , both for its architect ##onic forms , to be im ##itated by many baroque ceiling painters , and also for the wealth of its in ##vent ##ive ##ness in the study of figures . [SEP]
