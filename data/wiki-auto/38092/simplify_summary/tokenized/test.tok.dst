[CLS] don giovanni ( ] ; k . 52 ##7 ; complete title : , literally " the rake punished , namely don giovanni " or " the li ##bert ##ine punished " ) is an opera in two acts with music by wolfgang amadeus mozart and italian libretto by lorenzo da pont ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] it is based on the legends of don juan , a fictional li ##bert ##ine and seduce ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] it was premiered by the prague italian opera at the national theater ( of bohemia ) , now called the estates theatre , on 29 october 1787 . [SEP]
[CLS] da pont ##e ' s libretto was billed as a " dr ##am ##ma gi ##oco ##so " , a common designation of its time that denotes a mixing of serious and comic action . [SEP]
[CLS] mozart entered the work into his catalogue as an " opera buff ##a " . [SEP]
[CLS] although sometimes classified as comic , it blend ##s comedy , mel ##od ##rama and supernatural elements . [SEP]
[CLS] a staple of the standard operatic repertoire , " don giovanni " for the five seasons 2011 / 12 through 2015 / 16 was ninth on the opera ##base list of the most - performed operas worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] it has also proved a fruit ##ful subject for writers and philosophers . [SEP]
[CLS] the opera was commissioned as a result of the overwhelming success of mozart ' s trip to prague in january and february 1787 . [SEP]
[CLS] the subject matter may have been chosen in consideration of the long history of don juan operas in prague ; the genre of eighteenth - century don juan opera originated in prague . [SEP]
[CLS] the libretto of lorenzo da pont ##e was based closely on a libretto by giovanni bert ##ati for the opera " don giovanni tenor ##io " , first performed in venice early in 1787 , although he was lo ##ath to admit this in memoirs written decades later . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the most important elements that he copied were the idea of opening the drama with the murder of the com ##men ##da ##tore ( in earlier dramas , this incident always appeared somewhere in the middle ) and the lack of a specification of seville as the setting , which had been customary in the tradition of don juan dramas since the appearance of the prototype don juan drama " el bu ##rl ##ador de sevilla " by ti ##rso de molina , written in the early 17th century . [SEP]
[CLS] for bert ##ati , the setting was ville ##na , spain , whereas da pont ##e ' s libretto only specifies a " city in spain " . [SEP]
[CLS] according to some sources , giacomo casa ##nova assisted in the writing . [SEP]
[CLS] " don giovanni " was originally to have been performed on 14 october 1787 for a visit to prague of the arch ##du ##ches ##s maria theresa of austria , niece of the emperor joseph ii , and her new husband , prince anthony of saxony ; however , the production could not be prepared in time and " le no ##zz ##e di fig ##aro " was substituted instead on the order of the emperor himself . [SEP]
[CLS] the score was completed on 28 or 29 october 1787 after da pont ##e was recalled to vienna to work on another opera . [SEP]
[CLS] reports about the last - minute completion of the overture conflict ; some say it was completed the day before the premiere , some on the very day . [SEP]
[CLS] more likely it was completed the day before , in light of the fact that mozart recorded the completion of the opera on 28 october . [SEP]
[CLS] the score calls for double wood ##wind ##s , two horns , two trumpets , three trombone ##s ( alto , tenor , bass ) , tim ##pani , bass ##o con ##tin ##uo for the rec ##itative ##s , and the usual string section . [SEP]
[CLS] the composer also specified occasional special musical effects . [SEP]
[CLS] for the ballroom scene at the end of the first act , mozart calls for two onstage ensembles to play separate dance music in sync ##hr ##oni ##zation with the pit orchestra , each of the three groups playing in its own metre ( a 3 / 4 min ##uet , a 2 / 4 contra ##dan ##se and a fast 3 / 8 peasant dance ) , accompanying the dancing of the principal characters . [SEP]
[CLS] in act 2 , giovanni is seen to play the mandolin , accompanied by pi ##zzi ##cat ##o strings . [SEP]
[CLS] in the same act , two of the com ##men ##da ##tore ' s interventions ( " " and " " ) are accompanied by a wind chorale of oboe ##s , clarinet ##s , bass ##oons , and trombone ##s ( with cello ##s and bass ##es playing from the string section ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the opera was first performed on 29 october 1787 in prague under its full title of " il di ##sso ##lu ##to pun ##ito os ##sia il don giovanni " – dr ##am ##ma gi ##oco ##so in due at ##ti ( " the rake punished , or don giovanni " , a dr ##am ##ma gi ##oco ##so in two acts ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the work was rap ##tur ##ously received , as was often true of mozart ' s work in prague . [SEP]
[CLS] the " pr ##ager obe ##rp ##osta ##mt ##ze ##itung " reported , " con ##no ##isse ##urs and musicians say that prague has never heard the like , " and " the opera . . . is extremely difficult to perform . " [SEP]
[CLS] the " provincial ##nac ##hri ##cht ##en " of vienna reported , " herr mozart conducted in person and was welcomed joy ##ously and ju ##bil ##antly by the numerous gathering . " [SEP]
[CLS] mozart also supervised the vienna premiere of the work , which took place on 7 may 1788 . [SEP]
[CLS] for this production , he wrote two new arias with corresponding rec ##itative ##s – don ot ##ta ##vio ' s aria " " ( k . 540 ##a , composed on 24 april for the tenor francesco more ##lla ) , el ##vira ' s aria " " ( k . 540 ##c , composed on 30 april for the soprano cater ##ina cavalier ##i ) – and the duet between le ##pore ##llo and ze ##rlin ##a " " ( k . 540 ##b , composed on 28 april ) . [SEP]
[CLS] he also made some cuts in the finale in order to make it shorter and more inc ##isi ##ve , the most important of which is the section where anna and ot ##ta ##vio , el ##vira , ze ##rlin ##a and mas ##etto , le ##pore ##llo reveal their plans for the future ( " " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to connect " " ( " it must have been the ghost she met " ) directly to the moral of the story " " ( " this is the end which be ##falls to evil ##do ##ers " ) , mozart composed a different version of " " ( " so the wr ##et ##ch can stay down there with prose ##rp ##ina and pluto ! " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these cuts are very seldom performed in theatres or recordings . [SEP]
[CLS] the opera ' s final ensemble was generally omitted until the early 20th century , a tradition that apparently began very early on . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the 19th - century bohemian memoir ##ist wilhelm ku ##he , the final ensemble was only presented at the very first performance in prague , then never heard again during the original run . [SEP]
[CLS] it does not appear in the vie ##nne ##se libretto of 1788 ; thus the ending of the first performance in vienna without the ensemble as depicted in the film " amadeus " must be an accurate portrayal . [SEP]
[CLS] undoubtedly , this practice was sanctioned by mozart himself . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , the final ensemble is almost invariably performed in full today . [SEP]
[CLS] modern productions sometimes include both the original aria for don ot ##ta ##vio , " " , and its replacement from the first production in vienna that was crafted to suit the capabilities of the tenor francesco more ##lla , " " . [SEP]

[CLS] the duet " " and the whole accompanying scene involving ze ##rlin ##a and le ##pore ##llo from the vie ##nne ##se version is almost never included . [SEP]
[CLS] in modern - day productions , mas ##etto and the com ##men ##da ##tore are typically played by different singers ( unless limited by such things as finance or rehearsal time and space ) , although the same singer played both roles in both the prague and vienna premiere ##s , and the final scene ' s chorus of demons after the com ##men ##da ##tore ' s exit gives the singer time for a costume change before entering as mas ##etto for the sex ##tet .
