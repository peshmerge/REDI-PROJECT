Don Giovanni (] ; K. 527; complete title: , literally "The Rake Punished, namely Don Giovanni" or "The Libertine Punished") is an opera in two acts with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Italian libretto by Lorenzo Da Ponte.
It is based on the legends of Don Juan, a fictional libertine and seducer.
It was premiered by the Prague Italian opera at the National Theater (of Bohemia), now called the Estates Theatre, on 29 October 1787.
Mozart entered the work into his catalogue as an "opera buffa".
The subject matter may have been chosen in consideration of the long history of Don Juan operas in Prague; the genre of eighteenth-century Don Juan opera originated in Prague.
The libretto of Lorenzo Da Ponte was based closely on a libretto by Giovanni Bertati for the opera "Don Giovanni Tenorio", first performed in Venice early in 1787, although he was loath to admit this in memoirs written decades later.
Some of the most important elements that he copied were the idea of opening the drama with the murder of the Commendatore (in earlier dramas, this incident always appeared somewhere in the middle) and the lack of a specification of Seville as the setting, which had been customary in the tradition of Don Juan dramas since the appearance of the prototype Don Juan drama "El burlador de Sevilla" by Tirso de Molina, written in the early 17th century.
For Bertati, the setting was Villena, Spain, whereas Da Ponte's libretto only specifies a "city in Spain".
"Don Giovanni" was originally to have been performed on 14 October 1787 for a visit to Prague of the Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, niece of the Emperor Joseph II, and her new husband, Prince Anthony of Saxony; however, the production could not be prepared in time and "Le nozze di Figaro" was substituted instead on the order of the emperor himself.
The score was completed on 28 or 29 October 1787 after Da Ponte was recalled to Vienna to work on another opera.
The score calls for double woodwinds, two horns, two trumpets, three trombones (alto, tenor, bass), timpani, basso continuo for the recitatives, and the usual string section.
For the ballroom scene at the end of the first act, Mozart calls for two onstage ensembles to play separate dance music in synchronization with the pit orchestra, each of the three groups playing in its own metre (a 3/4 minuet, a 2/4 contradanse and a fast 3/8 peasant dance), accompanying the dancing of the principal characters.
In the same act, two of the Commendatore's interventions (" " and " ") are accompanied by a wind chorale of oboes, clarinets, bassoons, and trombones (with cellos and basses playing from the string section).
The opera was first performed on 29 October 1787 in Prague under its full title of "Il dissoluto punito ossia il Don Giovanni" – Dramma giocoso in due atti ("The Rake punished, or Don Giovanni", a dramma giocoso in two acts).
The "Provincialnachrichten" of Vienna reported, "Herr Mozart conducted in person and was welcomed joyously and jubilantly by the numerous gathering."
For this production, he wrote two new arias with corresponding recitatives – Don Ottavio's aria " " (K. 540a, composed on 24 April for the tenor Francesco Morella), Elvira's aria " " (K. 540c, composed on 30 April for the soprano Caterina Cavalieri) – and the duet between Leporello and Zerlina " " (K. 540b, composed on 28 April).
He also made some cuts in the Finale in order to make it shorter and more incisive, the most important of which is the section where Anna and Ottavio, Elvira, Zerlina and Masetto, Leporello reveal their plans for the future (" ").
In order to connect " " ("It must have been the ghost she met") directly to the moral of the story " " ("This is the end which befalls to evildoers"), Mozart composed a different version of " " ("So the wretch can stay down there with Proserpina and Pluto!").
The opera's final ensemble was generally omitted until the early 20th century, a tradition that apparently began very early on.
According to the 19th-century Bohemian memoirist Wilhelm Kuhe, the final ensemble was only presented at the very first performance in Prague, then never heard again during the original run.
It does not appear in the Viennese libretto of 1788; thus the ending of the first performance in Vienna without the ensemble as depicted in the film "Amadeus" must be an accurate portrayal.
Modern productions sometimes include both the original aria for Don Ottavio, " ", and its replacement from the first production in Vienna that was crafted to suit the capabilities of the tenor Francesco Morella, " ".
The duet " " and the whole accompanying scene involving Zerlina and Leporello from the Viennese version is almost never included.
In modern-day productions, Masetto and the Commendatore are typically played by different singers (unless limited by such things as finance or rehearsal time and space), although the same singer played both roles in both the Prague and Vienna premieres, and the final scene's chorus of demons after the Commendatore's exit gives the singer time for a costume change before entering as Masetto for the sextet.
The overture begins with a thundering D minor cadence, followed by a short sequence which leads into a light-hearted D major allegro.
Scene 1 – "The garden of the Commendatore"
Leporello, Don Giovanni's servant, grumbles about his demanding master and daydreams about being free of him (" " – "Night and day I slave away").
He is keeping watch while Don Giovanni is in the Commendatore's house attempting to seduce or rape the Commendatore's daughter, Donna Anna.
The Commendatore blocks Don Giovanni's path and forces him to fight a duel.
Donna Anna, returning with her fiancé, Don Ottavio, is horrified to see her father lying dead in a pool of his own blood.
They hear a woman (Donna Elvira) singing of having been abandoned by her lover, on whom she is seeking revenge (" " – "Ah, who could ever tell me").
Don Giovanni starts to flirt with her, but it turns out he is the former lover she is seeking.
Don Giovanni is immediately attracted to Zerlina, and he attempts to remove the jealous Masetto by offering to host a wedding celebration at his castle.
Don Giovanni and Zerlina are soon alone and he immediately begins his seductive arts (Duet: "Là ci darem la mano" – "There we will entwine our hands").
Donna Anna, unaware that she is speaking to her attacker, pleads for Don Giovanni's help.
Don Giovanni, relieved that he is unrecognised, readily promises it, and asks who has disturbed her peace.
Before she can answer, Donna Elvira returns and tells Donna Anna and Don Ottavio that Don Giovanni is a false-hearted seducer.
As Don Giovanni leaves, Donna Anna suddenly recognizes him as her father's murderer and tells Don Ottavio the story of his intrusion, claiming that she was deceived at first because she was expecting a night visit from Don Ottavio himself, but managed to fight Don Giovanni off after discovering the imposture (long recitative exchange between Donna Anna and Don Ottavio).
She repeats her demand that he avenge her and points out that he will be avenging himself as well (aria: "Or sai chi l'onore Rapire a me volse" – "Now you know who wanted to rob me of my honour").
Leporello informs Don Giovanni that all the guests of the peasant wedding are in Don Giovanni's house and that he distracted Masetto from his jealousy, but that Zerlina, returning with Donna Elvira, made a scene and spoiled everything.
However, Don Giovanni remains cheerful and tells Leporello to organize a party and invite every girl he can find.
Scene 4 – "A garden outside Don Giovanni's palace" Zerlina follows the jealous Masetto and tries to pacify him (" " – "Beat, O beat me, handsome Masetto"), but just as she manages to persuade him of her innocence, Don Giovanni's voice from offstage startles and frightens her.
Masetto hides, resolving to see for himself what Zerlina will do when Don Giovanni arrives.
Zerlina tries to hide from Don Giovanni, but he finds her and attempts to continue the seduction, until he stumbles upon Masetto's hiding place.
Confused but quickly recovering, Don Giovanni reproaches Masetto for leaving Zerlina alone, and returns her temporarily to him.
Alone, Don Ottavio and Donna Anna pray for protection, Donna Elvira for vengeance (Trio: " " – "May the just heavens protect us").
Scene 5 – "Don Giovanni's ballroom"
As the merriment, featuring three separate chamber orchestras on stage, proceeds, Leporello distracts Masetto by dancing with him, while Don Giovanni leads Zerlina offstage to a private room and tries to assault her.
When Zerlina screams for help, Don Giovanni drags Leporello onstage from the room, accuses Leporello of assaulting Zerlina himself, and threatens to kill him.
Don Ottavio produces a pistol and points it at Don Giovanni, and the three guests unmask and declare that they know all.
But despite being denounced and menaced from all sides, Don Giovanni remains calm and escapes – for the moment.
Scene 1 – "Outside Donna Elvira's house" Leporello threatens to leave Don Giovanni, but his master calms him with a peace offering of money (Duet: "Eh via buffone" – "Go on, fool").
Wanting to seduce Donna Elvira's maid, and believing that she will trust him better if he appears in lower-class clothes, Don Giovanni orders Leporello to exchange cloak and hat with him.
From his hiding place Don Giovanni sings a promise of repentance, expressing a desire to return to her and threatening to kill himself if she does not take him back, while Leporello poses as Don Giovanni and tries to keep from laughing.
Leporello, continuing to pose as Don Giovanni, leads her away to keep her occupied while Don Giovanni serenades her maid with his mandolin.
Before Don Giovanni can complete his seduction of the maid, Masetto and his friends arrive, looking for Don Giovanni in order to kill him.
Don Giovanni poses as Leporello (whose clothes he is still wearing) and joins the posse, pretending that he also hates Don Giovanni.
Donna Elvira tries to protect the man who she thinks is Don Giovanni, claiming that he is her husband and begging the others to spare him.
He begs for mercy and, seeing an opportunity, runs off (Leporello aria: "Ah pietà signori miei" – "Ah, have mercy, my lords").
He swears vengeance ("Il mio tesoro" – "My treasure" – though in the Vienna version this was cut).
Also in the Vienna production, Donna Elvira is still furious at Don Giovanni for betraying her, but she also feels sorry for him.
Leporello tells Don Giovanni of his brush with danger, and Don Giovanni laughingly taunts him, saying that he took advantage of his disguise as Leporello by trying to seduce one of Leporello's girlfriends.
The voice of the statue interrupts and warns Don Giovanni that his laughter will not last beyond sunrise.
At the command of his master, Leporello reads the inscription upon the statue's base: "Here am I waiting for revenge against the scoundrel who killed me" ("Dell'empio che mi trasse al passo estremo qui attendo la vendetta").
The servant trembles, but Don Giovanni scornfully orders him to invite the statue to dinner, and threatens to kill him if he does not.
Leporello makes several attempts to invite the statue to dinner but is too frightened to complete the invitation (Duet: "O, statua gentilissima" – "Oh most noble statue").
Much to his surprise, the statue nods its head and responds affirmatively.
He accuses her of being cruel, and she assures him that she loves him, and is faithful ("Non mi dir" – "Tell me not").
Scene 5 – "Don Giovanni's chambers" Don Giovanni revels in the luxury of a great meal, served by Leporello, and musical entertainment during which the orchestra plays music from popular (at the time) late-18th-century operas: "O quanto un sì bel giubilo" from Vicente Martín y Soler's "Una cosa rara" (1786), "Come un agnello" from Giuseppe Sarti's "Fra i due litiganti il terzo gode" (1782) and finally, "Non più andrai" from Mozart's own "The Marriage of Figaro" (1786).
Don Giovanni orders Leporello to see what has upset her; when he does, he also cries out, and runs back into the room, stammering that the statue has appeared as promised.
Leporello, paralyzed by fear, cannot answer it, so Don Giovanni opens it himself, revealing the statue of the Commendatore.
You invited me to dine with you"), the statue offers a last chance to repent, but Don Giovanni adamantly refuses.
The statue disappears and Don Giovanni cries out in pain and terror as he is surrounded by a chorus of demons, who carry him down to Hell.
He assures them that no one will ever see Don Giovanni again.
The remaining characters announce their plans for the future: Donna Anna and Don Ottavio will marry when Donna Anna's year of mourning is over; Donna Elvira will withdraw from society for the rest of her life; Zerlina and Masetto will finally go home for dinner; and Leporello will go to the tavern to find a better master.
The concluding ensemble delivers the moral of the opera – "Such is the end of the evildoer: the death of a sinner always reflects his life" ("Questo è il fin di chi fa mal, e de' perfidi la morte alla vita è sempre ugual").
As mentioned above, the final ensemble was customarily omitted from productions for over a century beginning with the original run in Prague, but it started to be performed again frequently in the 20th century and is now is usually included in productions of the opera.
The return to D major and the innocent simplicity of the last few bars conclude the opera.
A screen adaptation of the opera was made under the title "Don Giovanni" in 1979 directed by Joseph Losey.
The Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard wrote a long essay in his book "Enten – Eller" in which he argues, writing under the pseudonym of his character "A", that "among all classic works "Don Giovanni" stands highest."
Charles Gounod wrote that Mozart's "Don Giovanni" is "a work without blemish, of uninterrupted perfection."
The finale, in which Don Giovanni refuses to repent, has been a captivating philosophical and artistic topic for many writers including George Bernard Shaw, who in "Man and Superman" parodied the opera (with explicit mention of the Mozart score for the finale scene between the Commendatore and Don Giovanni).
E. T. A. Hoffmann also wrote a short story derived from the opera, "Don Juan," in which the narrator meets Donna Anna and describes Don Juan as an aesthetic hero rebelling against God and society.
In some Germanic and other languages, Leporello's "Catalogue Aria" provided the name " list" for concertina-folded printed matter, as used for brochures, photo albums, computer printouts and other continuous stationery.
In it, Antonio Salieri notices how Mozart composed the opera while tortured after the death of his imposing father Leopold, and uses the information to psychologically torture Mozart even further.
The sustained popularity of "Don Giovanni" has resulted in extensive borrowings and arrangements of the original.
The most famous and probably the most musically substantial is the operatic fantasy, "Réminiscences de Don Juan" by Franz Liszt.
The minuet from the finale of act 1, transcribed by Moritz Moszkowski, also makes an incongruous appearance in the manuscript of Liszt's Fantasy on Themes from Mozart's "Figaro" and "Don Giovanni", and Sigismond Thalberg uses the same minuet, along with " ", in his , Op.
"
also makes an appearance in the Klavierübung of Ferruccio Busoni, under the title (Variation study after Mozart).
Chopin wrote Variations on "Là ci darem la mano" (the duet between Don Giovanni and Zerlina) for piano and orchestra.
The turkeys in Chabrier's "Ballade des gros dindons" (1889) finish each verse imitating the mandolin accompaniment of the Serenade.
In 1855, Mozart's original manuscript had been purchased in London by the mezzo-soprano Pauline Viardot, who was the teacher of Tchaikovsky's one-time unofficial fiancée Désirée Artôt (whom Viardot may have persuaded not to go through with her plan to marry the composer).
Viardot kept the manuscript in a shrine in her Paris home, where it was visited by many people.
Tchaikovsky visited her when he was in Paris in June 1886, and said that when looking at the manuscript, he was "in the presence of divinity".
So it is not surprising that the centenary of the opera in 1887 would inspire him to write something honouring Mozart.
Instead of taking any themes from "Don Giovanni", however, he took four lesser known works by Mozart and arranged them into his fourth orchestral suite, which he called "Mozartiana".
The baritone who sang the title role in the centenary performance of "Don Giovanni" in Prague that year was Mariano Padilla y Ramos, the man Désirée Artôt married instead of Tchaikovsky.
In addition to instrumental works, allusions to "Don Giovanni" also appear in a number of operas: Nicklausse of Offenbach's "The Tales of Hoffmann" sings a snatch of Leporello's " ", and Rossini alludes to the Commendatore's music for Selim's entrance in "Il turco in Italia".
