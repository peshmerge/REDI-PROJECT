mozart 's " don giovanni " is " a work without blemish , of uninterrupted perfection " .
don giovanni refuses to repent , and has been a captivating philosophical and artistic topic for many writers including george bernard shaw , who in " man and superman " parodied the opera with explicit mention of the mozart score for the finale scene between the commendatore and don giovanni domenico .
e . t . a . hoffmann also wrote a short story based on the opera " don juan " .

the most famous is the opera " reminiscences de don juan " by franz liszt .
the minuet from the finale of act 1 , transcribed by moritz moszkowski , also makes an incongruous appearance in the manuscript of liszt 's fantasy on themes from mozart 's " figaro " and " don giovanni " , and sigismond thalberg uses the same minuet , with " " , in his , op .

viardot kept the manuscript in a shrine in her paris home .
tchaikovsky visited her when he was in paris in june 1886 .
so it is surprising that the centenary of the opera in 1887 would inspire him to write something honouring mozart .
instead of taking any themes from " don giovanni " , however , he took four other works by mozart and arranged them into his fourth orchestral suite , which he called " mozartiana " .
the baritone who sang the title role in the centenary performance of " don giovanni " in prague that year was mariano padilla y ramos , the man desiree artot married instead of tchaikovsky .
in addition to some of the other works , he also appeared in a number of operas : nicklausse of offenbach 's " tales of hoffmann " sings a snatch of leporello 's " " , and rossini alludes to the commendatore 's music for selim in italia .
