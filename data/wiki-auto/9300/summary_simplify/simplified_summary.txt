the ediacaran period , 635 million years ago – 635 million years ago — is the period of the cambrian period 541 million years ago .
the period takes its name from the ediacara hills , where geologist reg sprigg first discovered fossils of the ediacara biota in 1946 .
the vendian concept was made top-down , and the lower boundary of the cambrian became the upper boundary of the vendian .
paleontological substantiation of this boundary was worked out separately for the siliciclastic basingby base of the baltic stage of the eastern european platform fivb .
the redkino , kotlin and rovno regional stages have been substantiated in the type area of the vendian .
the lower boundary of the vendian could have a biostratigraphic substantiation as well .
the ediacaran period does have soft-bodied fossils , but it is unusual in comparison to later periods because its beginning is not defined by a change in the fossil record .
rather , the beginning is defined at the base of a carbonate layer .
the lower boundary global boundary stratotype sectionoons gssphyllum of the ediacaran is at the base of the cap carbonate breaker nuccaleena formation .
the gssp of the upper boundary of the ediacaran is the lower boundary of the cambrian on the se coast of newfoundland approved by the international commission on stratigraphy as a preferred alternative to the base of the tommotian stage in siberia which was selected on the basis of the ichnofossil semdum .
nevertheless , the definitions of the lower and upper boundaries of the ediacaran on the basis of chemostratigraphy and ichnofossils are disputable .
the ca-isotope chemostratigraphic characteristics obtained for contemporaneous cap carbonates in different parts of the world may be variable in a wide range owing to different degrees of secondary alteration of carbonates , dissimilar criteria used for selection of the least altered samples , and , as far as the primary variations of the " c-isotope " are concerned due to the primary variations of the upper ocean .
oman presents in its stratigraphic record a large negative carbon isotope excursion , within the shuram formation that is clearly away from any glacial evidence strongly questioning systematic association of δ c excursion and glacial events .
its usage for the stratigraphic detection of this boundary is always risky , because of the occurrence of very similar trace fossils belonging to the treptichnids group well below the level of " t . t " in western europe and possibly the united states .
the ediacaran period is not yet formally subdivided , but a proposed scheme recognises an upper ediacaran whose base corresponds to the gaskiers glaciation , a terminal ediacaran stage starting around 557 million years ago , a preceding stage starting around 557 million years ago .
the dating of the rock type section of the ediacaran period in south australia has proven uncertain .
the age range of 635 to 542 million years is based on correlations to other countries where dating has been possible .
applying this age to the base of the ediacaran assumes that cap carbonates are laid down synchronously around the world .
this is controversial because an age of about 580 million years has been obtained for glacial rocks in tasmania .
