[CLS] the ed ##iac ##aran period , spans 94 million years from the end of the cry ##ogen ##ian period 63 ##5 million years ago ( my ##a ) , to the beginning of the cambrian period 54 ##1 my ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] it marks the end of the pro ##ter ##oz ##oic e ##on , and the beginning of the ph ##ane ##ro ##zo ##ic e ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] it is named after the ed ##iac ##ara hills of south australia . [SEP]
[CLS] the ed ##iac ##aran period ' s status as an official geological period was ratified in 2004 by the international union of geological sciences ( i ##ug ##s ) , making it the first new geological period declared in 120 years . [SEP]
[CLS] although the period takes its name from the ed ##iac ##ara hills where geologist reg sp ##ri ##gg first discovered fossils of the eponymous ed ##iac ##ara bio ##ta in 1946 , the type section is located in the bed of the en ##ora ##ma creek within bra ##chin ##a gorge in the flinders ranges of south australia , at . [SEP]
[CLS] the ed ##iac ##aran period overlap ##s , but is shorter than the ve ##ndi ##an period , a name that was earlier , in 1952 , proposed by russian geologist and pale ##ont ##ologist boris so ##ko ##lov . [SEP]
[CLS] the ve ##ndi ##an concept was formed st ##rat ##ig ##raphic ##ally top - down , and the lower boundary of the cambrian became the upper boundary of the ve ##ndi ##an . [SEP]
[CLS] pale ##ont ##ological sub ##stan ##tia ##tion of this boundary was worked out separately for the si ##lic ##ic ##lastic basin ( base of the baltic stage of the eastern european platform ) and for the carbonate basin ( base of the tom ##mot ##ian stage of the siberian platform ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the lower boundary of the ve ##ndi ##an was suggested to be defined at the base of the var ##anger ( lap ##land ##ian ) till ##ites . [SEP]
[CLS] the ve ##ndi ##an in its type area consists of large subdivisions such as lap ##land ##ian , red ##kin ##o , ko ##tl ##in and ro ##vn ##o regional stages with the globally trace ##able subdivisions and their boundaries , including its lower one . [SEP]
[CLS] the red ##kin ##o , ko ##tl ##in and ro ##vn ##o regional stages have been sub ##stan ##tia ##ted in the type area of the ve ##ndi ##an on the basis of the abundant organic - walled micro ##fo ##ssi ##ls , mega ##scopic algae , meta ##zo ##an body fossils and ich ##no ##fo ##ssi ##ls . [SEP]
[CLS] the lower boundary of the ve ##ndi ##an could have a bio ##stra ##ti ##graphic sub ##stan ##tia ##tion as well taking into consideration the worldwide occurrence of the per ##tat ##ata ##ka ass ##em ##bla ##ge of giant ac ##ant ##hom ##or ##ph ac ##rita ##rch ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the ed ##iac ##aran period ( c . 63 ##5 – 54 ##1 my ##a ) represents the time from the end of global marino ##an g ##la ##ciation to the first appearance worldwide of somewhat complicated trace fossils ( " tre ##ptic ##hn ##us pe ##du ##m " ( se ##ila ##cher , 1955 ) ) . [SEP]
[CLS] although the ed ##iac ##aran period does contain soft - bodied fossils , it is unusual in comparison to later periods because its beginning is not defined by a change in the fossil record . [SEP]
[CLS] rather , the beginning is defined at the base of a chemical ##ly distinctive carbonate layer that is referred to as a " cap carbonate , " because it caps glacial deposits . [SEP]
[CLS] this bed is characterized by an unusual de ##ple ##tion of c that indicates a sudden climatic change at the end of the marino ##an ice age . [SEP]
[CLS] the lower boundary global boundary st ##rat ##otype section ( gs ##sp ) of the ed ##iac ##aran is at the base of the cap carbonate ( nu ##cca ##leen ##a formation ) , immediately above the el ##atin ##a dia ##mic ##tite in the en ##ora ##ma creek section , bra ##chin ##a gorge , flinders ranges , south australia . [SEP]
[CLS] the gs ##sp of the upper boundary of the ed ##iac ##aran is the lower boundary of the cambrian on the se coast of newfoundland approved by the international commission on st ##rat ##igraphy as a preferred alternative to the base of the tom ##mot ##ian stage in siberia which was selected on the basis of the ich ##no ##fo ##ssi ##l " tre ##ptic ##hn ##us pe ##du ##m " ( se ##ila ##cher , 1955 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the history of st ##rat ##igraphy it was the first case of usage of bio ##tur ##bation ##s for the system boundary definition . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , the definitions of the lower and upper boundaries of the ed ##iac ##aran on the basis of che ##most ##rat ##igraphy and ich ##no ##fo ##ssi ##ls are di ##sp ##utable . [SEP]
[CLS] cap carbonate ##s generally have a restricted geographic distribution ( due to specific conditions of their precipitation ) and usually si ##lic ##ic ##lastic sediments lateral ##ly replace the cap carbonate ##s in a rather short distance but cap carbonate ##s do not occur above every till ##ite elsewhere in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] the c - isotope che ##most ##rat ##ig ##raphic characteristics obtained for con ##tem ##por ##aneous cap carbonate ##s in different parts of the world may be variable in a wide range owing to different degrees of secondary alteration of carbonate ##s , di ##ssi ##mi ##lar criteria used for selection of the least altered samples , and , as far as the c - isotope data are concerned , due to primary lateral variations of δ c in the upper layer of the ocean . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , oman presents in its st ##rat ##ig ##raphic record a large negative carbon isotope excursion , within the shu ##ram formation that is clearly away from any glacial evidence strongly questioning systematic association of negative δ c excursion and glacial events . [SEP]
[CLS] also , the shu ##ram excursion is prolonged and is estimated to last for ~ 9 . 0 my ##rs . [SEP]
[CLS] as to the " tre ##ptic ##hn ##us pe ##du ##m " , a reference ich ##no ##fo ##ssi ##l for the lower boundary of the cambrian , its usage for the st ##rat ##ig ##raphic detection of this boundary is always risky , because of the occurrence of very similar trace fossils belonging to the tre ##ptic ##hn ##ids group well below the level of " t . pe ##du ##m " in namibia , spain and newfoundland , and possibly , in the western united states . [SEP]
[CLS] the st ##rat ##ig ##raphic range of " t . pe ##du ##m " overlap ##s the range of the ed ##iac ##aran fossils in namibia , and probably in spain . [SEP]
[CLS] the ed ##iac ##aran period is not yet formally subdivided , but a proposed scheme recognise ##s an upper ed ##iac ##aran whose base corresponds with the gas ##kie ##rs g ##la ##ciation , a terminal ed ##iac ##aran stage starting around million years ago , a preceding stage beginning around 55 ##7 ma with the earliest widespread ed ##iac ##aran bio ##ta fossils ; two proposed schemes differ on whether the lower strata should be divided into an early and middle ed ##iac ##aran or not , because it ' s not clear whether the shu ##ram excursion ( which would divide the early and middle ) is a separate event from the gas ##kie ##rs , or whether the two events are correlated . [SEP]
[CLS] the dating of the rock type section of the ed ##iac ##aran period in south australia has proven uncertain . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , the age range of 63 ##5 to 54 ##2 million years is based on correlation ##s to other countries where dating has been possible . [SEP]
[CLS] the base age of approximately 63 ##5 million years is based on u – p ##b ( uranium – lead ) iso ##ch ##ron dating from namibia and china . [SEP]
[CLS] applying this age to the base of the ed ##iac ##aran assumes that cap carbonate ##s are laid down sync ##hr ##ono ##usly around the world and that the correct cap carbonate layers have been selected in such diverse local ##es as australian and namibia . [SEP]
[CLS] this is controversial because an age of about 580 million years has been obtained for glacial rocks in tasmania which some scientists tentatively assign to those just beneath the ed ##iac ##aran rocks of the flinders ranges . [SEP]
[CLS] the age of the top is the same as the widely recognised age for the base of the cambrian period 54 ##2 ##± 0 . 3 my ##a , producing a mis ##ali ##gn ##ment , as the end of the ed ##ica ##rian period should mark the start of the cambrian period . [SEP]
[CLS] the fossil record from the ed ##iac ##aran period is sparse , as more easily fossil ##ized hard - shell ##ed animals had yet to evolve . [SEP]
[CLS] the ed ##iac ##aran bio ##ta include the oldest definite multi ##cellular organisms ( with specialized tissues ) , the most common types of which resemble segment ##ed worms , fr ##ond ##s , disks , or im ##mobile bags . [SEP]
[CLS] ed ##iac ##ara bio ##ta bear little resemblance to modern life ##forms , and their relationship even with the immediately following life ##forms of the cambrian explosion is rather difficult to interpret . [SEP]
[CLS] more than 100 genera have been described , and well known forms include " ark ##aru ##a " , " char ##nia " , " dickinson ##ia " , " ed ##iac ##aria " , " mary ##wad ##ea " , " one ##ga " , " pt ##eri ##dini ##um " , and " yo ##rg ##ia " . [SEP]
[CLS] there is evidence that earth ' s first mass extinction happened during this period when early animals changed the environment . [SEP]
[CLS] the relative proximity of the moon at this time meant that tides were stronger and more rapid than they are now . [SEP]
[CLS] the day was 21 . 9 ##± ##0 . 4 hours , and there were 13 . 1 ##± ##0 . 1 synod ##ic months / year and 400 ##± ##7 solar days / year . [SEP]
