[CLS] in mathematics , a fin ##ita ##ry relation is a property that assigns truth values to finite tu ##ples of elements . [SEP]
[CLS] for a given set of k - tu ##ples , a truth value is assigned to each k - tu ##ple according to whether the property does or does not hold . [SEP]
[CLS] in this section we introduce the concept of a relation with a familiar everyday example . [SEP]
[CLS] consider the relation involving three roles that people might play , expressed in a statement of the form " " x " thinks that " y " likes " z " " . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , the first row says , in effect , " alice thinks that bob likes denise " . [SEP]
[CLS] the relation itself is a mathematical object defined in terms of concepts from set theory ( i . e . , the relation is a subset of the cart ##esian product on { person x , person y , person z } ) , that carries all of the information from the table in one neat package . [SEP]
[CLS] mathematical ##ly , then , a relation is simply an " ordered set " . [SEP]
[CLS] computer scientists , logic ##ians , and mathematicians , however , tend to see different things when they look at these concrete examples and samples of the more general concept of a relation . [SEP]
[CLS] for one thing , databases are designed to deal with empirical data , and experience is always finite , whereas mathematics at the very least concerns itself with potential infinity . [SEP]
[CLS] this difference in perspective brings up a number of ideas that may be useful ##ly introduced at this point , if by no means covered in depth . [SEP]
[CLS] the variable formula _ 1 giving the number of " " places " " in the relation , 3 for the above example , is a non - negative integer , called the relation ' s " ari ##ty " , " adi ##city " , or " dimension " . [SEP]
[CLS] relations with a finite number of places are called " finite - place " or " fin ##ita ##ry " relations . [SEP]
[CLS] it is possible to general ##ize the concept to include " in ##fin ##ita ##ry " relations between in ##fin ##itude ##s of individuals , for example infinite sequences ; however , in this article only fin ##ita ##ry relations are discussed , which will from now on simply be called relations . [SEP]
[CLS] since there is only one 0 - tu ##ple , the so - called empty tu ##ple , there are only two zero - place relations : the one that always holds , and the one that never holds . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , any set ( such as the collection of nobel laureate ##s ) can be viewed as a collection of individuals having some property ( such as that of having been awarded the nobel prize ) . [SEP]
[CLS] relations are classified according to the number of sets in the defining cart ##esian product , in other words , according to the number of terms following " l " . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of a relation " l " over " k " sets , there are " k " + 1 things to specify , namely , the " k " sets plus a subset of their cart ##esian product . [SEP]
[CLS] elements of a relation are more briefly denoted by using bold ##face characters , for example , the constant element a = ( a , . . . , a ) or the variable element x = ( " x " , . . . , " x " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] as a rule , whatever definition best fits the application at hand will be chosen for that purpose , and anything that falls under it will be called a relation for the duration of that discussion . [SEP]
[CLS] if it becomes necessary to distinguish the two definitions , an entity satisfying the second definition may be called an " embedded " or " included " relation . [SEP]
[CLS] it is conventional in applied mathematics , computer science , and statistics to refer to a boo ##lean - valued function like " Æ’ " as a " k " - place pre ##dicate . [SEP]
[CLS] from the more abstract viewpoint of formal logic and model theory , the relation " l " constitutes a " logical model " or a " relational structure " that serves as one of many possible interpretations of some " k " - place pre ##dicate symbol . [SEP]
[CLS] because relations arise in many scientific disciplines as well as in many branches of mathematics and logic , there is considerable variation in terminology . [SEP]
[CLS] this article treats a relation as the set - theo ##ret ##ic extension of a relational concept or term . [SEP]
[CLS] a variant usage reserves the term " relation " to the corresponding logical entity , either the logical comprehension , which is the total ##ity of int ##ens ##ions or abstract properties that all of the elements of the relation in extension have in common , or else the symbols that are taken to denote these elements and int ##ens ##ions . [SEP]
[CLS] the logic ##ian augustus de morgan , in work published around 1860 , was the first to art ##iculate the notion of relation in anything like its present sense . [SEP]
[CLS] he also stated the first formal results in the theory of relations ( on de morgan and relations , see merrill 1990 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] many of their ideas , especially on relations called orders , were summarized in principles of mathematics ( 1903 ) by bertrand russell . [SEP]
[CLS] russell and a . n . whitehead made free use of these results in their " pri ##nc ##ip ##ia math ##ema ##tica " . [SEP]
