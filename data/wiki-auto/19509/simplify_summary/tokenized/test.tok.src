[CLS] in mathematics , a fin ##ita ##ry relation is a property that assigns truth values to finite tu ##ples of elements . [SEP]
[CLS] typically , the property describes a possible connection between the components of a k - tu ##ple . [SEP]
[CLS] for a given set of k - tu ##ples , a truth value is assigned to each k - tu ##ple according to whether the property does or does not hold . [SEP]
[CLS] when " k " = 2 , one has the most common version , a binary relation . [SEP]
[CLS] " relation " is formally defined in the next section . [SEP]
[CLS] in this section we introduce the concept of a relation with a familiar everyday example . [SEP]
[CLS] consider the relation involving three roles that people might play , expressed in a statement of the form " " x " thinks that " y " likes " z " " . [SEP]
[CLS] each row of the table records a fact or makes an assertion of the form " " x " thinks that " y " likes " z " " . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , the first row says , in effect , " alice thinks that bob likes denise " . [SEP]
[CLS] it is usual to write " s " ( alice , bob , denise ) to say the same thing as the first row of the table . [SEP]
[CLS] the relation " s " is a " ter ##nary " relation , since there are " three " items involved in each row . [SEP]
[CLS] the relation itself is a mathematical object defined in terms of concepts from set theory ( i . e . , the relation is a subset of the cart ##esian product on { person x , person y , person z } ) , that carries all of the information from the table in one neat package . [SEP]
[CLS] mathematical ##ly , then , a relation is simply an " ordered set " . [SEP]
[CLS] the table for relation " s " is an extremely simple example of a relational database . [SEP]
[CLS] the theoretical aspects of databases are the specialty of one branch of computer science , while their practical impacts have become all too familiar in our everyday lives . [SEP]
[CLS] computer scientists , logic ##ians , and mathematicians , however , tend to see different things when they look at these concrete examples and samples of the more general concept of a relation . [SEP]
[CLS] for one thing , databases are designed to deal with empirical data , and experience is always finite , whereas mathematics at the very least concerns itself with potential infinity . [SEP]
[CLS] this difference in perspective brings up a number of ideas that may be useful ##ly introduced at this point , if by no means covered in depth . [SEP]
[CLS] the variable formula _ 1 giving the number of " " places " " in the relation , 3 for the above example , is a non - negative integer , called the relation ' s " ari ##ty " , " adi ##city " , or " dimension " . [SEP]
[CLS] a relation with formula _ 1 places is variously called a formula _ 1 " - ar ##y " , a formula _ 1 " - adi ##c " , or a formula _ 1 " - dimensional " relation . [SEP]
[CLS] relations with a finite number of places are called " finite - place " or " fin ##ita ##ry " relations . [SEP]
[CLS] it is possible to general ##ize the concept to include " in ##fin ##ita ##ry " relations between in ##fin ##itude ##s of individuals , for example infinite sequences ; however , in this article only fin ##ita ##ry relations are discussed , which will from now on simply be called relations . [SEP]
[CLS] since there is only one 0 - tu ##ple , the so - called empty tu ##ple , there are only two zero - place relations : the one that always holds , and the one that never holds . [SEP]
[CLS] they are sometimes useful for constructing the base case of an induction argument . [SEP]
[CLS] one - place relations are called una ##ry relations . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , any set ( such as the collection of nobel laureate ##s ) can be viewed as a collection of individuals having some property ( such as that of having been awarded the nobel prize ) . [SEP]
[CLS] two - place relations are called binary relations or , in the past , " d ##yad ##ic relations " . [SEP]
[CLS] a formula _ 1 " - ar ##y " relation is a straightforward general ##ization of a binary relation . [SEP]
[CLS] a relation " l " over the sets " x " , . . . , " x " is a subset of their cart ##esian product , written " l " ⊆ " x " × . . . × " x " . [SEP]
[CLS] relations are classified according to the number of sets in the defining cart ##esian product , in other words , according to the number of terms following " l " . [SEP]
[CLS] hence : relations with more than four terms are usually referred to as " k " - ar ##y or " n " - ar ##y , for example , " a 5 - ar ##y relation " . [SEP]
[CLS] a " k " - ar ##y relation is simply a set of " k " - tu ##ples . [SEP]
[CLS] the second definition makes use of an id ##iom that is common in mathematics , st ##ip ##ulating that " such and such is an " n " - tu ##ple " in order to ensure that such and such a mathematical object is determined by the specification of " n " component mathematical objects . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of a relation " l " over " k " sets , there are " k " + 1 things to specify , namely , the " k " sets plus a subset of their cart ##esian product . [SEP]
[CLS] in the id ##iom , this is expressed by saying that " l " is a ( " k " + 1 ) - tu ##ple . [SEP]
[CLS] a relation " l " over the sets " x " , . . . , " x " is a ( " k " + 1 ) - tu ##ple " l " = ( " x " , . . . , " x " , " g " ( " l " ) ) , where " g " ( " l " ) is a subset of the cart ##esian product " x " × . . . × " x " . [SEP]
[CLS] " g " ( " l " ) is called the " graph " of " l " . [SEP]
[CLS] elements of a relation are more briefly denoted by using bold ##face characters , for example , the constant element a = ( a , . . . , a ) or the variable element x = ( " x " , . . . , " x " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a statement of the form " a is in the relation " l " " or " a sat ##is ##fies " l " " is taken to mean that a is in " l " under the first definition and that a is in " g " ( " l " ) under the second definition . [SEP]
[CLS] as a rule , whatever definition best fits the application at hand will be chosen for that purpose , and anything that falls under it will be called a relation for the duration of that discussion . [SEP]
[CLS] if it becomes necessary to distinguish the two definitions , an entity satisfying the second definition may be called an " embedded " or " included " relation . [SEP]
[CLS] if " l " is a relation over the domains " x " , . . . , " x " , it is conventional to consider a sequence of terms called " variables " , " x " , . . . , " x " , that are said to " range over " the respective domains . [SEP]
[CLS] let a boo ##lean domain b be a two - element set , say , b = { 0 , 1 } , whose elements can be interpreted as logical values , typically 0 = false and 1 = true . [SEP]
[CLS] the characteristic function of the relation " l " , written " ƒ " or χ ( " l " ) , is the boo ##lean - valued function " ƒ " : " x " × . . . × " x " → b , defined in such a way that " ƒ " ( formula _ 15 ) = 1 just in case the " k " - tu ##ple formula _ 15 is in the relation " l " . [SEP]
[CLS] such a function can also be called an indicator function , particularly in probability and statistics , to avoid confusion with the notion of a characteristic function in probability theory . [SEP]
[CLS] it is conventional in applied mathematics , computer science , and statistics to refer to a boo ##lean - valued function like " ƒ " as a " k " - place pre ##dicate . [SEP]
[CLS] from the more abstract viewpoint of formal logic and model theory , the relation " l " constitutes a " logical model " or a " relational structure " that serves as one of many possible interpretations of some " k " - place pre ##dicate symbol . [SEP]
[CLS] because relations arise in many scientific disciplines as well as in many branches of mathematics and logic , there is considerable variation in terminology . [SEP]
[CLS] this article treats a relation as the set - theo ##ret ##ic extension of a relational concept or term . [SEP]
[CLS] a variant usage reserves the term " relation " to the corresponding logical entity , either the logical comprehension , which is the total ##ity of int ##ens ##ions or abstract properties that all of the elements of the relation in extension have in common , or else the symbols that are taken to denote these elements and int ##ens ##ions . [SEP]
[CLS] further , some writers of the latter persuasion introduce terms with more concrete con ##not ##ations , like " relational structure " , for the set - theo ##ret ##ic extension of a given relational concept . [SEP]
[CLS] the logic ##ian augustus de morgan , in work published around 1860 , was the first to art ##iculate the notion of relation in anything like its present sense . [SEP]
[CLS] he also stated the first formal results in the theory of relations ( on de morgan and relations , see merrill 1990 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] charles sanders pei ##rce rest ##ated and extended de morgan ' s results . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 19th century pei ##rce , got ##tl ##ob fr ##ege , georg cantor , richard de ##dek ##ind , and others advanced the theory of relations . [SEP]
[CLS] many of their ideas , especially on relations called orders , were summarized in principles of mathematics ( 1903 ) by bertrand russell . [SEP]
[CLS] russell and a . n . whitehead made free use of these results in their " pri ##nc ##ip ##ia math ##ema ##tica " . [SEP]
