[CLS] stalin ' s deputy instructed the king to make the communists ' candidate , pet ##ru gr ##oza , the prime minister in march 1945 . [SEP]
[CLS] the romanian administration in northern transylvania was soon restored , and gr ##oza ' s government carried out an agrarian reform . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 1947 , the paris peace treaties confirmed the return of northern transylvania to romania , but they also legal ##ized the presence of units of the red army in the country . [SEP]
[CLS] during the soviet occupation of romania , the communist - dominated government called for new elections in 1946 , which were fraudulent ##ly won , with a fabricated 70 % majority of the vote . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , they rapidly established themselves as the dominant political force . [SEP]
[CLS] g ##he ##org ##he g ##he ##org ##hi ##u - de ##j , a communist party leader imprisoned in 1933 , escaped in 1944 to become romania ' s first communist leader . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1947 he and others forced king michael i to abd ##icate and leave the country , and proclaimed romania a people ' s republic . [SEP]
[CLS] romania remained under the direct military occupation and economic control of the ussr until the late 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period , romania ' s vast natural resources were continuously drained by mixed soviet - romanian companies ( so ##vr ##oms ) set up for un ##ila ##tera ##l exploit ##ative purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1948 , the state began to national ##ize private firms and to collect ##iv ##ize agriculture . [SEP]
[CLS] until the early 1960s , the government severely curt ##ailed political liberties and vigorously suppressed any dissent with the help of the sec ##uri ##tate ( the romanian secret police ) . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period the regime launched several campaigns of purge ##s in which numerous " enemies of the state " and " parasite elements " were targeted for different forms of punishment , such as deportation , internal exile , and internment in forced labour camps and prisons , sometimes for life , as well as extra ##ju ##dic ##ial killing . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , anti - communist resistance was one of the most long - lasting in the eastern bloc . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2006 commission estimated the number of direct victims of the communist repression at two million people . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1965 , nicola ##e ce ##aus ##escu came to power and started to conduct the foreign policy more independently from the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , communist romania was the only warsaw pact country which refused to participate in the soviet - led 1968 invasion of czechoslovakia ( with ce ##aus ##escu at the time even publicly condemning the action as " a big mistake , and a serious danger to peace in europe and to the fate of communism in the world " ) ; it was also the only communist state to maintain diplomatic relations with israel after 1967 ' s six - day war ; and established diplomatic relations with west germany the same year . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time , close ties with the arab countries ( and the pl ##o ) allowed romania to play a key role in the israel – egypt and israel – pl ##o peace talks . [SEP]
[CLS] as romania ' s foreign debt sharply increased between 1977 and 1981 ( from us $ 3 billion to $ 10 billion ) , the influence of international financial organizations ( such as the im ##f and the world bank ) grew , gradually conflicting with ce ##aus ##escu ' s auto ##cratic rule . [SEP]
[CLS] the latter eventually initiated a policy of total rei ##mb ##urse ##ment of the foreign debt by imposing aus ##ter ##ity steps that impoverished the population and exhausted the economy . [SEP]
[CLS] the process succeeded in repay ##ing all foreign government debt of romania in 1989 . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time , ce ##aus ##escu greatly extended the authority of the sec ##uri ##tate secret police and imposed a severe cult of personality , which led to a dramatic decrease in the dictator ' s popularity and culminated in his overthrow and eventual execution , together with his wife , in the violent romanian revolution of december 1989 in which thousands were killed or injured . [SEP]
[CLS] the charges for which they were executed were , among others , genocide by starvation . [SEP]
[CLS] after the 1989 revolution , the national salvation front ( ns ##f ) , led by ion il ##ies ##cu , took partial multi - party democratic and free market measures . [SEP]
[CLS] in april 1990 , a sit - in protest contest ##ing the results of that year ' s legislative elections and accusing the ns ##f , including il ##ies ##cu , of being made up of former communists and members of the sec ##uri ##tate — rapidly grew to become what was called the go ##lani ##ad . [SEP]
[CLS] the peaceful demonstrations de ##gen ##erated into violence , prompting the intervention of coal miners summoned by il ##ies ##cu . [SEP]
[CLS] this episode has been documented widely by both local and foreign media , and is remembered as the june 1990 miner ##iad . [SEP]
[CLS] the subsequent di ##sin ##te ##gration of the front produced several political parties , including most notably the social democratic party and the democratic party . [SEP]
[CLS] the former governed romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalition ##s and governments with ion il ##ies ##cu as head of state . [SEP]
[CLS] since then , there have been several other democratic changes of government : in 1996 emil constantine ##scu was elected president , in 2000 il ##ies ##cu returned to power , while tr ##aia ##n bases ##cu was elected in 2004 and narrowly re - elected in 2009 . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 2014 , si ##bi ##u mayor klaus johann ##is was elected president , unexpectedly defeating former prime minister victor pont ##a , who had been in the lead in the opinion polls . [SEP]
[CLS] this surprise victory is attributed by many to the romanian diaspora , of which almost 50 percent voted for io ##han ##nis in the first tour , compared to 16 percent for pont ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] the post - 1989 period is also characterized by the fact that most of the former industrial and economic enterprises which were built and operated during the communist period have been closed , mainly as a result of the policies of privatization of the post - 1989 regimes . [SEP]
[CLS] corruption has also been a major issue in contemporary romanian politics . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 2015 , massive anti - corruption protests which developed in the wake of the cole ##ct ##iv nightclub fire led to the resignation of romania ' s prime minister victor pont ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] during 2017 – 2018 , in response to measures which were perceived to weaken the fight against corruption , some of the biggest protests since 1989 took place in romania , with over 500 , 000 people protesting across the country . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , in recent years , many efforts have been made to tackle corruption . [SEP]
[CLS] a national anti ##cor ##rup ##tion directorate was formed in the country in 2002 , and according to transparency international ' s annual corruption perceptions index , romania has a corruption index similar to croatia and neighbouring hungary . [SEP]
[CLS] after the end of the cold war , romania developed closer ties with western europe and the united states , eventually joining nato in 2004 , and hosting the 2008 summit in bucharest . [SEP]
[CLS] the country applied in june 1993 for membership in the european union and became an associated state of the eu in 1995 , an acc ##eding country in 2004 , and a full member on 1 january 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 2000s , romania enjoyed one of the highest economic growth rates in europe and has been referred at times as " the tiger of eastern europe " . [SEP]
[CLS] this has been accompanied by a significant improvement in living standards as the country successfully reduced internal poverty and established a functional democratic state . [SEP]
[CLS] however , romania ' s development suffered a major set ##back during the late - 2000s recession leading to a large gross domestic product contraction and budget deficit in 2009 . [SEP]
[CLS] this led to romania borrowing from the international monetary fund . [SEP]
[CLS] the worse ##ning economic conditions led to unrest and triggered a political crisis in 2012 . [SEP]
[CLS] romania still faces problems related to infrastructure , medical services , education , and corruption . [SEP]
[CLS] near the end of 2013 , the economist reported romania again enjoying ' booming ' economic growth at 4 . 1 % that year , with wages rising fast and a lower unemployment than in britain . [SEP]

[CLS] in 2016 the human development index ranked romania as a nation of " very high human development " . [SEP]
