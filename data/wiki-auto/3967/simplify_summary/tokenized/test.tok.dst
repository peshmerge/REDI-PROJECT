[CLS] bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower frequencies in a continuous band of frequencies . [SEP]
[CLS] it is typically measured in her ##tz , and depending on context , may specifically refer to " pass ##band bandwidth " or " base ##band bandwidth " . [SEP]
[CLS] pass ##band bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower cut ##off frequencies of , for example , a band - pass filter , a communication channel , or a signal spectrum . [SEP]
[CLS] base ##band bandwidth applies to a low - pass filter or base ##band signal ; the bandwidth is equal to its upper cut ##off frequency . [SEP]
[CLS] bandwidth in her ##tz is a central concept in many fields , including electronics , information theory , digital communications , radio communications , signal processing , and spectroscopy and is one of the deter ##mina ##nts of the capacity of a given communication channel . [SEP]
[CLS] a key characteristic of bandwidth is that any band of a given width can carry the same amount of information , regardless of where that band is located in the frequency spectrum . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , a 3 khz band can carry a telephone conversation whether that band is at base ##band ( as in a pots telephone line ) or mod ##ulated to some higher frequency . [SEP]
[CLS] bandwidth is a key concept in many telecommunications applications . [SEP]
[CLS] in radio communications , for example , bandwidth is the frequency range occupied by a mod ##ulated carrier signal . [SEP]
[CLS] an fm radio receiver ' s tune ##r spans a limited range of frequencies . [SEP]
[CLS] a government agency ( such as the federal communications commission in the united states ) may app ##ort ##ion the regional ##ly available bandwidth to broadcast license holders so that their signals do not mutually interfere . [SEP]
[CLS] in this context , bandwidth is also known as channel spa ##cing . [SEP]
[CLS] for other applications there are other definitions . [SEP]
[CLS] one definition of bandwidth , for a system , could be the range of frequencies over which the system produces a specified level of performance . [SEP]
[CLS] a less strict and more practically useful definition will refer to the frequencies beyond which performance is degraded . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of frequency response , degradation could , for example , mean more than 3 db below the maximum value or it could mean below a certain absolute value . [SEP]
[CLS] as with any definition of the " width " of a function , many definitions are suitable for different purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] in the context of , for example , the sampling theorem and ny ##quist sampling rate , bandwidth typically refers to base ##band bandwidth . [SEP]
[CLS] in the context of ny ##quist symbol rate or shannon - hartley channel capacity for communication systems it refers to pass ##band bandwidth . [SEP]
[CLS] the ray ##leigh bandwidth of a simple radar pulse is defined as the inverse of its duration . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , a one - micro ##se ##con ##d pulse has a ray ##leigh bandwidth of one mega ##her ##tz . [SEP]
[CLS] the essential bandwidth is defined as the portion of a signal spectrum in the frequency domain which contains most of the energy of the signal . [SEP]
[CLS] in some contexts , the signal bandwidth in her ##tz refers to the frequency range in which the signal ' s spectral density ( in w / hz or v / hz ) is non ##zer ##o or above a small threshold value . [SEP]
[CLS] that definition is used in calculations of the lowest sampling rate that will satisfy the sampling theorem . [SEP]
[CLS] the threshold value is often defined relative to the maximum value , and is most commonly the , that is the point where the spectral density is half its maximum value ( or the spectral amplitude , in v or v / hz , is 70 . 7 % of its maximum ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the word bandwidth applies to signals as described above , but it could also apply to " systems " , for example filters or communication channels . [SEP]
[CLS] to say that a system has a certain bandwidth means that the system can process signals of that bandwidth , or that the system reduces the bandwidth of a white noise input to that bandwidth . [SEP]
[CLS] the 3 db bandwidth of an electronic filter or communication channel is the part of the system ' s frequency response that lies within 3 db of the response at its peak , which in the pass ##band filter case is typically at or near its center frequency , and in the low - pass filter is near 0 her ##tz . [SEP]
[CLS] if the maximum gain is 0 db , the 3 db bandwidth is the frequency range where the gain is more than − ##3 db , or the at ##ten ##uation is less than 3 db . [SEP]
[CLS] this is also the range of frequencies where the amplitude gain is above 70 . 7 % of the maximum amplitude gain , and the power gain is above half the maximum power gain . [SEP]
[CLS] this same " half - power gain " convention is also used in spectral width , and more generally for extent of functions as full width at half maximum ( f ##w ##hm ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in electronic filter design , a filter specification may require that within the filter pass ##band , the gain is nominally 0 db ± a small number of db , for example within the ± ##1 db interval . [SEP]
[CLS] in the stop ##band ( s ) , the required at ##ten ##uation in db is above a certain level , for example > 100 db . [SEP]
[CLS] in a transition band the gain is not specified . [SEP]
[CLS] in this case , the filter bandwidth corresponds to the pass ##band width , which in this example is the 1 db - bandwidth . [SEP]
[CLS] if the filter shows amplitude ripple within the pass ##band , the " x " db point refers to the point where the gain is " x " db below the nominal pass ##band gain rather than " x " db below the maximum gain . [SEP]
[CLS] in communication systems , in calculations of the shannon – hartley channel capacity , bandwidth refers to the 3 db - bandwidth . [SEP]
[CLS] in calculations of the maximum symbol rate , the ny ##quist sampling rate , and maximum bit rate according to the hartley formula , the bandwidth refers to the frequency range within which the gain is non - zero , or the gain in db is below a very large value . [SEP]
[CLS] the fact that in equivalent base ##band models of communication systems , the signal spectrum consists of both negative and positive frequencies , can lead to confusion about bandwidth , since they are sometimes referred to only by the positive half , and one will occasionally see expressions such as formula _ 1 , where formula _ 2 is the total bandwidth ( i . e . the maximum pass ##band bandwidth of the carrier - mod ##ulated rf signal and the minimum pass ##band bandwidth of the physical pass ##band channel ) , and formula _ 3 is the positive bandwidth ( the base ##band bandwidth of the equivalent channel model ) . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , the base ##band model of the signal would require a low - pass filter with cut ##off frequency of at least formula _ 3 to stay intact , and the physical pass ##band channel would require a pass ##band filter of at least formula _ 2 to stay intact . [SEP]
[CLS] in signal processing and control theory the bandwidth is the frequency at which the closed - loop system gain drops 3 db below peak . [SEP]
[CLS] in basic electric circuit theory , when studying band - pass and band - reject filters , the bandwidth represents the distance between the two points in the frequency domain where the signal is formula _ 6 of the maximum signal amplitude ( half power ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the field of antennas , two different methods of expressing relative bandwidth are used for narrow ##band and wide ##band antennas . [SEP]
[CLS] for either , a set of criteria is established to define the extent ##s of the bandwidth , such as input imp ##edance , pattern , or polar ##ization . [SEP]
[CLS] " percent bandwidth " , usually used for narrow ##band antennas , is used defined as formula _ 7 . [SEP]
[CLS] the theoretical limit to percent bandwidth is 200 % , which occurs for formula _ 8 . [SEP]
[CLS] " fraction ##al bandwidth or ratio bandwidth " , usually used for wide ##band antennas , is defined as formula _ 9 and is typically presented in the form of formula _ 10 . [SEP]
[CLS] fraction ##al bandwidth is used for wide ##band antennas because of the compression of the percent bandwidth that occurs mathematical ##ly with percent bandwidth ##s above 100 % , which corresponds to a fraction ##al bandwidth of 3 : 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] a related concept is the spectral line ##wi ##dt ##h of the radiation emitted by excited atoms . [SEP]
