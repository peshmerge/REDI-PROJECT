[CLS] it is typically measured in her ##tz , and depending on context , may specifically refer to " pass ##band bandwidth " or " base ##band bandwidth " . [SEP]
[CLS] pass ##band bandwidth is the difference between the upper and lower cut ##off frequencies of , for example , a band - pass filter , a communication channel , or a signal spectrum . [SEP]
[CLS] a key characteristic of bandwidth is that any band of a given width can carry the same amount of information , regardless of where that band is located in the frequency spectrum . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , a 3 khz band can carry a telephone conversation whether that band is at base ##band ( as in a pots telephone line ) or mod ##ulated to some higher frequency . [SEP]
[CLS] in radio communications , for example , bandwidth is the frequency range occupied by a mod ##ulated carrier signal . [SEP]
[CLS] a government agency ( such as the federal communications commission in the united states ) may app ##ort ##ion the regional ##ly available bandwidth to broadcast license holders so that their signals do not mutually interfere . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of frequency response , degradation could , for example , mean more than 3 db below the maximum value or it could mean below a certain absolute value . [SEP]
[CLS] in the context of , for example , the sampling theorem and ny ##quist sampling rate , bandwidth typically refers to base ##band bandwidth . [SEP]
[CLS] in the context of ny ##quist symbol rate or shannon - hartley channel capacity for communication systems it refers to pass ##band bandwidth . [SEP]
[CLS] the ray ##leigh bandwidth of a simple radar pulse is defined as the inverse of its duration . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , a one - micro ##se ##con ##d pulse has a ray ##leigh bandwidth of one mega ##her ##tz . [SEP]
[CLS] the essential bandwidth is defined as the portion of a signal spectrum in the frequency domain which contains most of the energy of the signal . [SEP]
[CLS] in some contexts , the signal bandwidth in her ##tz refers to the frequency range in which the signal ' s spectral density ( in w / hz or v / hz ) is non ##zer ##o or above a small threshold value . [SEP]
[CLS] the word bandwidth applies to signals as described above , but it could also apply to " systems " , for example filters or communication channels . [SEP]
[CLS] the 3 db bandwidth of an electronic filter or communication channel is the part of the system ' s frequency response that lies within 3 db of the response at its peak , which in the pass ##band filter case is typically at or near its center frequency , and in the low - pass filter is near 0 her ##tz . [SEP]
[CLS] this is also the range of frequencies where the amplitude gain is above 70 . 7 % of the maximum amplitude gain , and the power gain is above half the maximum power gain . [SEP]
[CLS] this same " half - power gain " convention is also used in spectral width , and more generally for extent of functions as full width at half maximum ( f ##w ##hm ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in electronic filter design , a filter specification may require that within the filter pass ##band , the gain is nominally 0 db ± a small number of db , for example within the ± ##1 db interval . [SEP]
[CLS] in calculations of the maximum symbol rate , the ny ##quist sampling rate , and maximum bit rate according to the hartley formula , the bandwidth refers to the frequency range within which the gain is non - zero , or the gain in db is below a very large value . [SEP]
[CLS] the fact that in equivalent base ##band models of communication systems , the signal spectrum consists of both negative and positive frequencies , can lead to confusion about bandwidth , since they are sometimes referred to only by the positive half , and one will occasionally see expressions such as formula _ 1 , where formula _ 2 is the total bandwidth ( i . e . [SEP]
[CLS] the maximum pass ##band bandwidth of the carrier - mod ##ulated rf signal and the minimum pass ##band bandwidth of the physical pass ##band channel ) , and formula _ 3 is the positive bandwidth ( the base ##band bandwidth of the equivalent channel model ) . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , the base ##band model of the signal would require a low - pass filter with cut ##off frequency of at least formula _ 3 to stay intact , and the physical pass ##band channel would require a pass ##band filter of at least formula _ 2 to stay intact . [SEP]
[CLS] in signal processing and control theory the bandwidth is the frequency at which the closed - loop system gain drops 3 db below peak . [SEP]
[CLS] in basic electric circuit theory , when studying band - pass and band - reject filters , the bandwidth represents the distance between the two points in the frequency domain where the signal is formula _ 6 of the maximum signal amplitude ( half power ) . [SEP]
[CLS] for either , a set of criteria is established to define the extent ##s of the bandwidth , such as input imp ##edance , pattern , or polar ##ization . [SEP]
[CLS] fraction ##al bandwidth is used for wide ##band antennas because of the compression of the percent bandwidth that occurs mathematical ##ly with percent bandwidth ##s above 100 % , which corresponds to a fraction ##al bandwidth of 3 : 1 . [SEP]
