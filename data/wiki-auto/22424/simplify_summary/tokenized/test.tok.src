[CLS] the theory of rec ##ap ##it ##ulation , also called the bio ##gen ##etic law or embryo ##logical parallel ##ism — often expressed using ernst ha ##eck ##el ' s phrase " onto ##geny rec ##ap ##it ##ulates ph ##yl ##ogen ##y " — is a historical hypothesis that the development of the embryo of an animal , from fe ##rti ##lization to ge ##station or hatch ##ing ( onto ##geny ) , goes through stages resembling or representing successive adult stages in the evolution of the animal ' s remote ancestors ( ph ##yl ##ogen ##y ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it was formulated in the 1820s by etienne ser ##res based on the work of johann friedrich me ##cke ##l , after whom it is also known as me ##cke ##l – ser ##res law . [SEP]
[CLS] since embryo ##s also evolve in different ways , the short ##coming ##s of the theory had been recognized by the early 20th century , and it had been relegated to " biological mythology " by the mid - 20th century . [SEP]
[CLS] analog ##ies to rec ##ap ##it ##ulation theory have been formulated in other fields , including cognitive development and art criticism . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea of rec ##ap ##it ##ulation was first formulated in biology from the 1790 ##s onwards by the german natural philosophers johann friedrich me ##cke ##l , etienne ser ##res , and carl friedrich kiel ##meyer , after which , marcel danes ##i states , it soon gained the status of a supposed bio ##gen ##etic law . [SEP]
[CLS] the embryo ##logical theory was formal ##ised by ser ##res in 1824 – 26 , based on me ##cke ##l ' s work , in what became known as the " me ##cke ##l - ser ##res law " . [SEP]
[CLS] this attempted to link comparative embryo ##logy with a " pattern of unification " in the organic world . [SEP]
[CLS] it was supported by etienne geoff ##roy saint - hi ##lai ##re , and became a prominent part of his ideas . [SEP]
[CLS] it suggested that past transformations of life could have been through environmental causes working on the embryo , rather than on the adult as in lamar ##cki ##sm . [SEP]
[CLS] these naturalist ##ic ideas led to disagreements with georges cu ##vier . [SEP]
[CLS] the theory was widely supported in the edinburgh and london schools of higher anatomy around 1830 , notably by robert edmond grant , but was opposed by karl ernst von bae ##r ' s ideas of diver ##gence , and attacked by richard owen in the 1830s . [SEP]
[CLS] ernst ha ##eck ##el ( 1834 – 1919 ) attempted to synth ##es ##ize the ideas of lamar ##cki ##sm and goethe ' s " nat ##ur ##phi ##los ##op ##hi ##e " with charles darwin ' s concepts . [SEP]
[CLS] while often seen as rejecting darwin ' s theory of branching evolution for a more linear lamar ##cki ##an view of progressive evolution , this is not accurate : ha ##eck ##el used the lamar ##cki ##an picture to describe the onto ##gen ##etic and phylogenetic history of individual species , but agreed with darwin about the branching of all species from one , or a few , original ancestors . [SEP]
[CLS] since early in the twentieth century , ha ##eck ##el ' s " bio ##gen ##etic law " has been ref ##uted on many fronts . [SEP]
[CLS] ha ##eck ##el formulated his theory as " onto ##geny rec ##ap ##it ##ulates ph ##yl ##ogen ##y " . [SEP]
[CLS] the notion later became simply known as the rec ##ap ##it ##ulation theory . [SEP]
[CLS] onto ##geny is the growth ( size change ) and development ( structure change ) of an individual organism ; ph ##yl ##ogen ##y is the evolutionary history of a species . [SEP]
[CLS] ha ##eck ##el claimed that the development of advanced species passes through stages represented by adult organisms of more primitive species . [SEP]
[CLS] otherwise put , each successive stage in the development of an individual represents one of the adult forms that appeared in its evolutionary history . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , ha ##eck ##el proposed that the ph ##ary ##nge ##al grooves between the ph ##ary ##nge ##al arches in the neck of the human embryo not only roughly resembled gill slits of fish , but directly represented an adult " fish ##like " developmental stage , sign ##ifying a fish ##like ancestor . [SEP]
[CLS] embryo ##nic ph ##ary ##nge ##al slits , which form in many animals when the thin branch ##ial plates separating ph ##ary ##nge ##al pouch ##es and ph ##ary ##nge ##al grooves per ##for ##ate , open the ph ##ary ##nx to the outside . [SEP]
[CLS] ph ##ary ##nge ##al arches appear in all te ##tra ##pod embryo ##s : in mammals , the first ph ##ary ##nge ##al arch develops into the lower jaw ( me ##cke ##l ' s cart ##ila ##ge ) , the mall ##eus and the st ##apes . [SEP]
[CLS] ha ##eck ##el produced several embryo drawings that often over ##em ##pha ##si ##zed similarities between embryo ##s of related species . [SEP]
[CLS] modern biology rejects the literal and universal form of ha ##eck ##el ' s theory , such as its possible application to behaviour ##al onto ##geny , i . e . the psycho ##moto ##r development of young animals and human children . [SEP]
[CLS] ha ##eck ##el ' s drawings mis ##re ##pres ##ented observed human embryo ##nic development to such an extent that he attracted the opposition of several members of the scientific community , including the ana ##tom ##ist wilhelm his , who had developed a rival " causal - mechanical theory " of human embryo ##nic development . [SEP]
[CLS] his ' s work specifically criticised ha ##eck ##el ' s methodology , arguing that the shapes of embryo ##s were caused most immediately by mechanical pressures resulting from local differences in growth . [SEP]
[CLS] these differences were , in turn , caused by " here ##dity " . [SEP]
[CLS] his compared the shapes of embryo ##nic structures to those of rubber tubes that could be slit and bent , illustrating these comparisons with accurate drawings . [SEP]
[CLS] stephen jay gould noted in his 1977 book " onto ##geny and ph ##yl ##ogen ##y " that his ' s attack on ha ##eck ##el ' s rec ##ap ##it ##ulation theory was far more fundamental than that of any empirical critic , as it effectively stated that ha ##eck ##el ' s " bio ##gen ##etic law " was irrelevant . [SEP]
[CLS] darwin proposed that embryo ##s resembled each other since they shared a common ancestor , which presumably had a similar embryo , but that development did not necessarily rec ##ap ##it ##ulate ph ##yl ##ogen ##y : he saw no reason to suppose that an embryo at any stage resembled an adult of any ancestor . [SEP]
[CLS] darwin supposed further that embryo ##s were subject to less intense selection pressure than adults , and had therefore changed less . [SEP]
[CLS] modern evolutionary developmental biology ( ev ##o - dev ##o ) follows von bae ##r , rather than darwin , in pointing to active evolution of embryo ##nic development as a significant means of changing the morphology of adult bodies . [SEP]
[CLS] two of the key principles of ev ##o - dev ##o , namely that changes in the timing ( het ##ero ##ch ##ron ##y ) and positioning ( het ##ero ##top ##y ) within the body of aspects of embryo ##nic development would change the shape of a descendant ' s body compared to an ancestor ' s , were however first formulated by ha ##eck ##el in the 1870s . [SEP]
[CLS] these elements of his thinking about development have thus survived , whereas his theory of rec ##ap ##it ##ulation has not . [SEP]
[CLS] the ha ##eck ##elia ##n form of rec ##ap ##it ##ulation theory is considered defunct . [SEP]
[CLS] embryo ##s do undergo a period where their morphology is strongly shaped by their phylogenetic position , rather than selective pressures , but that means only that they resemble other embryo ##s at that stage , not ancestral adults as ha ##eck ##el had claimed . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea that onto ##geny rec ##ap ##it ##ulates ph ##yl ##ogen ##y has been applied to some other areas . [SEP]
[CLS] english philosopher herbert spencer was one of the most energetic proponents of evolutionary ideas to explain many phenomena . [SEP]
[CLS] g . stanley hall used ha ##eck ##el ' s theories as the basis for his theories of child development . [SEP]
[CLS] his most influential work , " adolescence : its psychology and its relations to physiology , anthropology , sociology , sex , crime , religion and education " in 1904 suggested that each individual ' s life course rec ##ap ##it ##ulated humanity ' s evolution from " savage ##ry " to " civilization " . [SEP]
[CLS] though he has influenced later childhood development theories , hall ' s conception is now generally considered racist . [SEP]
[CLS] developmental psychologist jean pia ##get favored a weaker version of the formula , according to which onto ##geny " parallels " ph ##yl ##ogen ##y because the two are subject to similar external constraints . [SEP]
[CLS] the austrian pioneer of psycho ##analysis , si ##gm ##und freud , also favored ha ##eck ##el ' s doctrine . [SEP]
[CLS] he was trained as a biologist under the influence of rec ##ap ##it ##ulation theory during its hey ##day , and retained a lamar ##cki ##an outlook with justification from the rec ##ap ##it ##ulation theory . [SEP]
[CLS] freud also distinguished between physical and mental rec ##ap ##it ##ulation , in which the differences would become an essential argument for his . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late 20th century , studies of symbolism and learning in the field of cultural anthropology suggested that " both biological evolution and the stages in the child ' s cognitive development follow much the same progression of evolutionary stages as that suggested in the archaeological record " . [SEP]
[CLS] the music ##ologist richard tar ##us ##kin in 2005 applied the phrase " onto ##geny becomes ph ##yl ##ogen ##y " to the process of creating and rec ##ast ##ing art history , often to assert a perspective or argument . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the peculiar development of the works by modernist composer arnold sc ##hoe ##nberg ( here an " onto ##geny " ) is generalized in many histories into a " ph ##yl ##ogen ##y " – a historical development ( " evolution " ) of western music toward at ##onal styles of which sc ##hoe ##nberg is a representative . [SEP]
[CLS] such his ##tori ##og ##raph ##ies of the " collapse of traditional ton ##ality " are fault ##ed by art historians as asserting a rhetoric ##al rather than historical point about ton ##ality ' s " collapse " . [SEP]
[CLS] tar ##us ##kin also developed a variation of the motto into the pun " onto ##geny rec ##ap ##it ##ulates onto ##logy " to ref ##ute the concept of " absolute music " advancing the socio - artistic theories of the music ##ologist carl dahl ##haus . [SEP]
[CLS] onto ##logy is the investigation of what exactly something is , and tar ##us ##kin asserts that an art object becomes that which society and succeeding generations made of it . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , johann sebastian bach ' s " st . john passion " , composed in the 1720 ##s , was appropriated by the nazi regime in the 1930s for propaganda . [SEP]
[CLS] tar ##us ##kin claims the historical development of the " st john passion " ( its onto ##geny ) as a work with an anti - semitic message does , in fact , inform the work ' s identity ( its onto ##logy ) , even though that was an unlikely concern of the composer . [SEP]
[CLS] music or even an abstract visual artwork can not be truly autonomous ( " absolute " ) because it is defined by its historical and social reception . [SEP]
