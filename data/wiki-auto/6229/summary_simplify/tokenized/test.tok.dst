[CLS] col ##oss ##us was a set of computers developed by british code ##breakers in the years 1943 – 1945 to help in the crypt ##analysis of the loren ##z cipher . [SEP]
[CLS] col ##oss ##us was designed by research telephone engineer tommy flowers to solve a problem posed by mathematician max newman at the government code and cy ##pher school ( g ##c & cs ) at b ##let ##ch ##ley park . [SEP]
[CLS] it has sometimes been erroneously stated that turing designed col ##oss ##us to aid the crypt ##analysis of the enigma . [SEP]
[CLS] an improved col ##oss ##us mark 2 that used shift registers to qui ##nt ##up ##le the processing speed , first worked on 1 june 1944 , just in time for the normandy landings on d - day . [SEP]
[CLS] b ##let ##ch ##ley park ' s use of these machines allowed the allies to obtain a vast amount of high - level military intelligence from intercepted radio ##tel ##eg ##raphy messages between the german high command ( " ok ##w " ) and their army commands throughout occupied europe . [SEP]
[CLS] the existence of the col ##oss ##us machines was kept secret until the mid - 1970s ; the machines and the plans for building them had previously been destroyed in the 1960s as part of the effort to maintain the secrecy of the project . [SEP]
[CLS] this deprived most of those involved with col ##oss ##us of the credit for pioneering electronic digital computing during their lifetime ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this led the british to call en ##cr ##yp ##ted german tel ##ep ##rin ##ter traffic " fish " , and the unknown machine and its intercepted messages " tun ##ny " ( tuna ##fish ) . [SEP]
[CLS] before the germans increased the security of their operating procedures , british crypt ##anal ##yst ##s diagnosed how the unseen machine functioned and built an imitation of it called " british tun ##ny " . [SEP]
[CLS] it was de ##duced that the machine had twelve wheels and used a ve ##rna ##m cipher ##ing technique on message characters in the standard 5 - bit it ##a ##2 telegraph code . [SEP]
[CLS] it did this by combining the plain ##text characters with a stream of key characters using the x ##or boo ##lean function to produce the cipher ##text . [SEP]
[CLS] in august 1941 , a blu ##nder by german operators led to the transmission of two versions of the same message with identical machine settings . [SEP]
[CLS] then bill tu ##tte , a newly arrived member of the research section , used this key stream to work out the logical structure of the loren ##z machine . [SEP]
[CLS] with a sufficiently random key stream , a ve ##rna ##m cipher removes the natural language property of a plain ##text message of having an uneven frequency distribution of the different characters , to produce a uniform distribution in the cipher ##text . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the crypt ##anal ##yst ##s worked out that by examining the frequency distribution of the character - to - character changes in the cipher ##text , instead of the plain characters , there was a departure from uniform ##ity which provided a way into the system . [SEP]
[CLS] these patterns were set up on the loren ##z machine and then used for a fixed period of time for a succession of different messages . [SEP]
[CLS] the second task was " wheel setting " , which worked out the start positions of the wheels for a particular message , and could only be attempted once the cam patterns were known . [SEP]
[CLS] to discover the start position of the " chi " wheels for a message , col ##oss ##us compared two character streams , counting statistics from the evaluation of program ##mable boo ##lean functions . [SEP]
[CLS] the two streams were the cipher ##text , which was read at high speed from a paper tape , and the key stream , which was generated internally , in a simulation of the unknown german machine . [SEP]
[CLS] after a succession of different col ##oss ##us runs to discover the likely " chi " - wheel settings , they were checked by examining the frequency distribution of the characters in processed cipher ##text . [SEP]
[CLS] by using differ ##en ##cing and knowing that the " psi " wheels did not advance with each character , tu ##tte worked out that trying just two difference ##d bits ( impulse ##s ) of the " chi " - stream against the difference ##d cipher ##text would produce a stat ##istic that was non - random . [SEP]
[CLS] if this number exceeded a pre - defined threshold value known as the " set total " , it was printed out . [SEP]
[CLS] the crypt ##anal ##yst would examine the print ##out to determine which of the put ##ative start positions was most likely to be the correct one for the " chi " - 1 and " chi " - 2 wheels . [SEP]
[CLS] this technique would then be applied to other pairs of , or single , impulse ##s to determine the likely start position of all five " chi " wheels . [SEP]
[CLS] this was the section at b ##let ##ch ##ley park led by major ralph test ##er where the bulk of the dec ##ry ##pt ##ing work was done by manual and linguistic methods . [SEP]
[CLS] col ##oss ##us could also derive the start position of the " psi " and motor wheels , but this was not much done until the last few months of the war , when there were plenty of col ##oss ##i available and the number of tun ##ny messages had declined . [SEP]
[CLS] col ##oss ##us was developed for the " newman ##ry " , the section headed by the mathematician max newman that was responsible for machine methods against the twelve - rotor loren ##z s ##z ##40 / 42 on - line tel ##ep ##rin ##ter cipher machine ( code named tun ##ny , for tuna ##fish ) . [SEP]
[CLS] although it proved the concept of machine analysis for this part of the process , it was initially unreliable . [SEP]
[CLS] the electro - mechanical parts were relatively slow and it was difficult to sync ##hr ##onis ##e two loop ##ed paper tapes , one containing the en ##ci ##pher ##ed message , and the other representing part of the key stream of the loren ##z machine , also the tapes tended to stretch when being read at up to 2000 characters per second . [SEP]
[CLS] tommy flowers mbe was a senior electrical engineer and head of the switching group at the post office research station at doll ##is hill . [SEP]
[CLS] prior to his work on col ##oss ##us , he had been involved with g ##c & cs at b ##let ##ch ##ley park from february 1941 in an attempt to improve the bomb ##es that were used in the crypt ##analysis of the german enigma cipher machine . [SEP]
[CLS] he was not impressed by the system of a key tape that had to be kept sync ##hr ##onis ##ed with the message tape and , on his own initiative , he designed an electronic machine which eliminated the need for the key tape by having an electronic analogue of the loren ##z ( tun ##ny ) machine . [SEP]
[CLS] he presented this design to max newman in february 1943 , but the idea that the one to two thousand the ##rmi ##onic valves ( vacuum tubes and thy ##rat ##rons ) proposed , could work together re ##lia ##bly , was greeted with great sc ##ept ##ici ##sm , so more robinson ##s were ordered from doll ##is hill . [SEP]
[CLS] flowers persisted with the idea and obtained support from the director of the research station , w gordon ra ##dley . [SEP]
[CLS] flowers and his team of some fifty people in the switching group spent eleven months from early february 1943 designing and building a machine that di ##sp ##ense ##d with the second tape of the heath robinson , by generating the wheel patterns electronically . [SEP]
[CLS] it performed sat ##is ##fa ##ctor ##ily at doll ##is hill on 8 december 1943 and was dismantled and shipped to b ##let ##ch ##ley park , where it was delivered on 18 january and re - assembled by harry fen ##som and don ho ##rwood . [SEP]
[CLS] four of these were ordered in march 1944 and by the end of april the number on order had been increased to twelve . [SEP]
[CLS] doll ##is hill was put under pressure to have the first of these working by 1 june . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time of v - e day there were ten col ##oss ##i working at b ##let ##ch ##ley park and a start had been made on ass ##em ##bling an eleventh . [SEP]
[CLS] most of the design of the electronics was the work of tommy flowers , assisted by william chandler , sidney broad ##hurst and allen co ##om ##bs ; with erie sp ##ei ##ght and arnold lynch developing the photo ##ele ##ctric reading mechanism . [SEP]
[CLS] co ##om ##bs remembered flowers , having produced a rough draft of his design , tearing it into pieces that he handed out to his colleagues for them to do the detailed design and get their team to manufacture it . [SEP]
[CLS] this was arranged in a continuous loop so that it could be read and re - read multiple times – there being no internal store for the data . [SEP]
[CLS] the design overcame the problem of sync ##hr ##oni ##zing the electronics with the speed of the message tape , by generating a clock signal from reading its sp ##rock ##et holes . [SEP]
[CLS] the speed of operation was thus limited by the mechanics of reading the tape . [SEP]
[CLS] flowers designed a 6 - character shift register , which was used both for computing the delta function ( δ ##z ) and for testing five different possible starting points of tun ##ny ' s wheels in the five processors . [SEP]
[CLS] this was performed by the wren ##s who stuck the two ends together using bo ##sti ##k glue , ensuring that there was a 150 - character length of blank tape between the end and the start of the message . [SEP]
[CLS] using a special hand punch they inserted a start hole between the third and fourth channels 2 ⁄ sp ##rock ##et holes from the end of the blank section , and a stop hole between the fourth and fifth channels 1 ⁄ sp ##rock ##et holes from the end of the characters of the message . [SEP]
[CLS] these were read by specially positioned photo ##cel ##ls and indicated when the message was about to start and when it ended . [SEP]
[CLS] the two - tape beds ##tead design had been carried on from heath robinson so that one tape could be loaded whilst the previous one was being run . [SEP]
[CLS] after performing various reset ##ting and zero ##izing tasks , the wren operators would , under instruction from the crypt ##anal ##yst , operate the " set total " decade switches and the k ##2 panel switches to set the desired algorithm . [SEP]
[CLS] the input data for the five parallel processors was read from the loop ##ed message paper tape and the electronic pattern generators for the " chi " , " psi " and motor wheels . [SEP]
[CLS] the programs for the processors were set and held on the switches and jack panel connections . [SEP]
[CLS] each processor could evaluate a boo ##lean function and count and display the number of times it yielded the specified value of " false " ( 0 ) or " true " ( 1 ) for each pass of the message tape . [SEP]
[CLS] input to the processors came from two sources , the shift registers from tape reading and the thy ##rat ##ron rings that em ##ulated the wheels of the tun ##ny machine . [SEP]
[CLS] the characters on the paper tape were called z and the characters from the tun ##ny em ##ulator were referred to by the greek letters that bill tu ##tte had given them when working out the logical structure of the machine . [SEP]
[CLS] on the selection panel , switches specified either z or δ ##z , either formula _ 1 or δ ##form ##ula _ 1 and either formula _ 5 or δ ##form ##ula _ 5 for the data to be passed to the jack field and ' k ##2 switch panel ' . [SEP]
[CLS] these signals from the wheel simulator ##s could be specified as stepping on with each new pass of the message tape or not . [SEP]
[CLS] such a two - wheel run was called a long run , taking on average eight minutes unless the parallel ##ism was ut ##ilised to cut the time by a factor of five . [SEP]
[CLS] initially , after the initial long run , the choice of next algorithm to be tried was specified by the crypt ##anal ##yst . [SEP]
[CLS] although the col ##oss ##us was the first of the electronic digital machines with program ##ma ##bility , albeit limited by modern standards , it was not a general - purpose machine , being designed for a range of crypt ##anal ##ytic tasks , most involving counting the results of evaluating boo ##lean algorithms . [SEP]
[CLS] however , university of san francisco professor benjamin wells has shown that if all ten col ##oss ##us machines made were rear ##rang ##ed in a specific cluster , then the entire set of computers could have simulated a universal turing machine , and thus be turing complete . [SEP]
[CLS] the notion of a computer as a general purpose machine — that is , as more than a cal ##cula ##tor devoted to solving difficult but specific problems — did not become prominent until after world war ii . [SEP]
[CLS] col ##oss ##us and the reasons for its construction were highly secret , and remained so for 30 years after the war . [SEP]
[CLS] consequently , it was not included in the history of computing hardware for many years , and flowers and his associates were deprived of the recognition they were due . [SEP]
[CLS] col ##oss ##i 1 to 10 were dismantled after the war and parts returned to the post office . [SEP]
[CLS] some parts , san ##itis ##ed as to their original purpose , were taken to max newman ' s royal society computing machine laboratory at manchester university . [SEP]
[CLS] a small number of people who were associated with col ##oss ##us — and knew that large - scale , reliable , high - speed electronic digital computing devices were feasible — played significant roles in early computer work in the uk and probably in the us . [SEP]
[CLS] however , being so secret , it had little direct influence on the development of later computers ; it was ed ##vac that was the seminal computer architecture of the time . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1972 herman gold ##sti ##ne , who was unaware of col ##oss ##us and its legacy to the projects of people such as alan turing ( ace ) , max newman ( manchester computers ) and harry hu ##ske ##y ( bend ##ix g - 15 ) , wrote that , [SEP]
[CLS] rand ##ell ' s efforts started to bear fruit in the mid - 1970s , after the secrecy about b ##let ##ch ##ley park was broken when group captain winter ##bot ##ham published his book " the ultra secret " in 1974 . [SEP]
[CLS] the optical tape reader might have posed the biggest problem , but dr . arnold lynch , its original designer , was able to redesign it to his own original specification . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 2007 , to celebrate the project completion and to mark the start of a fundraising initiative for the national museum of computing , a cipher challenge pitted the rebuilt col ##oss ##us against radio amateurs worldwide in being first to receive and deco ##de three messages en ##ci ##pher ##ed using the loren ##z s ##z ##42 and transmitted from radio station dl ##0 ##hn ##f in the " heinz nix ##dorf museums ##for ##um " computer museum . [SEP]
[CLS] the challenge was easily won by radio amateur joachim sc ##hu ##th , who had carefully prepared for the event and developed his own signal processing and code - breaking code using ada . [SEP]
[CLS] the col ##oss ##us team were hampered by their wish to use world war ii radio equipment , delaying them by a day because of poor reception conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , the victor ' s 1 . 4 ghz laptop , running his own code , took less than a minute to find the settings for all 12 wheels . [SEP]
[CLS] the german code ##breaker said : " my laptop digest ##ed cipher ##text at a speed of 1 . 2 million characters per second — 240 times faster than col ##oss ##us . [SEP]
[CLS] " on the strength of today ' s performance col ##oss ##us is as good as it was six decades ago " , commented tony sale . [SEP]
[CLS] " we are delighted to have produced a fitting tribute to the people who worked at b ##let ##ch ##ley park and whose brain ##power devised these fantastic machines which broke these cipher ##s and shortened the war by many months . " [SEP]
[CLS] this was sheer coincidence as it pre - dates the public release of information about col ##oss ##us , or even its name . [SEP]
