November retained its name (from the Latin "novem" meaning "nine") when January and February were added to the Roman calendar.
November is a month of late spring in the Southern Hemisphere and late autumn in the Northern Hemisphere.
In Ancient Rome, Ludi Plebeii was held from November 4–17, Epulum Jovis was held on November 13 and Brumalia celebrations began on November 24.
These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar.
Brumaire and Frimaire were the months on which November fell in the French Republican Calendar.
