[CLS] concrete , usually portland cement concrete ( for its visual resemblance to portland stone ) , is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement ( cement paste ) that harden ##s over time â€” most frequently in the past a lime - based cement bind ##er , such as lime put ##ty , but sometimes with other hydraulic cement ##s , such as a calcium al ##umi ##nate cement or portland cement . [SEP]
[CLS] it is distinguished from other , non - cement ##iti ##ous types of concrete all binding some form of aggregate together , including asphalt concrete with a bit ##umen bind ##er , which is frequently used for road surfaces , and polymer concrete ##s that use polymers as a bind ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] when aggregate is mixed with dry portland cement and water , the mixture forms a fluid sl ##ur ##ry that is easily poured and molded into shape . [SEP]
[CLS] the cement reacts with the water and other ingredients to form a hard matrix that binds the materials together into a durable stone - like material that has many uses . [SEP]
[CLS] often , additive ##s ( such as po ##zzo ##lan ##s or super ##pl ##astic ##izer ##s ) are included in the mixture to improve the physical properties of the wet mix or the finished material . [SEP]
