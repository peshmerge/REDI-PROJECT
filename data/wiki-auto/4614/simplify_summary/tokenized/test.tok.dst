[CLS] the boeing 747 is an american wide - body commercial jet airline ##r and cargo aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] the first wide - body airplane produced , it was the first plane dubbed a " ju ##mbo jet " . [SEP]
[CLS] its distinctive hum ##p upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft has made it one of the most recognizable aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] manufactured by boeing ' s commercial airplane unit in the united states , the 747 was originally planned to have 150 percent greater capacity than the boeing 70 ##7 , a common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s . [SEP]
[CLS] first flown commercially in 1970 , the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years . [SEP]
[CLS] the quad ##jet 747 uses a double - deck configuration for part of its length and is available in passenger , freighter , and other versions . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing designed the 747 ' s hum ##p - like upper deck to serve as a first - class lounge or extra seating , and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing expected super ##sonic airline ##rs — the development of which was announced in the early 1960s — to render the 747 and other sub ##sonic airline ##rs obsolete , while the demand for sub ##sonic cargo aircraft would remain robust well into the future . [SEP]
[CLS] though the 747 was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold , production passed 1 , 000 in 1993 . [SEP]
[CLS] by june 2019 , 1 , 55 ##4 aircraft had been built , with 20 of the 747 - 8 variants remaining on order . [SEP]
[CLS] s of 2017 , 60 of the jets have been lost in accidents in which a total of people died . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 400 , the most common variant in service , has a high - sub ##sonic cruise speed of mach 0 . 85 – 0 . 85 ##5 ( up to 570 mph ) with an intercontinental range of 7 , 260 nautical miles ( 8 , 350 statute miles or 13 , 450 km ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 400 can carry 41 ##6 passengers in a typical three - class layout , 52 ##4 passengers in a typical two - class layout , or 660 passengers in a high – density one - class configuration . [SEP]
[CLS] the newest version of the aircraft , the 747 - 8 , is in production and received certification in 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] deliveries of the 747 - 8 ##f freighter version began in october 2011 ; deliveries of the 747 - 8 ##i passenger version began in may 2012 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1963 , the united states air force started a series of study projects on a very large strategic transport aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] although the c - 141 star ##lift ##er was being introduced , officials believed that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed , especially to carry cargo that would not fit in any existing aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] these studies led to initial requirements for the c ##x - heavy logistics system ( c ##x - h ##ls ) in march 1964 for an aircraft with a load capacity of 1800 ##00 lb and a speed of mach 0 . 75 ( 500 mph ) , and an un ##re ##fu ##ele ##d range of 5000 nmi with a payload of 115 ##00 ##0 lb . [SEP]
[CLS] the payload bay had to be 17 ft wide by 13 . 5 ft high and 100 ft long with access through doors at the front and rear . [SEP]
[CLS] the desire to keep the number of engines to four required new engine designs with greatly increased power and better fuel economy . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 1964 , air ##frame proposals arrived from boeing , douglas , general dynamics , lockheed , and martin marie ##tta ; engine proposals were submitted by general electric , curtiss - wright , and pratt & whitney . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing , douglas , and lockheed were given additional study contracts for the air ##frame , along with general electric and pratt & whitney for the engines . [SEP]
[CLS] the air ##frame proposals shared a number of features . [SEP]
[CLS] as the c ##x - h ##ls needed to be able to be loaded from the front , a door had to be included where the cockpit usually was . [SEP]
[CLS] all of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area ; douglas had a small " pod " just forward and above the wing , lockheed used a long " spine " running the length of the aircraft with the wing spa ##r passing through it , while boeing blended the two , with a longer pod that ran from just behind the nose to just behind the wing . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1965 , lockheed ' s aircraft design and general electric ' s engine design were selected for the new c - 5 galaxy transport , which was the largest military aircraft in the world at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] the nose door and raised cockpit concepts would be carried over to the design of the 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 was conceived while air travel was increasing in the 1960s . [SEP]
[CLS] the era of commercial jet transportation , led by the enormous popularity of the boeing 70 ##7 and douglas dc - 8 , had revolution ##ized long - distance travel . [SEP]
[CLS] even before it lost the c ##x - h ##ls contract , boeing was asked by juan trip ##pe , president of pan american world airways ( pan am ) , one of their most important airline customers , to build a passenger aircraft more than twice the size of the 70 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] during this time , airport congestion , worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft , became a problem that trip ##pe thought could be addressed by a larger new aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1965 , joe su ##tter was transferred from boeing ' s 737 development team to manage the design studies for the new airline ##r , already assigned the model number 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] su ##tter began a design study with pan am and other airlines , to better understand their requirements . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time , it was widely thought that the 747 would eventually be superseded by super ##sonic transport aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing responded by designing the 747 so that it could be adapted easily to carry freight and remain in production even if sales of the passenger version declined . [SEP]
[CLS] in the freighter role , the clear need was to support the container ##ized shipping method ##ologies that were being widely introduced at about the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] standard shipping containers are 8 ft square at the front ( slightly higher due to attachment points ) and available in 20 and lengths . [SEP]
[CLS] this meant that it would be possible to support a 2 - wide 2 - high stack of containers two or three ranks deep with a fuselage size similar to the earlier c ##x - h ##ls project . [SEP]
[CLS] in april 1966 , pan am ordered 25 747 - 100 aircraft for us $ 525 million . [SEP]
[CLS] during the ceremonial 747 contract - signing banquet in seattle on boeing ' s 50th anniversary , juan trip ##pe predicted that the 747 would be " . . . a great weapon for peace , competing with intercontinental missiles for mankind ' s destiny " . [SEP]
[CLS] as launch customer , and because of its early involvement before placing a formal order , pan am was able to influence the design and development of the 747 to an extent un ##mat ##ched by a single airline before or since . [SEP]
[CLS] ultimately , the high - winged c ##x - h ##ls boeing design was not used for the 747 , although technologies developed for their bid had an influence . [SEP]
[CLS] the original design included a full - length double - deck fuselage with eight - across seating and two aisles on the lower deck and seven - across seating and two aisles on the upper deck . [SEP]
[CLS] however , concern over evacuation routes and limited cargo - carrying capability caused this idea to be scrapped in early 1966 in favor of a wider single deck design . [SEP]
[CLS] the cockpit was , therefore , placed on a shortened upper deck so that a freight - loading door could be included in the nose cone ; this design feature produced the 747 ' s distinctive " bulge " . [SEP]
[CLS] in early models it was not clear what to do with the small space in the pod behind the cockpit , and this was initially specified as a " lounge " area with no permanent seating . [SEP]
[CLS] ( a different configuration that had been considered in order to keep the flight deck out of the way for freight loading had the pilots below the passengers , and was dubbed the " ant ##ea ##ter " . ) [SEP]
[CLS] one of the principal technologies that enabled an aircraft as large as the 747 to be drawn up was the high - bypass turbo ##fan engine . [SEP]
[CLS] the engine technology was thought to be capable of delivering double the power of the earlier turbo ##jet ##s while consuming one – third less fuel . [SEP]
[CLS] general electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the c - 5 galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later . [SEP]
[CLS] pratt & whitney was also working on the same principle and , by late 1966 , boeing , pan am and pratt & whitney agreed to develop a new engine , designated the j ##t ##9 ##d to power the 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] the project was designed with a new methodology called fault tree analysis , which allowed the effects of a failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems . [SEP]
[CLS] to address concerns about safety and fly ##ability , the 747 ' s design included structural red ##unda ##ncy , redundant hydraulic systems , quad ##rup ##le main landing gear and dual control surfaces . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , some of the most advanced high - lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design , to allow it to operate from existing airports . [SEP]
[CLS] these included sl ##ats running almost the entire length of the wing , as well as complex three - part slot ##ted flaps along the trailing edge of the wing . [SEP]
[CLS] the wing ' s complex three - part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non - deployed configuration . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing agreed to deliver the first 747 to pan am by the end of 1969 . [SEP]
[CLS] the delivery date left 28 months to design the aircraft , which was two - thirds of the normal time . [SEP]
[CLS] the schedule was so fast - paced that the people who worked on it were given the nickname " the incredible ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] developing the aircraft was such a technical and financial challenge that management was said to have " bet the company " when it started the project . [SEP]
[CLS] as boeing did not have a plant large enough to assemble the giant airline ##r , they chose to build a new plant . [SEP]
[CLS] the company considered locations in about 50 cities , and eventually decided to build the new plant some 30 mi north of seattle on a site adjoining a military base at pain ##e field near everett , washington . [SEP]
[CLS] it bought the 780 acre site in june 1966 . [SEP]
[CLS] developing the 747 had been a major challenge , and building its assembly plant was also a huge undertaking . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing president william m . allen asked malcolm t . stamp ##er , then head of the company ' s turbine division , to oversee construction of the everett factory and to start production of the 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] to level the site , more than 4 e ##6 ##cu ##yd of earth had to be moved . [SEP]
[CLS] time was so short that the 747 ' s full - scale mock - up was built before the factory roof above it was finished . [SEP]
[CLS] the plant is the largest building by volume ever built , and has been substantially expanded several times to permit construction of other models of boeing wide - body commercial jets . [SEP]
[CLS] before the first 747 was fully assembled , testing began on many components and systems . [SEP]
[CLS] one important test involved the evacuation of 560 volunteers from a cabin mock - up via the aircraft ' s emergency chu ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] the first full - scale evacuation took two and a half minutes instead of the maximum of 90 seconds mandated by the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , and several volunteers were injured . [SEP]
[CLS] subsequent test evacuation ##s achieved the 90 - second goal but caused more injuries . [SEP]
[CLS] most problematic was evacuation from the aircraft ' s upper deck ; instead of using a conventional slide , volunteer passengers escaped by using a harness attached to a reel . [SEP]
[CLS] tests also involved taxi ##ing such a large aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing built an unusual training device known as " wa ##dd ##ell ' s wagon " ( named for a 747 test pilot , jack wa ##dd ##ell ) that consisted of a mock - up cockpit mounted on the roof of a truck . [SEP]
[CLS] while the first 747 ##s were still being built , the device allowed pilots to practice taxi maneuvers from a high upper - deck position . [SEP]
[CLS] on september 30 , 1968 , the first 747 was rolled out of the everett assembly building before the world ' s press and representatives of the 26 airlines that had ordered the airline ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] over the following months , preparations were made for the first flight , which took place on february 9 , 1969 , with test pilots jack wa ##dd ##ell and brien w ##y ##gle at the controls and jess wall ##ick at the flight engineer ' s station . [SEP]
[CLS] despite a minor problem with one of the flaps , the flight confirmed that the 747 handled extremely well . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 was found to be largely immune to " dutch roll " , a phenomenon that had been a major hazard to the early swept - wing jets . [SEP]
[CLS] during later stages of the flight test program , flutter testing showed that the wings suffered os ##ci ##llation under certain conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] this difficulty was partly solved by reducing the stiff ##ness of some wing components . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a particularly severe high - speed flutter problem was solved only by insert ##ing depleted uranium counter ##weight ##s as ballast in the out ##board engine na ##cel ##les of the early 747 ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this measure caused anxiety when these aircraft crashed , for example el al flight 1862 at amsterdam in 1992 with 282 kg of uranium in the tail ##plane ( horizontal stabilize ##r ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the flight test program was hampered by problems with the 747 ' s j ##t ##9 ##d engines . [SEP]
[CLS] difficulties included engine stalls caused by rapid throttle movements and distortion of the turbine cas ##ings after a short period of service . [SEP]
[CLS] the problems delayed 747 deliveries for several months ; up to 20 aircraft at the everett plant were stranded while awaiting engine installation . [SEP]
[CLS] the program was further delayed when one of the five test aircraft suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at rent ##on municipal airport , site of the company ' s rent ##on factory . [SEP]
[CLS] on december 13 , 1969 a test aircraft was being taken to have test equipment removed and a cabin installed when pilot ralph c . coke ##ly under ##shot the airport ' s short runway . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 ' s right , outer landing gear was torn off and two engine na ##cel ##les were damaged . [SEP]
[CLS] however , these difficulties did not prevent boeing from taking a test aircraft to the 28th paris air show in mid - 1969 , where it was displayed to the public for the first time . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 received its faa air ##worth ##iness certificate in december 1969 , clearing it for introduction into service . [SEP]
[CLS] the huge cost of developing the 747 and building the everett factory meant that boeing had to borrow heavily from a banking syndicate . [SEP]
[CLS] during the final months before delivery of the first aircraft , the company had to repeatedly request additional funding to complete the project . [SEP]
[CLS] had this been refused , boeing ' s survival would have been threatened . [SEP]
[CLS] the firm ' s debt exceeded $ 2 billion , with the $ 1 . 2 billion owed to the banks setting a record for all companies . [SEP]
[CLS] allen later said , " it was really too large a project for us . " [SEP]
[CLS] ultimately , the gamble succeeded , and boeing held a monopoly in very large passenger aircraft production for many years . [SEP]
[CLS] on january 15 , 1970 , first lady of the united states pat nixon christ ##ened pan am ' s first 747 , at dull ##es international airport ( later washington dull ##es international airport ) in the presence of pan am chairman na ##jee ##b hal ##aby . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of champagne , red , white , and blue water was sprayed on the aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 entered service on january 22 , 1970 , on pan am ' s new york – london route ; the flight had been planned for the evening of january 21 , but engine over ##hea ##ting made the original aircraft un ##usa ##ble . [SEP]
[CLS] finding a substitute delayed the flight by more than six hours to the following day when clip ##per victor was used . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 enjoyed a fairly smooth introduction into service , overcoming concerns that some airports would not be able to accommodate an aircraft that large . [SEP]
[CLS] although technical problems occurred , they were relatively minor and quickly solved . [SEP]
[CLS] after the aircraft ' s introduction with pan am , other airlines that had bought the 747 to stay competitive began to put their own 747 ##s into service . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing estimated that half of the early 747 sales were to airlines des ##iring the aircraft ' s long range rather than its payload capacity . [SEP]
[CLS] while the 747 had the lowest potential operating cost per seat , this could only be achieved when the aircraft was fully loaded ; costs per seat increased rapidly as o ##cc ##up ##ancy declined . [SEP]
[CLS] a moderately loaded 747 , one with only 70 percent of its seats occupied , used more than 95 percent of the fuel needed by a fully occupied 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , many flag - carriers purchased the 747 due to its prestige " even if it made no sense economically " to operate . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1970s and 1980s , there was often over 30 regularly scheduled 747 ##s at john f . kennedy international airport . [SEP]
[CLS] the recession of 1969 - 1970 greatly affected boeing . [SEP]
[CLS] for the year and a half after september 1970 it only sold two 747 ##s in the world , and did not sell any to an american carrier for almost three years . [SEP]
[CLS] when economic problems in the us and other countries after the 1973 oil crisis led to reduced passenger traffic , several airlines found they did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 economically , and they replaced them with the smaller and recently introduced mcdonnell douglas dc - 10 and lockheed l - 101 ##1 tri ##star tri ##jet wide bodies ( and later the 76 ##7 and a ##30 ##0 / a ##31 ##0 twin ##jet ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] having tried replacing coach seats on its 747 ##s with piano bars in an attempt to attract more customers , american airlines eventually relegated its 747 ##s to cargo service and in 1983 exchanged them with pan am for smaller aircraft ; delta air lines also removed its 747 ##s from service after several years . [SEP]
[CLS] later , delta acquired 747 ##s again in 2008 as part of its merger with northwest airlines , although it retired the 747 - 400 fleet in december 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] international flights bypass ##ing traditional hub airports and landing at smaller cities became more common throughout the 1980s , thus er ##od ##ing the 747 ' s original market . [SEP]
[CLS] many international carriers continued to use the 747 on pacific routes . [SEP]
[CLS] in japan , 747 ##s on domestic routes were configured to carry nearly the maximum passenger capacity . [SEP]
[CLS] after the initial 747 - 100 , boeing developed the - 100 ##b , a higher maximum takeoff weight ( mt ##ow ) variant , and the - 100 ##sr ( short range ) , with higher passenger capacity . [SEP]
[CLS] increased maximum takeoff weight allows aircraft to carry more fuel and have longer range . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 200 model followed in 1971 , featuring more powerful engines and a higher mt ##ow . [SEP]
[CLS] passenger , freighter and combination passenger - freighter versions of the - 200 were produced . [SEP]
[CLS] the shortened 747 ##sp ( special performance ) with a longer range was also developed , and entered service in 1976 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 line was further developed with the launch of the 747 - 300 in 1980 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 300 series resulted from boeing studies to increase the seating capacity of the 747 , during which modifications such as fuselage plug ##s and extending the upper deck over the entire length of the fuselage were rejected . [SEP]
[CLS] the first 747 - 300 , completed in 1983 , included a stretched upper deck , increased cruise speed , and increased seating capacity . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 300 variant was previously designated 747 ##su ##d for stretched upper deck , then 747 - 200 sud , followed by 747 ##eu ##d , before the 747 - 300 designation was used . [SEP]
[CLS] passenger , short range and combination freighter - passenger versions of the 300 series were produced . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1985 , development of the longer range 747 - 400 began . [SEP]
[CLS] the variant had a new glass cockpit , which allowed for a cockpit crew of two instead of three , new engines , lighter construction materials , and a redesigned interior . [SEP]
[CLS] development cost soared , and production delays occurred as new technologies were incorporated at the request of airlines . [SEP]
[CLS] insufficient workforce experience and reliance on overtime contributed to early production problems on the 747 - 400 . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 400 entered service in 1989 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1991 , a record - breaking 1 , 08 ##7 passengers were airlift ##ed aboard a 747 to israel as part of operation solomon . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 remained the heaviest commercial aircraft in regular service until the debut of the anton ##ov an - 124 rus ##lan in 1982 ; variants of the 747 - 400 surpassed the an - 124 ' s weight in 2000 . [SEP]
[CLS] the anton ##ov an - 225 " mri ##ya " cargo transport , which debuted in 1988 , remains the world ' s largest aircraft by several measures ( including the most accepted measures of maximum takeoff weight and length ) ; one aircraft has been completed and is in service as of 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] the scaled composite ##s st ##rat ##ola ##un ##ch is the currently the largest aircraft by wingspan . [SEP]
[CLS] since the arrival of the 747 - 400 , several stretching schemes for the 747 have been proposed . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing announced the larger 747 - 500 ##x and - 600 ##x preliminary designs in 1996 . [SEP]
[CLS] the new variants would have cost more than us $ 5 billion to develop , and interest was not sufficient to launch the program . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2000 , boeing offered the more modest 747 ##x and 747 ##x stretch derivatives as alternatives to the airbus a ##3 ##xx . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the 747 ##x family was unable to attract enough interest to enter production . [SEP]
[CLS] a year later , boeing switched from the 747 ##x studies to pursue the sonic cruiser , and after the sonic cruiser program was put on hold , the 78 ##7 dream ##liner . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the ideas developed for the 747 ##x were used on the 747 - 400 ##er , a longer range variant of the 747 - 400 . [SEP]
[CLS] after several variants were proposed but later abandoned , some industry observers became skeptical of new aircraft proposals from boeing . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in early 2004 , boeing announced tentative plans for the 747 advanced that were eventually adopted . [SEP]
[CLS] similar in nature to the 747 - x , the stretched 747 advanced used technology from the 78 ##7 to modern ##ize the design and its systems . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 remained the largest passenger airline ##r in service until the airbus a ##38 ##0 began airline service in 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] on november 14 , 2005 , boeing announced it was launching the 747 advanced as the boeing 747 - 8 . [SEP]
[CLS] the last 747 - 400 ##s were completed in 2009 . [SEP]
[CLS] s of 2011 , most orders of the 747 - 8 have been for the freighter variant . [SEP]
[CLS] on february 8 , 2010 , the 747 - 8 freighter made its maiden flight . [SEP]
[CLS] the first delivery of the 747 - 8 went to cargo ##lux in 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1 , 500 ##th produced boeing 747 was delivered in june 2014 . [SEP]
[CLS] in january 2016 , boeing stated it was reducing 747 - 8 production to six a year beginning in september 2016 , inc ##ur ##ring a $ 56 ##9 million post - tax charge against its fourth - quarter 2015 profits . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of 2015 , the company had 20 orders outstanding . [SEP]
[CLS] on january 29 , 2016 , boeing announced that it had begun the preliminary work on the modifications to a commercial 747 - 8 for the next air force one presidential aircraft , expected to be operational by 2020 . [SEP]
[CLS] on july 12 , 2016 , boeing announced that it had finalized terms of acquisition with volga - d ##ne ##pr group for 20 747 - 8 freighter ##s , valued at $ 7 . 58 billion at list prices . [SEP]
[CLS] four aircraft were delivered beginning in 2012 . [SEP]
[CLS] volga - d ##ne ##pr group is the parent of three major russian air - freight carriers – volga - d ##ne ##pr airlines , air ##bridge ##car ##go airlines and at ##ran airlines . [SEP]
[CLS] the new 747 - 8 freighter ##s will replace air ##bridge ##car ##go ' s current 747 - 400 aircraft and expand the airline ' s fleet and will be acquired through a mix of direct purchases and leasing over the next six years , boeing said . [SEP]
[CLS] on july 27 , 2016 , in its quarterly report to the securities and exchange commission , boeing discussed the potential termination of 747 production due to insufficient demand and market for the aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] with a firm order back ##log of 21 aircraft and a production rate of six per year , program accounting has been reduced to 1 , 555 aircraft , and the 747 line could be closed in the third quarter of 2019 . [SEP]
[CLS] in october 2016 , ups airlines ordered 14 - 8 ##fs to add capacity , along with 14 options , which it took in february 2018 bringing the total number of - 8 ##fs ordered to 28 . [SEP]
[CLS] the back ##log then stood at 25 aircraft , though several of these are orders from airlines that no longer intend to take delivery . [SEP]
[CLS] deliveries are scheduled through 202 ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the boeing 747 is a large , wide - body ( two - aisle ) airline ##r with four wing - mounted engines . [SEP]
[CLS] its wings have a high sweep angle of 37 . 5 degrees for a fast , efficient cruise speed of mach 0 . 84 to 0 . 88 , depending on the variant . [SEP]
[CLS] the sweep also reduces the wingspan , allowing the 747 to use existing hangar ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] its seating capacity is over 36 ##6 with a 3 – 4 – 3 seat arrangement ( a cross section of 3 seats , an aisle , 4 seats , another aisle , and 3 seats ) in economy class and a 2 – 3 – 2 layout in first class on the main deck . [SEP]
[CLS] the upper deck has a 3 – 3 seat arrangement in economy class and a 2 – 2 layout in first class . [SEP]
[CLS] raised above the main deck , the cockpit creates a hum ##p . [SEP]
[CLS] this raised cockpit allows front loading of cargo on freight variants . [SEP]
[CLS] the upper deck behind the cockpit provides space for a lounge and / or extra seating . [SEP]
[CLS] the " stretched upper deck " became available as an alternative on the 747 - 100 ##b variant and later as standard beginning on the 747 - 300 . [SEP]
[CLS] the upper deck was stretched more on the 747 - 8 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 cockpit roof section also has an escape hatch from which crew can exit during the events of an emergency if they cannot do so through the cabin . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 ' s maximum takeoff weight ranges from 73 ##5 , 000 pounds ( 333 , 400 kg ) for the - 100 to 97 ##0 , 000 lb ( 43 ##9 , 98 ##5 kg ) for the - 8 . [SEP]
[CLS] its range has increased from 5 , 300 nautical miles ( 6 , 100 mi , 9 , 800 km ) on the - 100 to 8 , 000 nmi ( 9 , 200 mi , 14 , 81 ##5 km ) on the - 8 ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 has redundant structures along with four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears each with four wheels ; these provide a good spread of support on the ground and safety in case of tire blow - outs . [SEP]
[CLS] the main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others are not functioning properly . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 also has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple - slot ##ted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard - length runways . [SEP]
[CLS] for transportation of spare engines , the 747 can accommodate a non - functioning fifth - pod engine under the aircraft ' s port wing between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage . [SEP]
[CLS] this fifth engine mount point is also used by virgin orbit ' s launcher ##one program . [SEP]
[CLS] virgin orbit ' s 747 - 400 , dubbed cosmic girl , carries the orbital - class rocket to cruise altitude , where the rocket is deployed and then carries its small satellite payload the rest of the way to space . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 100 was the original variant launched in 1966 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 200 soon followed , with its launch in 1968 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 300 was launched in 1980 and was followed by the 747 - 400 in 1985 . [SEP]
[CLS] ultimately , the 747 - 8 was announced in 2005 . [SEP]
[CLS] several versions of each variant have been produced , and many of the early variants were in production simultaneously . [SEP]
[CLS] the international civil aviation organization ( icao ) class ##ifies variants using a shortened code formed by combining the model number and the variant design ##ator ( e . g . " b ##7 ##41 " for all - 100 models ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the first 747 - 100 ##s were built with six upper deck windows ( three per side ) to accommodate upstairs lounge areas . [SEP]
[CLS] later , as airlines began to use the upper deck for premium passenger seating instead of lounge space , boeing offered a ten - window upper deck as an option . [SEP]
[CLS] some early - 100 ##s were retro ##fi ##tted with the new configuration . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 100 was equipped with pratt & whitney j ##t ##9 ##d - 3a engines . [SEP]
[CLS] no freighter version of this model was developed , but many 747 - 100 ##s were converted into freighter ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] a total of 168 747 - 100 ##s were built ; 167 were delivered to customers , while boeing kept the prototype , " city of everett " . [SEP]
[CLS] responding to requests from japanese airlines for a high - capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities , boeing developed the 747 ##sr as a short - range version of the 747 - 100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability . [SEP]
[CLS] with increased economy class seating , up to 49 ##8 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 ##sr had an economic design life objective of 52 , 000 flights during 20 years of operation , compared to 24 , 600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial 747 ##sr model , the - 100 ##sr , had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from a greater number of takeoff ##s and landings . [SEP]
[CLS] extra structural support was built into the wings , fuselage , and the landing gear along with a 20 % reduction in fuel capacity . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial order for the - 100 ##sr – four aircraft for japan air lines ( ja ##l , later japan airlines ) – was announced on october 30 , 1972 ; roll ##out occurred on august 3 , 1973 , and the first flight took place on august 31 , 1973 . [SEP]
[CLS] the type was certified by the faa on september 26 , 1973 , with the first delivery on the same day . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 100 ##sr entered service with ja ##l , the type ' s sole customer , on october 7 , 1973 , and typically operated flights within japan . [SEP]
[CLS] seven - 100 ##sr ##s were built between 1973 and 1975 , each with a 520 ##00 ##0 lb mt ##ow and pratt & whitney j ##t ##9 ##d - 7 ##a engines der ##ated to 430 ##00 lb ##f of thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] following the - 100 ##sr , boeing produced the - 100 ##bs ##r , a 747 ##sr variant with increased takeoff weight capability . [SEP]
[CLS] debuting in 1978 , the - 100 ##bs ##r also incorporated structural modifications for a high cycle - to - flying hour ratio ; a related standard - 100 ##b model debuted in 1979 . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 100 ##bs ##r first flew on november 3 , 1978 , with first delivery to all nippon airways ( ana ) on december 21 , 1978 . [SEP]
[CLS] a total of twenty - 100 ##bs ##rs were produced for ana and ja ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 100 ##bs ##r had a 600 , 000 lb mt ##ow and was powered by the same j ##t ##9 ##d - 7 ##a or general electric cf ##6 - 45 engines used on the - 100 ##sr . [SEP]
[CLS] ana operated this variant on domestic japanese routes with 45 ##5 or 45 ##6 seats until retiring its last aircraft in march 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1986 , two - 100 ##bs ##r sud models , featuring the stretched upper deck ( sud ) of the - 300 , were produced for ja ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] the type ' s maiden flight occurred on february 26 , 1986 , with faa certification and first delivery on march 24 , 1986 . [SEP]
[CLS] ja ##l operated the - 100 ##bs ##r sud with 56 ##3 seats on domestic routes until their retirement in the third quarter of 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] while only two - 100 ##bs ##r sud ##s were produced , in theory , standard - 100 ##bs can be modified to the sud certification . [SEP]
[CLS] overall , twenty - nine 747 ##sr ##s were built , consisting of seven - 100 ##sr ##s , twenty - 100 ##bs ##rs , and two - 100 ##bs ##r sud ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 100 ##b model was developed from the - 100 ##sr , using its stronger air ##frame and landing gear design . [SEP]
[CLS] the type had an increased fuel capacity of 480 ##70 us ##gal , allowing for a 5000 nmi range with a typical 45 ##2 - passenger payload , and an increased mt ##ow of 750 ##00 ##0 lb was offered . [SEP]
[CLS] the first - 100 ##b order , one aircraft for iran air , was announced on june 1 , 1978 . [SEP]
[CLS] this aircraft first flew on june 20 , 1979 , received faa certification on august 1 , 1979 , and was delivered the next day . [SEP]
[CLS] nine - 100 ##bs were built , one for iran air and eight for saudi arabian airlines . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike the original - 100 , the - 100 ##b was offered with pratt & whitney j ##t ##9 ##d - 7 ##a , general electric cf ##6 - 50 , or rolls - royce rb ##21 ##1 - 52 ##4 engines . [SEP]
[CLS] however , only rb ##21 ##1 - 52 ##4 ( saudi ##a ) and j ##t ##9 ##d - 7 ##a ( iran air ) engines were ordered . [SEP]
[CLS] the last 747 - 100 ##b , ep - ia ##m was retired by iran air in 2014 , the last commercial operator of the 747 - 100 and - 100 ##b . [SEP]
[CLS] the development of the 747 ##sp stemmed from a joint request between pan american world airways and iran air , who were looking for a high - capacity airline ##r with enough range to cover pan am ' s new york – middle eastern routes and iran air ' s planned tehran – new york route . [SEP]
[CLS] the tehran – new york route , when launched , was the longest non - stop commercial flight in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 ##sp is 48 ft shorter than the 747 - 100 . [SEP]
[CLS] fuselage sections were eliminated fore and aft of the wing , and the center section of the fuselage was redesigned to fit mating fuselage sections . [SEP]
[CLS] the sp ' s flaps used a simplified single - slot ##ted configuration . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 ##sp , compared to earlier variants , had a tape ##ring of the aft upper fuselage into the em ##pen ##nage , a double - hi ##nged rudder , and longer vertical and horizontal stabilize ##rs . [SEP]
[CLS] power was provided by pratt & whitney j ##t ##9 ##d - 7 ( a / f / j / f ##w ) or rolls - royce rb ##21 ##1 - 52 ##4 engines . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 ##sp was granted a supplemental certificate on february 4 , 1976 and entered service with launch customers pan am and iran air that same year . [SEP]
[CLS] the aircraft was chosen by airlines wishing to serve major airports with short runways . [SEP]
[CLS] a total of 45 747 ##sp ##s were built , with the 44th 747 ##sp delivered on august 30 , 1982 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1987 , boeing re - opened the 747 ##sp production line after five years to build one last 747 ##sp for an order by the united arab emirates government . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to airline use , one 747 ##sp was modified for the nasa / german aerospace center sofia experiment . [SEP]
[CLS] iran air is the last civil operator of the type ; its final 747 - sp ( ep - ia ##c ) was to be retired in june 2016 . [SEP]
[CLS] while the 747 - 100 powered by pratt & whitney j ##t ##9 ##d - 3a engines offered enough payload and range for medium - haul operations , it was marginal for long - haul route sectors . [SEP]
[CLS] the demand for longer range aircraft with increased payload quickly led to the improved - 200 , which featured more powerful engines , increased mt ##ow , and greater range than the - 100 . [SEP]
[CLS] a few early - 200 ##s retained the three - window configuration of the - 100 on the upper deck , but most were built with a ten - window configuration on each side . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 200 was produced in passenger ( - 200 ##b ) , freighter ( - 200 ##f ) , convertible ( - 200 ##c ) , and comb ##i ( - 200 ##m ) versions . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 200 ##b was the basic passenger version , with increased fuel capacity and more powerful engines ; it entered service in february 1971 . [SEP]
[CLS] in its first three years of production , the - 200 was equipped with pratt & whitney j ##t ##9 ##d - 7 engines ( initially the only engine available ) . [SEP]
[CLS] range with a full passenger load started at over 5000 nmi and increased to 6000 nmi with later engines . [SEP]
[CLS] most - 200 ##bs had an internally stretched upper deck , allowing for up to 16 passenger seats . [SEP]
[CLS] the freighter model , the 747 - 200 ##f , could be fitted with or without a side cargo door , and had a capacity of 105 tons ( 95 . 3 tonnes ) and an mt ##ow of up to 83 ##3 , 000 lb ( 37 ##8 , 000 kg ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it entered service in 1972 with lu ##ft ##han ##sa . [SEP]
[CLS] the convertible version , the 747 - 200 ##c , could be converted between a passenger and a freighter or used in mixed configurations , and featured re ##movable seats and a nose cargo door . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 200 ##c could also be fitted with an optional side cargo door on the main deck . [SEP]
[CLS] the comb ##i model , the 747 - 200 ##m , could carry freight in the rear section of the main deck via a side cargo door . [SEP]
[CLS] a re ##movable partition on the main deck separated the cargo area at the rear from the passengers at the front . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 200 ##m could carry up to 238 passengers in a three - class configuration with cargo carried on the main deck . [SEP]
[CLS] the model was also known as the 747 - 200 comb ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] as on the - 100 , a stretched upper deck ( sud ) modification was later offered . [SEP]
[CLS] a total of 10 converted 747 - 200 ##s were operated by k ##lm . [SEP]
[CLS] union de transports ae ##rien ##s ( uta ) also had two aircraft converted . [SEP]
[CLS] after launching the - 200 with pratt & whitney j ##t ##9 ##d - 7 engines , on august 1 , 1972 boeing announced that it had reached an agreement with general electric to ce ##rti ##fy the 747 with cf ##6 - 50 series engines to increase the aircraft ' s market potential . [SEP]
[CLS] rolls - royce followed 747 engine production with a launch order from british airways for four aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] the option of rb ##21 ##1 - 52 ##4 ##b engines was announced on june 17 , 1975 . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 200 was the first 747 to provide a choice of powerplant from the three major engine manufacturers . [SEP]
[CLS] a total of 39 ##3 of the 747 - 200 versions had been built when production ended in 1991 . [SEP]
[CLS] of these , 225 were - 200 ##b , 73 were - 200 ##f , 13 were - 200 ##c , 78 were - 200 ##m , and 4 were military . [SEP]
[CLS] iran air retired the last passenger 747 - 200 in may 2016 , 36 years after it was delivered . [SEP]
[CLS] s of july 2018 , eight 747 - 200 ##s remain in service as freighter ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 300 features a 23 ft upper deck than the - 200 . [SEP]
[CLS] the stretched upper deck has two emergency exit doors and is the most visible difference between the - 300 and previous models . [SEP]
[CLS] before being made standard on the 747 - 300 , the stretched upper deck was previously offered as a retro ##fi ##t , and appeared on two japanese 747 - 100 ##sr aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 300 introduced a new straight stairway to the upper deck , instead of a spiral staircase on earlier variants , which creates room above and below for more seats . [SEP]
[CLS] minor aerodynamic changes allowed the - 300 ' s cruise speed to reach mach 0 . 85 compared with mach 0 . 84 on the - 200 and - 100 models , while retaining the same takeoff weight . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 300 could be equipped with the same pratt & whitney and rolls - royce powerplant ##s as on the - 200 , as well as updated general electric cf ##6 - 80 ##c ##2 ##b ##1 engines . [SEP]
[CLS] swiss ##air placed the first order for the 747 - 300 on june 11 , 1980 . [SEP]
[CLS] the variant revived the 747 - 300 designation , which had been previously used on a design study that did not reach production . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 300 first flew on october 5 , 1982 , and the type ' s first delivery went to swiss ##air on march 23 , 1983 . [SEP]
[CLS] besides the passenger model , two other versions ( - 300 ##m , - 300 ##sr ) were produced . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 300 ##m features cargo capacity on the rear portion of the main deck , similar to the - 200 ##m , but with the stretched upper deck it can carry more passengers . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 300 ##sr , a short range , high - capacity domestic model , was produced for japanese markets with a maximum seating for 58 ##4 . [SEP]
[CLS] no production freighter version of the 747 - 300 was built , but boeing began modifications of used passenger - 300 models into freighter ##s in 2000 . [SEP]
[CLS] a total of 81 747 - 300 series aircraft were delivered , 56 for passenger use , 21 - 300 ##m and 4 - 300 ##sr versions . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1985 , just two years after the - 300 entered service , the type was superseded by the announcement of the more advanced 747 - 400 . [SEP]
[CLS] the last 747 - 300 was delivered in september 1990 to sa ##ben ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] while some - 300 customers continued operating the type , several large carriers replaced their 747 - 300 ##s with 747 - 400 ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] air france , air india , pakistan international airlines , and q ##anta ##s were some of the last major carriers to operate the 747 - 300 . [SEP]
[CLS] on december 29 , 2008 , q ##anta ##s flew its last scheduled 747 - 300 service , operating from melbourne to los angeles via auckland . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 2015 , pakistan international airlines retired their final 747 - 300 after 30 years of service . [SEP]
[CLS] s of july 2018 , only five 747 - 300 ##s remain in commercial service , with max air ( 3 ) , maha ##n air ( 1 ) and trans ##avia ##ex ##port airlines ( 1 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 400 is an improved model with increased range . [SEP]
[CLS] it has wing ##tip extensions of 6 ft and wing ##lets of 6 ft , which improve the type ' s fuel efficiency by four percent compared to previous 747 versions . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 400 introduced a new glass cockpit designed for a flight crew of two instead of three , with a reduction in the number of dial ##s , gauge ##s and knob ##s from 97 ##1 to 365 through the use of electronics . [SEP]
[CLS] the type also features tail fuel tanks , revised engines , and a new interior . [SEP]
[CLS] the longer range has been used by some airlines to bypass traditional fuel stops , such as anchorage . [SEP]
[CLS] powerplant ##s include the pratt & whitney p ##w ##40 ##6 ##2 , general electric cf ##6 - 80 ##c ##2 , and rolls - royce rb ##21 ##1 - 52 ##4 . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result of the boeing 76 ##7 development overlapping with the 747 - 400 ' s development , both aircraft can use the same three powerplant ##s and are even interchange ##able between the two aircraft models . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 400 was offered in passenger ( - 400 ) , freighter ( - 400 ##f ) , comb ##i ( - 400 ##m ) , domestic ( - 400 ##d ) , extended range passenger ( - 400 ##er ) , and extended range freighter ( - 400 ##er ##f ) versions . [SEP]
[CLS] passenger versions retain the same upper deck as the - 300 , while the freighter version does not have an extended upper deck . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 400 ##d was built for short - range operations with maximum seating for 62 ##4 . [SEP]
[CLS] wing ##lets were not included , but they can be retro ##fi ##tted . [SEP]
[CLS] cruising speed is up to mach 0 . 85 ##5 on different versions of the 747 - 400 . [SEP]
[CLS] the passenger version first entered service in february 1989 with launch customer northwest airlines on the minneapolis to phoenix route . [SEP]

[CLS] in january 2004 , boeing and cat ##hay pacific launched the boeing 747 - 400 special freighter program , later referred to as the boeing converted freighter ( bc ##f ) , to modify passenger 747 - 400 ##s for cargo use . [SEP]
[CLS] the first 747 - 400 ##bc ##f was red ##eli ##vered in december 2005 . [SEP]
[CLS] in march 2007 , boeing announced that it had no plans to produce further passenger versions of the - 400 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , orders for 36 - 400 ##f and - 400 ##er ##f freighter ##s were already in place at the time of the announcement . [SEP]
[CLS] the last passenger version of the 747 - 400 was delivered in april 2005 to china airlines . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the last built 747 - 400 ##s were delivered with dream ##liner livery along with the modern signature interior from the boeing 77 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] a total of 69 ##4 of the 747 - 400 series aircraft were delivered . [SEP]
[CLS] at various times , the largest 747 - 400 operator has included singapore airlines , japan airlines , and british airways with 36 as of july 2018 . [SEP]
[CLS] s of july 2018 , 339 747 - 400 ##s remain in service . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 400 dream ##lift ##er ( originally called the 747 large cargo freighter or lc ##f ) is a boeing - designed modification of existing 747 - 400 ##s to a larger configuration to ferry 78 ##7 dream ##liner sub - assemblies . [SEP]
[CLS] evergreen aviation technologies corporation of taiwan was contracted to complete modifications of 747 - 400 ##s into dream ##lift ##ers in tao ##yuan . [SEP]
[CLS] the aircraft flew for the first time on september 9 , 2006 in a test flight . [SEP]
[CLS] modification of four aircraft was completed by february 2010 . [SEP]
[CLS] the dream ##lift ##ers have been placed into service transporting sub - assemblies for the 78 ##7 program to the boeing plant in everett , washington , for final assembly . [SEP]
[CLS] the aircraft is certified to carry only essential crew and not passengers . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing announced a new 747 variant , the 747 - 8 , on november 14 , 2005 . [SEP]
[CLS] referred to as the 747 advanced prior to its launch , the 747 - 8 uses the same engine and cockpit technology as the 78 ##7 , hence the use of the " 8 " . [SEP]
[CLS] the variant is designed to be quieter , more economical , and more environmentally friendly . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 8 ' s fuselage is length ##ened from 232 to 251 feet ( 70 . 8 to 76 . 4 m ) , marking the first stretch variant of the aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] power is supplied by general electric gen ##x - 2 ##b ##6 ##7 engines . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 8 freighter , or 747 - 8 ##f , is derived from the 747 - 400 ##er ##f . [SEP]
[CLS] the variant has 16 % more payload capacity than its predecessor , allowing it to carry seven more standard air cargo containers , with a maximum payload capacity of 154 tons ( 140 tonnes ) of cargo . [SEP]
[CLS] as on previous 747 freighter ##s , the 747 - 8 ##f features an overhead nose - door and a side - door on the main deck plus a side - door on the lower deck ( " belly " ) to aid loading and un ##loading . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 8 ##f made its maiden flight on february 8 , 2010 . [SEP]
[CLS] the variant received its amended type certificate jointly from the faa and the european aviation safety agency ( ea ##sa ) on august 19 , 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 8 ##f was first delivered to cargo ##lux on october 12 , 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] the passenger version , named 747 - 8 intercontinental or 747 - 8 ##i , is designed to carry up to 46 ##7 passengers in a 3 - class configuration and fly more than 800 ##0 nmi at mach 0 . 85 ##5 . [SEP]
[CLS] as a derivative of the already common 747 - 400 , the 747 - 8 has the economic benefit of similar training and interchange ##able parts . [SEP]
[CLS] the type ' s first test flight occurred on march 20 , 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 8 has surpassed the airbus a ##34 ##0 - 600 as the world ' s longest airline ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] the first - 8 ##i was delivered in may 2012 to lu ##ft ##han ##sa . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 8 has received 154 total orders , including 107 for the - 8 ##f and 47 for the - 8 ##i as of may 2019 . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing has studied a number of 747 variants that have not gone beyond the concept stage . [SEP]
[CLS] during the late 1960s and early 1970s , boeing studied the development of a shorter 747 with three engines , to compete with the smaller lockheed l - 101 ##1 tri ##star and mcdonnell douglas dc - 10 . [SEP]
[CLS] the center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an s - duct intake similar to the l - 101 ##1 ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] overall , the 747 tri ##jet would have had more payload , range , and passenger capacity than both of them . [SEP]
[CLS] however , engineering studies showed that a major redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot re ##train ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four - engine 747 , resulting in the 747 ##sp . [SEP]
[CLS] in january 1986 , boeing outlined preliminary studies to build a larger , ultra - long haul version named the 747 - 500 , which would enter service in the mid - to late - 1990s . [SEP]
[CLS] the derivative would use more efficient und ##uc ##ted fan ( ud ##f ) engines ( prop ##fan ##s ) made by general electric , be stretched ( including the upper deck section ) to a capacity of 500 seats , have a new wing to reduce drag , cruise at a faster speed to reduce flight times , and have a range of at least 1000 ##0 mi , which would allow airlines to fly nonstop between london , england and sydney , australia . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 500 was never built . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing announced the 747 as ##b ( " advanced short body " ) in 1986 as a response to the airbus a ##34 ##0 and the mcdonnell douglas md - 11 . [SEP]
[CLS] this aircraft design would have combined the advanced technology used on the 747 - 400 with the fore ##sho ##rte ##ned 747 ##sp fuselage . [SEP]
[CLS] the aircraft was to carry 295 passengers a range of 800 ##0 nmi . [SEP]
[CLS] however , airlines were not interested in the project and it was canceled in 1988 in favor of the 77 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing announced the 747 - 500 ##x and - 600 ##x at the 1996 far ##nb ##orough airs ##how . [SEP]
[CLS] the proposed models would have combined the 747 ' s fuselage with a new 251 ft ( 77 m ) span wing derived from the 77 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] other changes included adding more powerful engines and increasing the number of tires from two to four on the nose landing gear and from 16 to 20 on the main landing gear . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 500 ##x concept featured an increased fuselage length of 18 ft ( 5 . 5 m ) to 250 ft ( 76 . 2 m ) long , and the aircraft was to carry 46 ##2 passengers over a range up to 8 , 700 nautical miles ( 10 , 000 mi , 16 , 100 km ) , with a gross weight of over 1 . 0 mlb ( 450 tonnes ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 600 ##x concept featured a greater stretch to 279 ft ( 85 m ) with seating for 54 ##8 passengers , a range of up to 7 , 700 nmi ( 8 , 900 mi , 14 , 300 km ) , and a gross weight of 1 . 2 mlb ( 540 tonnes ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a third study concept , the 747 - 700 ##x , would have combined the wing of the 747 - 600 ##x with a widened fuselage , allowing it to carry 650 passengers over the same range as a 747 - 400 . [SEP]
[CLS] the cost of the changes from previous 747 models , in particular the new wing for the 747 - 500 ##x and - 600 ##x , was estimated to be more than us $ 5 billion . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing was not able to attract enough interest to launch the aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] as airbus progressed with its a ##3 ##xx study , boeing offered a 747 derivative as an alternative in 2000 ; a more modest proposal than the previous - 500 ##x and - 600 ##x that retained the 747 ' s overall wing design and add a segment at the root , increasing the span to 229 ft . [SEP]
[CLS] power would have been supplied by either the engine alliance gp ##7 ##17 ##2 or the rolls - royce trent 600 , which were also proposed for the 76 ##7 - 400 ##er ##x . [SEP]
[CLS] a new flight deck based on the 77 ##7 ' s would be used . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 ##x aircraft was to carry 430 passengers over ranges of up to 8 , 700 nmi ( 10 , 000 mi , 16 , 100 km ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 ##x stretch would be extended to 263 ft long , allowing it to carry 500 passengers over ranges of up to 7 , 800 nmi ( 9 , 000 mi , 14 , 500 km ) . [SEP]
[CLS] both would feature an interior based on the 77 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] freighter versions of the 747 ##x and 747 ##x stretch were also studied . [SEP]
[CLS] like its predecessor , the 747 ##x family was unable to garner enough interest to justify production , and it was she ##lved along with the 76 ##7 - 400 ##er ##x in march 2001 , when boeing announced the sonic cruiser concept . [SEP]
[CLS] though the 747 ##x design was less costly than the 747 - 500 ##x and - 600 ##x , it was criticized for not offering a sufficient advance from the existing 747 - 400 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 ##x did not make it beyond the drawing board , but the 747 - 400 ##x being developed concurrently moved into production to become the 747 - 400 ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] after the end of the 747 ##x program , boeing continued to study improvements that could be made to the 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 400 ##x ##q ##lr ( quiet long range ) was meant to have an increased range of 7 , 980 nmi ( 9 , 200 mi , 14 , 800 km ) , with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise . [SEP]
[CLS] improvements studied included raked wing ##tip ##s similar to those used on the 76 ##7 - 400 ##er and a saw ##tooth engine na ##cel ##le for noise reduction . [SEP]
[CLS] although the 747 - 400 ##x ##q ##lr did not move to production , many of its features were used for the 747 advanced , which has now been launched as the 747 - 8 . [SEP]
[CLS] s of july 2018 , 46 ##2 boeing 747 ##s are in airline service , with british airways being the largest operator with 36 747 - 400 ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the last us passenger boeing 747 was retired from delta air lines in december 2017 , after it flew for every american major carrier since its 1970 introduction . [SEP]
[CLS] delta flew three of its last four aircraft on a farewell tour , from seattle to atlanta on december 19 then to los angeles and minneapolis / st paul on december 20 . [SEP]
[CLS] as the iata forecast an increase in air freight from 4 % to 5 % in 2018 fuel ##led by booming trade for time - sensitive goods , from smartphone ##s to fresh flowers , demand for freighter ##s is strong while passenger 747 ##s are phased out . [SEP]
[CLS] of the 1 , 54 ##4 produced , 89 ##0 are retired ; as of 2018 , a small subset of those which were intended to be parted - out get $ 3 million d - checks before flying again . [SEP]
[CLS] young - 400 ##s are sold for 320 million yuan ( $ 50 million ) and boeing stopped converting freighter ##s , which used to cost nearly $ 30 million . [SEP]
[CLS] this comeback helped the air ##frame ##r financing arm boeing capital to shrink its exposure to the 747 - 8 from $ 1 . 07 billion in 2017 to $ 48 ##1 million . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 has been involved in 146 aviation accidents and incidents , including 61 accidents and hull losses which resulted in 37 ##22 fatalities . [SEP]
[CLS] the last crash was turkish airlines flight 64 ##9 ##1 in january 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] there were also 24 deaths in 32 aircraft hi ##jack ##ings , such as pan am flight 73 where a boeing 747 - 121 was hi ##jack ##ed by four terrorists and resulted in 20 deaths . [SEP]
[CLS] few crashes have been attributed to design flaws of the 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] the ten ##eri ##fe airport disaster resulted from pilot error and communications failure , while the japan airlines flight 123 and china airlines flight 61 ##1 crashes stemmed from improper aircraft repair . [SEP]
[CLS] united airlines flight 81 ##1 , which suffered an explosive deco ##mp ##ress ##ion mid - flight on february 24 , 1989 , led the national transportation safety board ( nt ##sb ) to issue a recommendation that the boeing 747 - 100 and 747 - 200 cargo doors similar to those on the flight 81 ##1 aircraft be modified to those featured on the boeing 747 - 400 . [SEP]
[CLS] korean air lines flight 00 ##7 was shot down by a soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 after it had stray ##ed into soviet territory , causing u . s . president ronald reagan to author ##ize the then - strictly military global positioning system ( gps ) for civilian use . [SEP]
[CLS] accidents due to design def ##iciencies included t ##wa flight 800 , where a 747 - 100 exploded in mid - air on july 17 , 1996 , probably due to spark ##ing electricity wires inside the fuel tank ; this finding led the faa to propose a rule requiring installation of an in ##ert ##ing system in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft that was adopted in july 2008 , after years of research into solutions . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time , the new safety system was expected to cost us $ 100 , 000 to $ 450 , 000 per aircraft and weigh approximately 200 lb . [SEP]
[CLS] el al flight 1862 crashed after the fuse pins for an engine broke off shortly after take - off due to metal fatigue . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of dropping away from the wing , the engine knocked off the adjacent engine and damaged the wing . [SEP]
[CLS] as increasing numbers of " classic " 747 - 100 and 747 - 200 series aircraft have been retired , some have found their way into museums or other uses . [SEP]
[CLS] in recent years , some older 747 - 300 ##s and 747 - 400 ##s have also found their way into museums as well . [SEP]
[CLS] upon its retirement from service , the 747 number two in the production line was dismantled and shipped to hop ##ye ##ong , nam ##yang ##ju , g ##ye ##ong ##gi - do , south korea where it was re - assembled , rep ##aint ##ed in a livery similar to that of air force one and converted into a restaurant . [SEP]
[CLS] originally flown commercially by pan am as n ##7 ##47 ##pa , " clip ##per juan t . trip ##pe " , and repaired for service following a tails ##tri ##ke , it stayed with the airline until its bankruptcy . [SEP]
[CLS] the restaurant closed by 2009 , and the aircraft was scrapped in 2010 . [SEP]
[CLS] a former british airways 747 - 200 ##b , g - b ##d ##x ##j , is parked at the dun ##sf ##old aerodrome in surrey , england and has been used as a movie set for productions such as the 2006 james bond film , " casino royale " . [SEP]
[CLS] the plane also appears frequently in the bbc television series " top gear " , which is filmed at dun ##sf ##old . [SEP]
[CLS] the " ju ##mbo ##hos ##tel " , using a converted 747 - 200 formerly registered as 9 ##v - sq ##e , opened at ar ##landa airport , stockholm in january 2009 . [SEP]
[CLS] the wings of a 747 have been recycled as roofs of a house in malibu , california . [SEP]
[CLS] following its debut , the 747 rapidly achieved iconic status , appearing in numerous film productions such as " airport 1975 " and " airport ' 77 " disaster films , " air force one " , " die hard 2 " , and " executive decision " . [SEP]
[CLS] appearing in over 300 film productions the 747 is one of the most widely depicted civilian aircraft and is considered by many as one of the most iconic in film history . [SEP]
[CLS] the aircraft entered the cultural lexi ##con as the original " ju ##mbo jet " , a term coined by the aviation media to describe its size , and was also nicknamed " queen of the skies " . [SEP]
