the boeing 747 is a jet airliner .
it was the first wide-body aircraft ever made .
its distinctive hump upper deck along the front part of the plane makes it one of the most recognizable aircraft .
the 747 was originally planned to have 150 percent greater capacity than the boeing 707 .
the 747 held the record for 37 years .
the quadjet 747 uses both a deck and a freighter version .
it was designed to allow the 747 to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and putting a cargo door .
boeing thought supersonic airliners would be too big to make the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete .
the 747 was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold .
by june 2019,1 , 554 aircraft had been made .
as of 2017,60 of the jets have been lost in accidents in which a total of people died .
the 747-400 is the most common variant in the world .
the 747-400 can carry 416 passengers in a typical three-class layout , 524 passengers in a typical two-class layout , or 660 passengers in a high-density one-class configuration .
the newest version of the 747-8 is in production and received certification in 2011 .
the 747-8f version was delivered in 2011 .
in 1963 , the united states air force began to look for a very big plane to transport transport planes .
however , the c-141 starlifter was being introduced , officials believed that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed .
these studies led to initial requirements for the cx-heavy logistics system darrell cx-hlshausen in march 1964 for an aircraft with a load capacity of 180000 lb and a speed of mach 0.75 mph ; and an unrefueled range of 115,000 nmi with a payload of 115,000 lb .
the cargo bay had to be 17 ft wide and 13.5 ft long .
the desire to keep the number of engines needed new engines with greatly increased power and better fuel economy .
in may 1964 , boeing , douglas , general dynamics , lockheed , and martin marietta designed the engines .
the new plane was designed by boeing , douglas and lockheed .
the airframe proposals shared a number of features .
as the cx-hls needed to be loaded from the front , a door had to be included where the cockpit was .
all of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area ; douglas had a small " pod " just forward and above the wing , lockheed used a long " spine " running the length of the plane with the wing spar passing through it , while boeing blended the two , with a longer pod that ran from just behind the nose to just behind the nose .
in 1965 , lockheed 's plane and general electric 's engines were made for the c-5 galaxy .
the nose door and raised cockpit concepts would be carried over to the design of the 747 .
the 747 was thought of as the 747 was made bigger in the 1960s .
the boeing 707 and douglas dc-8 had made many of the planes to travel long distances .
even before it lost the cx-hls contract , boeing was asked by juan trippe , president of pan ammonium pan amorough to build a plane more than twice the size of the 707 .
during this time , airport congestion became worse by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft .
in 1965 , joe sutter was transferred from boeing 's 737 development team to manage the design studies for the new airliner .
sutter began a design study with pan am and other airlines .
at the time , it was thought that supersonic aircraft would replace the 747 .
boeing responded by designing the 747 so that it could easily be made easily to carry freight and remain in production even if sales of the passenger version declined .
in the freighter role , the clear need was to support the containerized shipping methodologies that were being widely introduced at about the same time .
standard shipping containers are 8 ft square at the front opening a slightly higher .
this meant that it would be possible to support a 2-high stack of containers two or three ranks deep with a fuselage size similar to the earlier cx-hls project .
in april 1966 , pan am bought 25 747-100 planes .
during the ceremonial 747 contract-signing banquet in seattle on boeing 's 50th anniversary , juan trippe said that the 747 would be " . a great weapon for peace , competing with intercontinental missiles for mankind 's destiny " .
pan am was the launch customer , and because it was involved before making a formal order .
the design of the cx-hls boeing model was not used for the 747 .
the first design was a full-length double-deck body with eight-across seating and two aisles on the lower deck and seven-across seating and two aisles on the upper deck .
this idea was scrapped in early 1966 .
the cockpit was put on a shortened upper deck so that a freight-loading door could be included in the nose cone .
in early models it was not clear what to do with the small space in the pod behind the cockpit .
it was called the " anteater " .
one of the main technologies that enabled an aircraft as big as the 747 was the high-bypass turbofan engine .
the engine was thought to be capable of delivering double the power of the earlier turbojets while consuming one â€“ third less fuel .
however , it was making the engines for the c-5 galaxy .
pratt & whitney was also working on the same principle .
the project was designed with a new methodology called fault tree analysis .
the 747 's design was about structural redundancy , redundant hydraulic systems , quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces .
additionally , some of the most advanced high-lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design , to allow it to operate from existing airports .
these included slats running almost the entire length of the wing , as well as complex three-part flaps along the trailing edge of the wing .
the wing 's three-part flaps increase wing area by 21 % and lift by 90 % when deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration .
boeing said that the 747 was going to pan am by the end of 1969 .
the plane was two-thirds of the normal time .
the people who worked on the program were given the nickname " the incredibles " .
designing the aircraft was such a technical and financial challenge that management was said to have " bet the company " when it started the project .
boeing did not have a factory big enough to make the giant airliner .
the company considered locations in about 50 cities , and eventually decided to build the new plant some 30 mi north of seattle on a site adjoining a military base at paine field near everett , washington .
it bought the factory in 1966 .
making the 747 had been a big problem .
boeing president william m . allen asked malcolm t . stamper to look for the building of the everett factory .
to go over the site , more than 4 million cubic kilometers of earth had to be moved .
the 747 's full-scale mock-up was built before the factory roof was finished .
the plant is the largest building ever built .
before the first 747 was put together , parts and systems were being tested .
560 volunteers were taken from a 747-400-bit airplane , using the emergency chutes .
the first evacuation took two and a half minutes .
subsequent test evacuations achieved the 90-second goal but caused more injuries .
instead of using a conventional slide , volunteer passengers escaped by using a harness attached to a reel .
tests also involved taxiing such a large aircraft .
the plane was a mock-up cockpit mounted on the roof of a truck .
while the first 747s were still being built , the device allowed pilots to practice taxi maneuvers from a high upper-deck position .
on september 30,1968 , the first 747 was finished .
it was done on february 9,1969 .
despite a small problem with one of the flaps , the 747 handled well .
the 747 was found to be largely immune to " dutch roll " , a phenomenon that had been a major hazard to the early swept-wing jets .
during the later stages of the flight test program , flutter testing showed that the wings suffered oscillation under certain conditions .
this difficulty was solved by reducing the stiffness of some wing components .
however , a particularly severe high-speed flutter problem was solved only by inserting depleted uranium counterweights as ballast in the outboard engine nacelles of the early 747s .
this measure caused anxiety when these aircraft crashed , for example el al flight 1862 at amsterdam in 1992 with 282 kg of uranium in the tailplaneplaneplanemind horizontal stabilizer sharif .
the test was delayed because of some problems with the jt9d engines .
problems included engine stalls caused by rapid throttle movements and distortion of the turbine casings after a short period of service .
up to 20 aircraft at the everett plant were stranded .
the program was delayed when one of the five test planes suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at renton municipal airport , site of the company 's renton factory .
on december 13,1969 a test plane was being taken to have some parts removed .
the right of the 747 's landing gear was torn off and two of the engines were damaged .
however , boeing took a test plane to the 28th paris air show in mid-1969 .
the 747 received its faa airworthiness certificate in december 1969 .
the cost of making the 747 and building the factory cost a lot of money .
during the final months before delivery of the first plane , the company had to repeatedly request additional funding to complete the project .
had this been refused , boeing 's survival would have been threatened .
the firm 's debt exceeded $ 2 billion , with the $ 1.2 billion owed to the banks setting a record for all companies .
allen said , " it was really too large a project for us . "
boeing had a monopoly in very large planes making for many years .
on january 15,1970 , first lady of the united states pat nixon christened pan am 's first 747 .
instead of champagne , red , white and blue water was sprayed on the plane .
the 747 was first used on january 22,1970 .
finding a substitute delayed the flight by more than six hours to the next day when clipper victor was used .
the 747 was a fairly smooth introduction into service .
there were some problems , but they were quite small and they were fixed quickly .
after pan am bought the 747 , other airlines began to use their 747s .
boeing said that half of the early 747 sales were to airlines .
while the 747 had the lowest potential operating cost per seat , this could only be achieved when the plane was fully loaded ; costs per seat increased rapidly as occupancy declined .
a moderately loaded 747 , one with only 70 percent of its seats occupied , used more than 95 percent of the fuel needed by a 747 .
however , many flag-carriers bought the 747 because it was so good to " even if it made no sense economically " to operate .
during the 1970s and 1980s , there was often over 30 regular 747s at john f . kennedy international airport .
the recession of 1969-1970 was very bad for boeing .
for the year and a half after september 1970 , it only sold two 747s in the world .
after the 1973 oil crisis , several airlines found they did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 .
in 1983 , delta air lines also removed its 747s from service after several years .
delta airlines bought the 747-400 in 2008 .
flights which landed at smaller cities became more common in the 1980s .
many airlines still used the 747 on pacific routes .
in japan , 747s on domestic routes were designed to carry the maximum passenger capacity .
after the initial 747-100 , boeing made the âˆ’ 100b .
this means that the aircraft can carry more fuel and have longer range .
the-200 model was made in 1971 .
cargo , freighter and cargo versions of the âˆ’ 200 were made .
the 747sp ( special performance occurred in 1976 .
the 747-300 was made in 1980 .
the 300 series resulted from boeing studies to increase the seating capacity of the 747 .
the first 747-300 was made in 1983 .
the 747-300 was called the 747-300 type .
the first type of the 300 series was made in the united states .
in 1985 , boeing began to design the 747-400 .
the cockpit had a new glass cockpit , which allowed for a cockpit crew of two instead of three , new engines , and a redesigned interior .
new technologies were incorporated at the request of airlines .
insufficient workers experience and reliance on overtime helped the 747-400 .
the 747-400 was first used in 1989 .
in 1991,1 , 087 passengers were taken to israel to work on a 747 .
the 747 was the heaviest commercial plane in regular service until the first 747-124 was made in 1982 .
the antonov an-225 " mriya " cargo transport , which first appeared in 1988 , remains the world 's largest aircraft .
the scaled composites stratolaunch is the largest aircraft in the world .
the 747-400 has been proposed to be the first 747 ever to use the 747 .
in 1996 , boeing said they would make the 747-500x and-600x .
the new planes would have cost more than us $ 5 billion to design .
in 2000 , boeing said that the 747x and 747x were different to the airbus a3xx .
however , the 747x family was unable to get enough interest to make the 747x .
a year later , boeing began concentrating on the sonic cruiser .
some of the ideas for the 747x were used on the 747-400er , a longer range version of the 747-400 .
after several different types were proposed but later abandoned , some industry observers became skeptical of new plane proposals from boeing .
however , in 2004 , boeing said that it would make the 747 advanced .
the 747 advanced used the same technology from the 787 to modernize the design and its systems .
the 747 was the largest passenger airliner in service until the airbus a380 began to be used in 2007 .
on november 14,2005 , boeing said it was making the 747 advanced as the boeing 747-8 .
the last 747-400s were made in 2009 .
the 747-8 has been made for the freighter version .
its first flight was on february 8,2010 .
cargolux got the first 747-8 in 2011 .
the first boeing 747 was made in june 2014 .
in january 2016 , boeing said it was reducing 747-8 production to six a year beginning in september 2016 .
at the end of 2015 , the company had 20 orders outstanding .
on january 29,2016 , boeing said that it will work on a 747-8 for the next air force one presidential aircraft .
on july 12,2016 , it was announced that it had finalized terms of acquisition with volga-dnepr group for 20 747-8 freighters , valued at $ 7.58 billion at list prices .
four aircraft were delivered in 2012 .
volga-dnepr is the parent of three major russian air-freight carriers â€“ volga-dnepr airlines , airbridge-airlines and atran airlines .
the new 747-8 freighters will replace the 747-400 aircraft and expand the airline 's fleet .
on july 27,2016 , in its quarterly report to the securities and exchange commission , boeing said that the 747 would end due to insufficient demand and market for the aircraft .
with a firm order backlog of 21 aircraft and a production rate of 6 per year , program accounting has been reduced to 1,555 aircraft , and the 747 line could be closed in the third quarter of 2019 .
in october 2016 , ups airlines ordered 14-8fs to add capacity , along with 14 options , which it took in february 2018 bringing the total number of-8fs ordered to 28 .
the backlog then stood at 25 aircraft , though several of these are orders from airlines that no longer meant to take delivery .
the first deliveries are scheduled to 2022 .
the boeing 747 is a big , wide-body airliner with four wing-mounted engines .
its wings have a high sweep angle of 37.5 degrees for a fast , efficient cruise speed of mach 0.84 to 0.88 , depending on the variant .
the sweep also reduces the wingspan , allowing the 747 to use existing hangars .
the seating capacity is over 366 with a 3-4-3 seat arrangement .
the upper deck has a 3-3 seat arrangement in economy class .
the cockpit is raised above the main deck .
this raised cockpit allows front loading of cargo on freight variants .
the upper deck behind the cockpit is a lounge .
the " stretched upper deck " became available as an alternative to the 747-100b version and later as standard beginning on the 747-300 .
the upper deck was made bigger on the 747-8 .
the 747 cockpit roof section also has an escape hatch from which crew can exit during the events of an emergency if they cannot do so through the cabin .
the 747 's maximum takeoff weight ranges from 735,000 poundsanor 333,400 kg .
its range has increased from 5,300 nautical miles across , from 8,000 km to 8,800 km km km km .
the 747 has redundant structures along with four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears each with four wheels .
the main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others are not working properly .
the 747 also has split control surfaces .
for spare engines , the 747 can have a fifth-pod engine under the plane 's port wing .
this fifth engine mount point is also used by virgin orbit 's launcherone program .
the 747-400 carries the orbital-class rocket to fly altitude .
the 747-100 was the 747-version of the 747-100 .
the 747-200 was made in 1968 .
the 747-300 was made in 1980 .
the newest version of the 747-8 was announced in 2005 .
several versions of each variant have been made .
the international civil aviation organization runs its predecessor using a shortened code formed by combining the model number and the variant designatorials e . g . " b741 " for all-100 models ashore .
the first 747-100s had six windows .
later , airlines began to use the upper deck for premium passengers instead of using lounge space .
some early-100s were retrofitted with the new configuration .
the âˆ’ 100 had pratt & whitney jt9d-3a engines .
no freighter version of this model was made , but many 747-100s were changed into freighters .
a total of 168 747-100s were made .
responding to requests from japanese airlines for a high capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities , boeing made the 747sr as a short range version of the 747-100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability .
with increased economy class seating , up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models .
the 747sr had an economic design for 52,000 flights .
the first 747sr model , the-100sr , had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the extra stress accumulated from a greater number of takeoffs and landings .
extra support was built into the wings , fuselage , and landing gear .
the first flight took place on august 31,1973 .
the first version was delivered on the same day .
the first-100sr entered service with jal on october 7,1973 .
seven-100srs were built between 1973 and 1975 .
after the âˆ’ 100sr , boeing made the-100bsr , a 747sr version with increased takeoff weight .
a similar standard-100b model was introduced in 1979 .
it first flew on november 3,1978 .
twenty-100bsr were made for jal and ana .
the-100bsr had a 600,000 lbow .
ana operated this variant on domestic japanese routes with 455 or 456 seats until retiring its last aircraft in march 2006 .
in 1986 , two-100bsr sud models , featuring the stretched upper deck aarhus sudeley of the-300 , were produced for jal .
the first flight was on march 24,1986 .
it has 563 seats on domestic routes .
while only two-100bsr suds were produced , in theory , standard-100bs can be changed to the sud certification .
the 747sr was made of seven-100srs , twenty-100bsrs , and two-100bsr suds .
the 747-100b model was made from the âˆ’ 100sr .
the type had an increased fuel capacity of 48070 usgal .
the first-100b order was announced on june 1,1978 .
it was delivered the next day .
one was for iran air and eight for saudi arabian airlines .
the-100b was made with pratt & whitney jt9d-7a , general electric cf6-50 , or rolls-royce rb211-524 engines .
however , only rb211-524 jenks saudiact and jt9d-7a ( iran airrned engines were ordered .
the last 747-100b was made by iran air in 2014 .
the development of the 747sp started with a joint request between pan american world airways and iran air .
the tehran â€“ new york route was the longest non-stop commercial flight in the world .
the 747sp is a shorter version of the 747-100 .
the fuselage parts were removed from the front and the wing was changed to fit the mating parts .
the sp 's flaps used a simplified single-slotted configuration .
the 747sp had a tapering of the back part of the body , a double-hinged rudder , and longer vertical and horizontal stabilizers .
pratt & whitney jt9d-7 foley a / f / fwhedral or rolls-royce rb211-524 engines .
the 747sp was granted a supplemental certificate on february 4,1976 .
the aircraft was chosen by airlines who wanted to serve major airports with short runways .
the 747sp was delivered on august 30,1982 .
in 1987 , boeing re-opened the 747sp production line after five years to build one last 747sp for an order by the united arab emirates government .
one 747sp was used for the nasa / german aerospace center sofia experiment .
iran air is the last civil operator of the type .
the 747-100 had pratt & whitney jt9d-3a engines .
the demand for longer range aircraft with increased payload quickly led to the improved-200 , which featured more powerful engines , increased mtow , and greater range than the âˆ’ 100 .
a few early-200s kept the three-window configuration of the-100 on the upper deck , but most were built with a ten-window configuration on each side .
the 747-200 was made in passenger proceedings .
the 747-200b was the basic version of the 747-200 .
in its first three years of making , the-200 was able to have pratt & whitney jt9d-7 engines illustrating the only engine available elsewhere .
range with a full passenger load started at over 5000 nmi and increased to 6000 nmi with later engines .
most-200bs had an upper deck , allowing for up to 16 seats .
the freighter model , the 747-200f , could be fitted with or without a side cargo door .
it was launched in 1972 .
the convertible version , the 747-200c , could be changed between a passenger and a freighter .
the-200c could also be fitted with an optional side cargo door on the main deck .
the 747-200m model could carry freight in the rear section of the main deck .
a removable partition on the main deck separated the cargo area at the rear from the passengers at the front .
the-200m could carry up to 238 passengers .
the 747-200 was also known as the 747-200 combi .
as on the-100 , a stretched upper deck twain was later offered .
a total of 10 747-200s were used by klm .
union de transports aeriensttered utarwood also had two aircraft changed .
on august 1,1972 , boeing said that it had reached an agreement with general electric to make the 747 with cf6-50 .
the 747 was made from british airways for four aircraft .
the option of rb211-524b engines was announced on june 17,1975 .
the âˆ’ 200 was the first 747 to be used by airlines .
the 747-200 version had been made when boeing stopped making 747-200s in 1991 .
of these , 225 were-200b , 73 were-200f , 13-200c , 78-200m , and 4 were military .
iran air stopped the 747-200 in may 2016 .
as of july 2018 , eight 747-200s remain in service as freighters .
the 747-300 is a 23 ft upper deck version of the 747-200 .
it is the most visible difference between the-300 and previous models .
before being made into the 747-300 , the stretched upper deck was a retrofit , and appeared on two japanese 747-100sr aircraft .
the 747-300 introduced a new straight stairway to the upper deck .
this allowed the-300 's cruise speed to reach mach 0.85 compared with mach 0.84 on the-200 and-100 models , while retaining the same takeoff weight .
the-300 could have the same pratt & whitney and rolls-royce engines as on the-200 .
the first 747-300 was made in june 1980 .
the 747-300 was used for a design study .
the 747-300 first flew on october 5,1982 .
besides the passenger model , two other versionspotible-300m ,-300sr ) were produced .
the 747-300m has cargo capacity on the rear part of the main deck , similar to the 747-200m .
the 747-300sr was a short range , high-capacity domestic model .
however , boeing began using the 747-300 models into freighters in 2000 .
a total of 81 747-300 series aircraft were delivered , 56 for passenger use , 21-300m and 4-300sr versions .
in 1985 , just two years after the 747 first arrived , the 747 was made .
the last 747-300 was made in 1990 .
while some-300 customers continued using the type , some airlines replaced their 747-300s with 747-400s .
air france , air india , pakistan international airlines , and qantas were some of the last major airlines to use the 747-300 .
qantas flew its last 747-300 service , which was scheduled to operate from melbourne to los angeles via auckland .
in july 2015 , pakistan international airlines stopped using their 747-300 .
as of july 2018 , only five 747-300s remain in commercial service .
the 747-400 is a new type of 747 .
it has wingtip extensions of 6 ft and winglets of 6 ft .
the 747-400 introduced a new glass cockpit .
it also has tail fuel tanks , revised engines , and a new interior .
the longer range has been used by some airlines to bypass traditional fuel stops , such as anchorage .
it also has the rolls-royce rb211-524 .
both aircraft can use the same three engines .
the-400 was offered in passenger carriers-400 ; freighter rq-400f breuning , combichment-400mometers , domesticated-400erryl-400erware , and extended range passengerciful-400er versions .
the freighter version has the same upper deck as the-300 .
the 747-400d has a maximum seating capacity for 624 .
winglets were not included , but they can be made retrofitted .
cruising speed is up to mach 0.855 on different types of the 747-400 .
the first passenger version of the plane was in february 1989 .
the freighter version was made in november 1993 with cargolux .
the 747-400erf entered service with air france in october 2002 .
in 2004 , boeing and cathay pacific launched the boeing 747-400 special freighter program .
the first 747-400bcf was redelivered in december 2005 .
in march 2007 , boeing said it had no plans to make more planes .
however , orders for 36-400f and-400erf were already in place at the time of the announcement .
the last passenger version of the 747-400 was delivered in april 2005 to china airlines .
some of the last 747-400s were made with dreamliner livery along with the modern signature interior from the boeing 777 .
704 of the 747-400 series were made .
the largest 747-400 operator has included singapore airlines , japan airlines , and british airways with 36 as of july 2018 .
as of july 2018,339 747-400s remain in service .
the 747-400 dreamlifter engines were designed to be called the 747-400s .
evergreen aviation technologies corporation of taiwan was contracted to complete changes of 747-400s into dreamlifters in taoyuan .
the first flight of the aeroplane was on september 9,2006 .
modification of four aircraft was completed in february 2010 .
the dreamlifters have been placed into service taking sub-assemblies for the 787 program to the boeing plant in everett , washington , for final assembly .
the aircraft is certified to carry only essential crew and not passengers .
on november 14,2005 , boeing said they would make a new 747 version .
the 747-8 is the most used type of 747 , so the 747-8 is used .
it is designed to be quieter , more economical , and more environmentally friendly .
the 747-8 's body is 232 to 251 feet wide .
power is supplied by general electric genx-2b67 engines .
the 747-8 freighter is a type of 747-400er .
it can carry 7 more standard air cargo containers .
the 747-8f also has a side-door on the main deck .
the 747-8f made its first flight on february 8,2010 .
it received its amended type certificate .
cargolux got the first-8f on october 12,2011 .
the 747-8 intercontinental or 747-8i is designed to carry up to 467 passengers in a 3-class configuration and fly more than 8000 nmi at mach 0.855 .
the 747-8 is a version of the 747-400 .
the first flight of the 747 was on march 20,2011 .
the 747-8 has been the world 's longest airliner .
it was delivered in may 2012 .
the 747-8 has received 154 total orders , including 107 for the-8f and 47 for the-8i .
boeing has studied some 747 types .
during the late 1960s and early 1970s , boeing studied the making of a shorter 747 with three engines .
the engine would have been fitted in the tail with an s-duct intake similar to the l-1011 's .
the 747 trijet would carry more passengers than the 747 .
however , engineering studies showed that a major redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary .
maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining .
boeing decided to use the 747sp to make a 747 .
in january 1986 , boeing wanted to make a bigger version of the 747-500 .
the version would use more efficient unducted fanciful fanciful engines ashore to make the upper deck .
the 747-500 was never made .
in 1986 , boeing said the 747 had made a bigger body .
this plane would have combined the advanced technology used on the 747-400 with the foreshortened 747sp fuselage .
the plane was to carry 295 passengers a range of 8000 nmi .
however , airlines were not interested in the project and it was canceled in 1988 in favor of the 777 .
at the 1996 farnborough airshow , boeing said the 747-500x and-600x at the farnborough airshow .
the proposed models would have combined the 747 's fuselage with a new 251 ftference 77 m wingspan span wing .
other changes included adding more powerful engines and increasing the number of tires from two to four on the nose landing gear and from 16 to 20 on the main landing gear .
the 747-500x concept featured an increased fuselage length of 18 ftference of 5.5 m diameter to 250 ftference 76.2 m depth depth , and the plane was to carry 462 passengers over a range up to 8,700 nautical miles ; with a gross weight of over 1,500 km , with a gross weight of over 1.0 mlb manfred manfred manfred manfred manfred .
the 747-600x concept had a greater stretch to 279 ft diameter -lrb- 85 m -rrb- size size .
this would have combined the wing of the 747-600x with a widened fuselage , allowing it to carry 650 passengers over the same range as a 747-400 .
the new wing for the 747-500x was said to be more than $ 5 billion .
boeing was not able to get enough interest to launch the plane .
as airbus progressed with its a3xx study , boeing offered a 747 version as an alternative in 2000 .
power would have been supplied by either the engine alliance gp7172 or the rolls-royce trent 600 .
a new flight deck , the 777 's , would be used .
the 747x aircraft was to carry 430 passengers .
the 747x stretch would be extended to 263 ft long .
both would feature an interior based on the 777 .
freighter versions of the 747x and 747x stretch were also studied .
like the 747x family , the 747x family was unable to get enough interest to make the 747x .
however , it was criticized for not having enough money to buy the 747-400 .
the 747x did not make it beyond the drawing board .
after the end of the 747x program , boeing continued to study improvements that could be made to the 747 .
the 747-400xqlrlrlrlrlrlr was meant to have an increased range of 7,980 nmi ; 9,200 mi , 14,800 km .
improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400er and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction .
however , many of its features were used for the 747 advanced , which has now been launched as the 747-8 .
the airline is now the largest operator with 36 747-400s .
the last u . s . passenger boeing 747 was retired from delta air lines in december 2017 , after it flew for every american major carrier since 1970 .
delta flew three of its last four aircraft on a farewell tour , from seattle to atlanta on december 19 , then to los angeles and minneapolis on december 20 .
the iata forecast forecast forecasts an increase in air freight from 4 % to 5 % in 2018 .
of the 1,544 produced , 890 are retired .
young-400s are sold for 320 million yuan corporations .
this helped the airframer financing arm boeing capital to shrink its exposure to the 747-8 from $ 1.07 billion in 2017 to $ 481 million .
the 747 has been involved in 146 aviation accidents and incidents .
the last crash was in january 2017 .
there were also 24 deaths in 32 aircraft hijackings , such as pan am flight 73 .
some crashes have been said to be the reason the 747 was designed .
the japan airlines flight 123 and china airlines flight 611 crashes caused from wrong aircraft repair .
united airlines flight 811 was a mistake that the boeing 747-100 and 747-200 cargo doors were designed .
the flight was shot down by a soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 .
this finding led the faa to a rule requiring installation of an inerting system in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft that was adopted in july 2008 .
at the time , the new safety system was expected to cost us $ 100,000 to $ 450,000 per aircraft and weigh about 200 lb .
el al flight 1862 crashed after the fuse pins for an engine broke off shortly after take-off due to metal fatigue .
instead of dropping away from the wing , the engine knocked off the adjacent engine and damaged the wing .
some have found their way into museums or other uses .
some older 747-300s and 747-400s have also made their way into museums .
when it was retired , the 747 number two was taken apart and shipped to hopyeonggi-do , south korea .
it was fixed for service after a tailstrike .
the restaurant closed by 2009 .
a former british airways 747-200b , g-bdxj , is parked at the dunsfold aerodrome in surrey , england .
the plane also appears in the bbc television series " top gear " , which is filmed at dunsfold .
the jumbohostel was a 747-200 which was registered as 9v-sqe .
the wings of a 747 have been used as roofs of a house in malibu , california .
after its first movie , the 747 rapidly achieved iconic status , appearing in numerous movie productions such as " airport 1975 " and " airport ' 77 " disaster movies , " air force one " , " die hard 2 " , and " executive decision " .
it is seen in over 300 movie productions .
the plane was nicknamed " queen of the skies " .
aircraft of similar role , configuration and eramorphosis are similar to each other .
