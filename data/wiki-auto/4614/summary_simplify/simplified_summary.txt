its distinctive hump upper deck along the front part of the plane makes it one of the most recognizable aircraft .
the 747 was originally planned to have 150 percent greater capacity than the boeing 707 .
the quadjet 747 uses both a deck and a freighter version .
it was designed to allow the 747 to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and putting a cargo door .
boeing thought supersonic airliners would be too big to make the 747 and other subsonic airliners obsolete .
the newest version of the 747-8 is in production and received certification in 2011 .
however , the c-141 starlifter was being introduced , officials believed that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed .
in may 1964 , boeing , douglas , general dynamics , lockheed , and martin marietta designed the engines .
the new plane was designed by boeing , douglas and lockheed .
all of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area ; douglas had a small " pod " just forward and above the wing , lockheed used a long " spine " running the length of the plane with the wing spar passing through it , while boeing blended the two , with a longer pod that ran from just behind the nose to just behind the nose .
in 1965 , lockheed 's plane and general electric 's engines were made for the c-5 galaxy .
the nose door and raised cockpit concepts would be carried over to the design of the 747 .
the 747 was thought of as the 747 was made bigger in the 1960s .
the boeing 707 and douglas dc-8 had made many of the planes to travel long distances .
even before it lost the cx-hls contract , boeing was asked by juan trippe , president of pan ammonium pan amorough to build a plane more than twice the size of the 707 .
during this time , airport congestion became worse by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft .
in 1965 , joe sutter was transferred from boeing 's 737 development team to manage the design studies for the new airliner .
at the time , it was thought that supersonic aircraft would replace the 747 .
boeing responded by designing the 747 so that it could easily be made easily to carry freight and remain in production even if sales of the passenger version declined .
in the freighter role , the clear need was to support the containerized shipping methodologies that were being widely introduced at about the same time .
this meant that it would be possible to support a 2-high stack of containers two or three ranks deep with a fuselage size similar to the earlier cx-hls project .
during the ceremonial 747 contract-signing banquet in seattle on boeing 's 50th anniversary , juan trippe said that the 747 would be " . a great weapon for peace , competing with intercontinental missiles for mankind 's destiny " .
pan am was the launch customer , and because it was involved before making a formal order .
this idea was scrapped in early 1966 .
the cockpit was put on a shortened upper deck so that a freight-loading door could be included in the nose cone .
it was called the " anteater " .
one of the main technologies that enabled an aircraft as big as the 747 was the high-bypass turbofan engine .
however , it was making the engines for the c-5 galaxy .
pratt & whitney was also working on the same principle .
the project was designed with a new methodology called fault tree analysis .
additionally , some of the most advanced high-lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design , to allow it to operate from existing airports .
the wing 's three-part flaps increase wing area by 21 % and lift by 90 % when deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration .
boeing did not have a factory big enough to make the giant airliner .
the company considered locations in about 50 cities , and eventually decided to build the new plant some 30 mi north of seattle on a site adjoining a military base at paine field near everett , washington .
boeing president william m . allen asked malcolm t . stamper to look for the building of the everett factory .
the plant is the largest building ever built .
560 volunteers were taken from a 747-400-bit airplane , using the emergency chutes .
the first evacuation took two and a half minutes .
instead of using a conventional slide , volunteer passengers escaped by using a harness attached to a reel .
while the first 747s were still being built , the device allowed pilots to practice taxi maneuvers from a high upper-deck position .
on september 30,1968 , the first 747 was finished .
it was done on february 9,1969 .
the 747 was found to be largely immune to " dutch roll " , a phenomenon that had been a major hazard to the early swept-wing jets .
during the later stages of the flight test program , flutter testing showed that the wings suffered oscillation under certain conditions .
however , a particularly severe high-speed flutter problem was solved only by inserting depleted uranium counterweights as ballast in the outboard engine nacelles of the early 747s .
this measure caused anxiety when these aircraft crashed , for example el al flight 1862 at amsterdam in 1992 with 282 kg of uranium in the tailplaneplaneplanemind horizontal stabilizer sharif .
problems included engine stalls caused by rapid throttle movements and distortion of the turbine casings after a short period of service .
up to 20 aircraft at the everett plant were stranded .
the program was delayed when one of the five test planes suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at renton municipal airport , site of the company 's renton factory .
on december 13,1969 a test plane was being taken to have some parts removed .
the right of the 747 's landing gear was torn off and two of the engines were damaged .
however , boeing took a test plane to the 28th paris air show in mid-1969 .
the cost of making the 747 and building the factory cost a lot of money .
during the final months before delivery of the first plane , the company had to repeatedly request additional funding to complete the project .
the firm 's debt exceeded $ 2 billion , with the $ 1.2 billion owed to the banks setting a record for all companies .
boeing had a monopoly in very large planes making for many years .
on january 15,1970 , first lady of the united states pat nixon christened pan am 's first 747 .
instead of champagne , red , white and blue water was sprayed on the plane .
the 747 was first used on january 22,1970 .
finding a substitute delayed the flight by more than six hours to the next day when clipper victor was used .
the 747 was a fairly smooth introduction into service .
after pan am bought the 747 , other airlines began to use their 747s .
boeing said that half of the early 747 sales were to airlines .
while the 747 had the lowest potential operating cost per seat , this could only be achieved when the plane was fully loaded ; costs per seat increased rapidly as occupancy declined .
a moderately loaded 747 , one with only 70 percent of its seats occupied , used more than 95 percent of the fuel needed by a 747 .
however , many flag-carriers bought the 747 because it was so good to " even if it made no sense economically " to operate .
during the 1970s and 1980s , there was often over 30 regular 747s at john f . kennedy international airport .
for the year and a half after september 1970 , it only sold two 747s in the world .
after the 1973 oil crisis , several airlines found they did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 .
in 1983 , delta air lines also removed its 747s from service after several years .
delta airlines bought the 747-400 in 2008 .
flights which landed at smaller cities became more common in the 1980s .
in japan , 747s on domestic routes were designed to carry the maximum passenger capacity .
after the initial 747-100 , boeing made the − 100b .
the-200 model was made in 1971 .
the 747sp ( special performance occurred in 1976 .
the 300 series resulted from boeing studies to increase the seating capacity of the 747 .
the cockpit had a new glass cockpit , which allowed for a cockpit crew of two instead of three , new engines , and a redesigned interior .
the 747 was the heaviest commercial plane in regular service until the first 747-124 was made in 1982 .
the antonov an-225 " mriya " cargo transport , which first appeared in 1988 , remains the world 's largest aircraft .
the new planes would have cost more than us $ 5 billion to design .
however , the 747x family was unable to get enough interest to make the 747x .
a year later , boeing began concentrating on the sonic cruiser .
the 747 advanced used the same technology from the 787 to modernize the design and its systems .
the 747 was the largest passenger airliner in service until the airbus a380 began to be used in 2007 .
the last 747-400s were made in 2009 .
the 747-8 has been made for the freighter version .
cargolux got the first 747-8 in 2011 .
on january 29,2016 , boeing said that it will work on a 747-8 for the next air force one presidential aircraft .
on july 12,2016 , it was announced that it had finalized terms of acquisition with volga-dnepr group for 20 747-8 freighters , valued at $ 7.58 billion at list prices .
the new 747-8 freighters will replace the 747-400 aircraft and expand the airline 's fleet .
on july 27,2016 , in its quarterly report to the securities and exchange commission , boeing said that the 747 would end due to insufficient demand and market for the aircraft .
with a firm order backlog of 21 aircraft and a production rate of 6 per year , program accounting has been reduced to 1,555 aircraft , and the 747 line could be closed in the third quarter of 2019 .
the backlog then stood at 25 aircraft , though several of these are orders from airlines that no longer meant to take delivery .
its wings have a high sweep angle of 37.5 degrees for a fast , efficient cruise speed of mach 0.84 to 0.88 , depending on the variant .
the " stretched upper deck " became available as an alternative to the 747-100b version and later as standard beginning on the 747-300 .
the 747 has redundant structures along with four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears each with four wheels .
the 747 also has split control surfaces .
the 747-400 carries the orbital-class rocket to fly altitude .
several versions of each variant have been made .
the first 747-100s had six windows .
later , airlines began to use the upper deck for premium passengers instead of using lounge space .
no freighter version of this model was made , but many 747-100s were changed into freighters .
responding to requests from japanese airlines for a high capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities , boeing made the 747sr as a short range version of the 747-100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability .
with increased economy class seating , up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models .
the 747sr had an economic design for 52,000 flights .
the first 747sr model , the-100sr , had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the extra stress accumulated from a greater number of takeoffs and landings .
the first-100sr entered service with jal on october 7,1973 .
after the − 100sr , boeing made the-100bsr , a 747sr version with increased takeoff weight .
it first flew on november 3,1978 .
ana operated this variant on domestic japanese routes with 455 or 456 seats until retiring its last aircraft in march 2006 .
it has 563 seats on domestic routes .
while only two-100bsr suds were produced , in theory , standard-100bs can be changed to the sud certification .
the 747-100b model was made from the − 100sr .
it was delivered the next day .
the development of the 747sp started with a joint request between pan american world airways and iran air .
the 747sp had a tapering of the back part of the body , a double-hinged rudder , and longer vertical and horizontal stabilizers .
the 747sp was granted a supplemental certificate on february 4,1976 .
in 1987 , boeing re-opened the 747sp production line after five years to build one last 747sp for an order by the united arab emirates government .
one 747sp was used for the nasa / german aerospace center sofia experiment .
iran air is the last civil operator of the type .
the 747-100 had pratt & whitney jt9d-3a engines .
the demand for longer range aircraft with increased payload quickly led to the improved-200 , which featured more powerful engines , increased mtow , and greater range than the − 100 .
a few early-200s kept the three-window configuration of the-100 on the upper deck , but most were built with a ten-window configuration on each side .
the 747-200b was the basic version of the 747-200 .
in its first three years of making , the-200 was able to have pratt & whitney jt9d-7 engines illustrating the only engine available elsewhere .
range with a full passenger load started at over 5000 nmi and increased to 6000 nmi with later engines .
most-200bs had an upper deck , allowing for up to 16 seats .
the convertible version , the 747-200c , could be changed between a passenger and a freighter .
the-200c could also be fitted with an optional side cargo door on the main deck .
the 747-200m model could carry freight in the rear section of the main deck .
a removable partition on the main deck separated the cargo area at the rear from the passengers at the front .
as on the-100 , a stretched upper deck twain was later offered .
on august 1,1972 , boeing said that it had reached an agreement with general electric to make the 747 with cf6-50 .
the − 200 was the first 747 to be used by airlines .
it is the most visible difference between the-300 and previous models .
before being made into the 747-300 , the stretched upper deck was a retrofit , and appeared on two japanese 747-100sr aircraft .
the 747-300 introduced a new straight stairway to the upper deck .
this allowed the-300 's cruise speed to reach mach 0.85 compared with mach 0.84 on the-200 and-100 models , while retaining the same takeoff weight .
the-300 could have the same pratt & whitney and rolls-royce engines as on the-200 .
the 747-300 was used for a design study .
the 747-300m has cargo capacity on the rear part of the main deck , similar to the 747-200m .
the 747-300sr was a short range , high-capacity domestic model .
however , boeing began using the 747-300 models into freighters in 2000 .
in 1985 , just two years after the 747 first arrived , the 747 was made .
air france , air india , pakistan international airlines , and qantas were some of the last major airlines to use the 747-300 .
qantas flew its last 747-300 service , which was scheduled to operate from melbourne to los angeles via auckland .
the 747-400 is a new type of 747 .
it has wingtip extensions of 6 ft and winglets of 6 ft .
the 747-400 introduced a new glass cockpit .
the longer range has been used by some airlines to bypass traditional fuel stops , such as anchorage .
both aircraft can use the same three engines .
the first passenger version of the plane was in february 1989 .
in 2004 , boeing and cathay pacific launched the boeing 747-400 special freighter program .
in march 2007 , boeing said it had no plans to make more planes .
however , orders for 36-400f and-400erf were already in place at the time of the announcement .
the last passenger version of the 747-400 was delivered in april 2005 to china airlines .
some of the last 747-400s were made with dreamliner livery along with the modern signature interior from the boeing 777 .
the largest 747-400 operator has included singapore airlines , japan airlines , and british airways with 36 as of july 2018 .
as of july 2018,339 747-400s remain in service .
evergreen aviation technologies corporation of taiwan was contracted to complete changes of 747-400s into dreamlifters in taoyuan .
the dreamlifters have been placed into service taking sub-assemblies for the 787 program to the boeing plant in everett , washington , for final assembly .
the 747-8 is the most used type of 747 , so the 747-8 is used .
the 747-8 's body is 232 to 251 feet wide .
the 747-8f also has a side-door on the main deck .
it received its amended type certificate .
the 747-8 is a version of the 747-400 .
during the late 1960s and early 1970s , boeing studied the making of a shorter 747 with three engines .
the engine would have been fitted in the tail with an s-duct intake similar to the l-1011 's .
the 747 trijet would carry more passengers than the 747 .
in january 1986 , boeing wanted to make a bigger version of the 747-500 .
the version would use more efficient unducted fanciful fanciful engines ashore to make the upper deck .
this plane would have combined the advanced technology used on the 747-400 with the foreshortened 747sp fuselage .
however , airlines were not interested in the project and it was canceled in 1988 in favor of the 777 .
other changes included adding more powerful engines and increasing the number of tires from two to four on the nose landing gear and from 16 to 20 on the main landing gear .
this would have combined the wing of the 747-600x with a widened fuselage , allowing it to carry 650 passengers over the same range as a 747-400 .
the new wing for the 747-500x was said to be more than $ 5 billion .
boeing was not able to get enough interest to launch the plane .
as airbus progressed with its a3xx study , boeing offered a 747 version as an alternative in 2000 .
power would have been supplied by either the engine alliance gp7172 or the rolls-royce trent 600 .
like the 747x family , the 747x family was unable to get enough interest to make the 747x .
the 747x did not make it beyond the drawing board .
after the end of the 747x program , boeing continued to study improvements that could be made to the 747 .
the 747-400xqlrlrlrlrlrlr was meant to have an increased range of 7,980 nmi ; 9,200 mi , 14,800 km .
improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400er and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction .
however , many of its features were used for the 747 advanced , which has now been launched as the 747-8 .
the airline is now the largest operator with 36 747-400s .
the last u . s . passenger boeing 747 was retired from delta air lines in december 2017 , after it flew for every american major carrier since 1970 .
delta flew three of its last four aircraft on a farewell tour , from seattle to atlanta on december 19 , then to los angeles and minneapolis on december 20 .
the iata forecast forecast forecasts an increase in air freight from 4 % to 5 % in 2018 .
of the 1,544 produced , 890 are retired .
this helped the airframer financing arm boeing capital to shrink its exposure to the 747-8 from $ 1.07 billion in 2017 to $ 481 million .
there were also 24 deaths in 32 aircraft hijackings , such as pan am flight 73 .
united airlines flight 811 was a mistake that the boeing 747-100 and 747-200 cargo doors were designed .
the flight was shot down by a soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 .
this finding led the faa to a rule requiring installation of an inerting system in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft that was adopted in july 2008 .
some have found their way into museums or other uses .
when it was retired , the 747 number two was taken apart and shipped to hopyeonggi-do , south korea .
a former british airways 747-200b , g-bdxj , is parked at the dunsfold aerodrome in surrey , england .
the plane also appears in the bbc television series " top gear " , which is filmed at dunsfold .
the jumbohostel was a 747-200 which was registered as 9v-sqe .
the wings of a 747 have been used as roofs of a house in malibu , california .
it is seen in over 300 movie productions .
the plane was nicknamed " queen of the skies " .
