[CLS] its distinctive hum ##p upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft has made it one of the most recognizable aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] manufactured by boeing ' s commercial airplane unit in the united states , the 747 was originally planned to have 150 percent greater capacity than the boeing 70 ##7 , a common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s . [SEP]
[CLS] the quad ##jet 747 uses a double - deck configuration for part of its length and is available in passenger , freighter , and other versions . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing designed the 747 ' s hum ##p - like upper deck to serve as a first - class lounge or extra seating , and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing expected super ##sonic airline ##rs — the development of which was announced in the early 1960s — to render the 747 and other sub ##sonic airline ##rs obsolete , while the demand for sub ##sonic cargo aircraft would remain robust well into the future . [SEP]
[CLS] the newest version of the aircraft , the 747 - 8 , is in production and received certification in 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] although the c - 141 star ##lift ##er was being introduced , officials believed that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed , especially to carry cargo that would not fit in any existing aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 1964 , air ##frame proposals arrived from boeing , douglas , general dynamics , lockheed , and martin marie ##tta ; engine proposals were submitted by general electric , curtiss - wright , and pratt & whitney . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing , douglas , and lockheed were given additional study contracts for the air ##frame , along with general electric and pratt & whitney for the engines . [SEP]
[CLS] all of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area ; douglas had a small " pod " just forward and above the wing , lockheed used a long " spine " running the length of the aircraft with the wing spa ##r passing through it , while boeing blended the two , with a longer pod that ran from just behind the nose to just behind the wing . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1965 , lockheed ' s aircraft design and general electric ' s engine design were selected for the new c - 5 galaxy transport , which was the largest military aircraft in the world at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] the nose door and raised cockpit concepts would be carried over to the design of the 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 was conceived while air travel was increasing in the 1960s . [SEP]
[CLS] the era of commercial jet transportation , led by the enormous popularity of the boeing 70 ##7 and douglas dc - 8 , had revolution ##ized long - distance travel . [SEP]
[CLS] even before it lost the c ##x - h ##ls contract , boeing was asked by juan trip ##pe , president of pan american world airways ( pan am ) , one of their most important airline customers , to build a passenger aircraft more than twice the size of the 70 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] during this time , airport congestion , worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft , became a problem that trip ##pe thought could be addressed by a larger new aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1965 , joe su ##tter was transferred from boeing ' s 737 development team to manage the design studies for the new airline ##r , already assigned the model number 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time , it was widely thought that the 747 would eventually be superseded by super ##sonic transport aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing responded by designing the 747 so that it could be adapted easily to carry freight and remain in production even if sales of the passenger version declined . [SEP]
[CLS] in the freighter role , the clear need was to support the container ##ized shipping method ##ologies that were being widely introduced at about the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] this meant that it would be possible to support a 2 - wide 2 - high stack of containers two or three ranks deep with a fuselage size similar to the earlier c ##x - h ##ls project . [SEP]
[CLS] during the ceremonial 747 contract - signing banquet in seattle on boeing ' s 50th anniversary , juan trip ##pe predicted that the 747 would be " . . . a great weapon for peace , competing with intercontinental missiles for mankind ' s destiny " . [SEP]
[CLS] as launch customer , and because of its early involvement before placing a formal order , pan am was able to influence the design and development of the 747 to an extent un ##mat ##ched by a single airline before or since . [SEP]
[CLS] however , concern over evacuation routes and limited cargo - carrying capability caused this idea to be scrapped in early 1966 in favor of a wider single deck design . [SEP]
[CLS] the cockpit was , therefore , placed on a shortened upper deck so that a freight - loading door could be included in the nose cone ; this design feature produced the 747 ' s distinctive " bulge " . [SEP]
[CLS] ( a different configuration that had been considered in order to keep the flight deck out of the way for freight loading had the pilots below the passengers , and was dubbed the " ant ##ea ##ter " . ) [SEP]
[CLS] one of the principal technologies that enabled an aircraft as large as the 747 to be drawn up was the high - bypass turbo ##fan engine . [SEP]
[CLS] general electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the c - 5 galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later . [SEP]
[CLS] pratt & whitney was also working on the same principle and , by late 1966 , boeing , pan am and pratt & whitney agreed to develop a new engine , designated the j ##t ##9 ##d to power the 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] the project was designed with a new methodology called fault tree analysis , which allowed the effects of a failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , some of the most advanced high - lift devices used in the industry were included in the new design , to allow it to operate from existing airports . [SEP]
[CLS] the wing ' s complex three - part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non - deployed configuration . [SEP]
[CLS] as boeing did not have a plant large enough to assemble the giant airline ##r , they chose to build a new plant . [SEP]
[CLS] the company considered locations in about 50 cities , and eventually decided to build the new plant some 30 mi north of seattle on a site adjoining a military base at pain ##e field near everett , washington . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing president william m . allen asked malcolm t . stamp ##er , then head of the company ' s turbine division , to oversee construction of the everett factory and to start production of the 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] the plant is the largest building by volume ever built , and has been substantially expanded several times to permit construction of other models of boeing wide - body commercial jets . [SEP]
[CLS] one important test involved the evacuation of 560 volunteers from a cabin mock - up via the aircraft ' s emergency chu ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] the first full - scale evacuation took two and a half minutes instead of the maximum of 90 seconds mandated by the federal aviation administration ( faa ) , and several volunteers were injured . [SEP]
[CLS] most problematic was evacuation from the aircraft ' s upper deck ; instead of using a conventional slide , volunteer passengers escaped by using a harness attached to a reel . [SEP]
[CLS] while the first 747 ##s were still being built , the device allowed pilots to practice taxi maneuvers from a high upper - deck position . [SEP]
[CLS] on september 30 , 1968 , the first 747 was rolled out of the everett assembly building before the world ' s press and representatives of the 26 airlines that had ordered the airline ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] over the following months , preparations were made for the first flight , which took place on february 9 , 1969 , with test pilots jack wa ##dd ##ell and brien w ##y ##gle at the controls and jess wall ##ick at the flight engineer ' s station . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 was found to be largely immune to " dutch roll " , a phenomenon that had been a major hazard to the early swept - wing jets . [SEP]
[CLS] during later stages of the flight test program , flutter testing showed that the wings suffered os ##ci ##llation under certain conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a particularly severe high - speed flutter problem was solved only by insert ##ing depleted uranium counter ##weight ##s as ballast in the out ##board engine na ##cel ##les of the early 747 ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this measure caused anxiety when these aircraft crashed , for example el al flight 1862 at amsterdam in 1992 with 282 kg of uranium in the tail ##plane ( horizontal stabilize ##r ) . [SEP]
[CLS] difficulties included engine stalls caused by rapid throttle movements and distortion of the turbine cas ##ings after a short period of service . [SEP]
[CLS] the problems delayed 747 deliveries for several months ; up to 20 aircraft at the everett plant were stranded while awaiting engine installation . [SEP]
[CLS] the program was further delayed when one of the five test aircraft suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at rent ##on municipal airport , site of the company ' s rent ##on factory . [SEP]
[CLS] on december 13 , 1969 a test aircraft was being taken to have test equipment removed and a cabin installed when pilot ralph c . coke ##ly under ##shot the airport ' s short runway . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 ' s right , outer landing gear was torn off and two engine na ##cel ##les were damaged . [SEP]
[CLS] however , these difficulties did not prevent boeing from taking a test aircraft to the 28th paris air show in mid - 1969 , where it was displayed to the public for the first time . [SEP]
[CLS] the huge cost of developing the 747 and building the everett factory meant that boeing had to borrow heavily from a banking syndicate . [SEP]
[CLS] during the final months before delivery of the first aircraft , the company had to repeatedly request additional funding to complete the project . [SEP]
[CLS] the firm ' s debt exceeded $ 2 billion , with the $ 1 . 2 billion owed to the banks setting a record for all companies . [SEP]
[CLS] ultimately , the gamble succeeded , and boeing held a monopoly in very large passenger aircraft production for many years . [SEP]
[CLS] on january 15 , 1970 , first lady of the united states pat nixon christ ##ened pan am ' s first 747 , at dull ##es international airport ( later washington dull ##es international airport ) in the presence of pan am chairman na ##jee ##b hal ##aby . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of champagne , red , white , and blue water was sprayed on the aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 entered service on january 22 , 1970 , on pan am ' s new york – london route ; the flight had been planned for the evening of january 21 , but engine over ##hea ##ting made the original aircraft un ##usa ##ble . [SEP]
[CLS] finding a substitute delayed the flight by more than six hours to the following day when clip ##per victor was used . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 enjoyed a fairly smooth introduction into service , overcoming concerns that some airports would not be able to accommodate an aircraft that large . [SEP]
[CLS] after the aircraft ' s introduction with pan am , other airlines that had bought the 747 to stay competitive began to put their own 747 ##s into service . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing estimated that half of the early 747 sales were to airlines des ##iring the aircraft ' s long range rather than its payload capacity . [SEP]
[CLS] while the 747 had the lowest potential operating cost per seat , this could only be achieved when the aircraft was fully loaded ; costs per seat increased rapidly as o ##cc ##up ##ancy declined . [SEP]
[CLS] a moderately loaded 747 , one with only 70 percent of its seats occupied , used more than 95 percent of the fuel needed by a fully occupied 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , many flag - carriers purchased the 747 due to its prestige " even if it made no sense economically " to operate . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1970s and 1980s , there was often over 30 regularly scheduled 747 ##s at john f . kennedy international airport . [SEP]
[CLS] for the year and a half after september 1970 it only sold two 747 ##s in the world , and did not sell any to an american carrier for almost three years . [SEP]
[CLS] when economic problems in the us and other countries after the 1973 oil crisis led to reduced passenger traffic , several airlines found they did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 economically , and they replaced them with the smaller and recently introduced mcdonnell douglas dc - 10 and lockheed l - 101 ##1 tri ##star tri ##jet wide bodies ( and later the 76 ##7 and a ##30 ##0 / a ##31 ##0 twin ##jet ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] having tried replacing coach seats on its 747 ##s with piano bars in an attempt to attract more customers , american airlines eventually relegated its 747 ##s to cargo service and in 1983 exchanged them with pan am for smaller aircraft ; delta air lines also removed its 747 ##s from service after several years . [SEP]
[CLS] later , delta acquired 747 ##s again in 2008 as part of its merger with northwest airlines , although it retired the 747 - 400 fleet in december 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] international flights bypass ##ing traditional hub airports and landing at smaller cities became more common throughout the 1980s , thus er ##od ##ing the 747 ' s original market . [SEP]
[CLS] in japan , 747 ##s on domestic routes were configured to carry nearly the maximum passenger capacity . [SEP]
[CLS] after the initial 747 - 100 , boeing developed the - 100 ##b , a higher maximum takeoff weight ( mt ##ow ) variant , and the - 100 ##sr ( short range ) , with higher passenger capacity . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 200 model followed in 1971 , featuring more powerful engines and a higher mt ##ow . [SEP]
[CLS] the shortened 747 ##sp ( special performance ) with a longer range was also developed , and entered service in 1976 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 300 series resulted from boeing studies to increase the seating capacity of the 747 , during which modifications such as fuselage plug ##s and extending the upper deck over the entire length of the fuselage were rejected . [SEP]
[CLS] the variant had a new glass cockpit , which allowed for a cockpit crew of two instead of three , new engines , lighter construction materials , and a redesigned interior . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 remained the heaviest commercial aircraft in regular service until the debut of the anton ##ov an - 124 rus ##lan in 1982 ; variants of the 747 - 400 surpassed the an - 124 ' s weight in 2000 . [SEP]
[CLS] the anton ##ov an - 225 " mri ##ya " cargo transport , which debuted in 1988 , remains the world ' s largest aircraft by several measures ( including the most accepted measures of maximum takeoff weight and length ) ; one aircraft has been completed and is in service as of 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] the new variants would have cost more than us $ 5 billion to develop , and interest was not sufficient to launch the program . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the 747 ##x family was unable to attract enough interest to enter production . [SEP]
[CLS] a year later , boeing switched from the 747 ##x studies to pursue the sonic cruiser , and after the sonic cruiser program was put on hold , the 78 ##7 dream ##liner . [SEP]
[CLS] similar in nature to the 747 - x , the stretched 747 advanced used technology from the 78 ##7 to modern ##ize the design and its systems . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 remained the largest passenger airline ##r in service until the airbus a ##38 ##0 began airline service in 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] the last 747 - 400 ##s were completed in 2009 . [SEP]
[CLS] s of 2011 , most orders of the 747 - 8 have been for the freighter variant . [SEP]
[CLS] the first delivery of the 747 - 8 went to cargo ##lux in 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] on january 29 , 2016 , boeing announced that it had begun the preliminary work on the modifications to a commercial 747 - 8 for the next air force one presidential aircraft , expected to be operational by 2020 . [SEP]
[CLS] on july 12 , 2016 , boeing announced that it had finalized terms of acquisition with volga - d ##ne ##pr group for 20 747 - 8 freighter ##s , valued at $ 7 . 58 billion at list prices . [SEP]
[CLS] the new 747 - 8 freighter ##s will replace air ##bridge ##car ##go ' s current 747 - 400 aircraft and expand the airline ' s fleet and will be acquired through a mix of direct purchases and leasing over the next six years , boeing said . [SEP]
[CLS] on july 27 , 2016 , in its quarterly report to the securities and exchange commission , boeing discussed the potential termination of 747 production due to insufficient demand and market for the aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] with a firm order back ##log of 21 aircraft and a production rate of six per year , program accounting has been reduced to 1 , 555 aircraft , and the 747 line could be closed in the third quarter of 2019 . [SEP]
[CLS] the back ##log then stood at 25 aircraft , though several of these are orders from airlines that no longer intend to take delivery . [SEP]
[CLS] its wings have a high sweep angle of 37 . 5 degrees for a fast , efficient cruise speed of mach 0 . 84 to 0 . 88 , depending on the variant . [SEP]
[CLS] the " stretched upper deck " became available as an alternative on the 747 - 100 ##b variant and later as standard beginning on the 747 - 300 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 has redundant structures along with four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears each with four wheels ; these provide a good spread of support on the ground and safety in case of tire blow - outs . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 also has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple - slot ##ted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard - length runways . [SEP]
[CLS] virgin orbit ' s 747 - 400 , dubbed cosmic girl , carries the orbital - class rocket to cruise altitude , where the rocket is deployed and then carries its small satellite payload the rest of the way to space . [SEP]
[CLS] several versions of each variant have been produced , and many of the early variants were in production simultaneously . [SEP]
[CLS] the first 747 - 100 ##s were built with six upper deck windows ( three per side ) to accommodate upstairs lounge areas . [SEP]
[CLS] later , as airlines began to use the upper deck for premium passenger seating instead of lounge space , boeing offered a ten - window upper deck as an option . [SEP]
[CLS] no freighter version of this model was developed , but many 747 - 100 ##s were converted into freighter ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] responding to requests from japanese airlines for a high - capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities , boeing developed the 747 ##sr as a short - range version of the 747 - 100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability . [SEP]
[CLS] with increased economy class seating , up to 49 ##8 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 ##sr had an economic design life objective of 52 , 000 flights during 20 years of operation , compared to 24 , 600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial 747 ##sr model , the - 100 ##sr , had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from a greater number of takeoff ##s and landings . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 100 ##sr entered service with ja ##l , the type ' s sole customer , on october 7 , 1973 , and typically operated flights within japan . [SEP]
[CLS] following the - 100 ##sr , boeing produced the - 100 ##bs ##r , a 747 ##sr variant with increased takeoff weight capability . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 100 ##bs ##r first flew on november 3 , 1978 , with first delivery to all nippon airways ( ana ) on december 21 , 1978 . [SEP]
[CLS] ana operated this variant on domestic japanese routes with 45 ##5 or 45 ##6 seats until retiring its last aircraft in march 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] ja ##l operated the - 100 ##bs ##r sud with 56 ##3 seats on domestic routes until their retirement in the third quarter of 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] while only two - 100 ##bs ##r sud ##s were produced , in theory , standard - 100 ##bs can be modified to the sud certification . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 100 ##b model was developed from the - 100 ##sr , using its stronger air ##frame and landing gear design . [SEP]
[CLS] this aircraft first flew on june 20 , 1979 , received faa certification on august 1 , 1979 , and was delivered the next day . [SEP]
[CLS] the development of the 747 ##sp stemmed from a joint request between pan american world airways and iran air , who were looking for a high - capacity airline ##r with enough range to cover pan am ' s new york – middle eastern routes and iran air ' s planned tehran – new york route . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 ##sp , compared to earlier variants , had a tape ##ring of the aft upper fuselage into the em ##pen ##nage , a double - hi ##nged rudder , and longer vertical and horizontal stabilize ##rs . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 ##sp was granted a supplemental certificate on february 4 , 1976 and entered service with launch customers pan am and iran air that same year . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1987 , boeing re - opened the 747 ##sp production line after five years to build one last 747 ##sp for an order by the united arab emirates government . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to airline use , one 747 ##sp was modified for the nasa / german aerospace center sofia experiment . [SEP]
[CLS] iran air is the last civil operator of the type ; its final 747 - sp ( ep - ia ##c ) was to be retired in june 2016 . [SEP]
[CLS] while the 747 - 100 powered by pratt & whitney j ##t ##9 ##d - 3a engines offered enough payload and range for medium - haul operations , it was marginal for long - haul route sectors . [SEP]
[CLS] the demand for longer range aircraft with increased payload quickly led to the improved - 200 , which featured more powerful engines , increased mt ##ow , and greater range than the - 100 . [SEP]
[CLS] a few early - 200 ##s retained the three - window configuration of the - 100 on the upper deck , but most were built with a ten - window configuration on each side . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 200 ##b was the basic passenger version , with increased fuel capacity and more powerful engines ; it entered service in february 1971 . [SEP]
[CLS] in its first three years of production , the - 200 was equipped with pratt & whitney j ##t ##9 ##d - 7 engines ( initially the only engine available ) . [SEP]
[CLS] range with a full passenger load started at over 5000 nmi and increased to 6000 nmi with later engines . [SEP]
[CLS] most - 200 ##bs had an internally stretched upper deck , allowing for up to 16 passenger seats . [SEP]
[CLS] the convertible version , the 747 - 200 ##c , could be converted between a passenger and a freighter or used in mixed configurations , and featured re ##movable seats and a nose cargo door . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 200 ##c could also be fitted with an optional side cargo door on the main deck . [SEP]
[CLS] the comb ##i model , the 747 - 200 ##m , could carry freight in the rear section of the main deck via a side cargo door . [SEP]
[CLS] a re ##movable partition on the main deck separated the cargo area at the rear from the passengers at the front . [SEP]
[CLS] as on the - 100 , a stretched upper deck ( sud ) modification was later offered . [SEP]
[CLS] after launching the - 200 with pratt & whitney j ##t ##9 ##d - 7 engines , on august 1 , 1972 boeing announced that it had reached an agreement with general electric to ce ##rti ##fy the 747 with cf ##6 - 50 series engines to increase the aircraft ' s market potential . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 200 was the first 747 to provide a choice of powerplant from the three major engine manufacturers . [SEP]
[CLS] the stretched upper deck has two emergency exit doors and is the most visible difference between the - 300 and previous models . [SEP]
[CLS] before being made standard on the 747 - 300 , the stretched upper deck was previously offered as a retro ##fi ##t , and appeared on two japanese 747 - 100 ##sr aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 300 introduced a new straight stairway to the upper deck , instead of a spiral staircase on earlier variants , which creates room above and below for more seats . [SEP]
[CLS] minor aerodynamic changes allowed the - 300 ' s cruise speed to reach mach 0 . 85 compared with mach 0 . 84 on the - 200 and - 100 models , while retaining the same takeoff weight . [SEP]
[CLS] the - 300 could be equipped with the same pratt & whitney and rolls - royce powerplant ##s as on the - 200 , as well as updated general electric cf ##6 - 80 ##c ##2 ##b ##1 engines . [SEP]
[CLS] the variant revived the 747 - 300 designation , which had been previously used on a design study that did not reach production . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 300 ##m features cargo capacity on the rear portion of the main deck , similar to the - 200 ##m , but with the stretched upper deck it can carry more passengers . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 300 ##sr , a short range , high - capacity domestic model , was produced for japanese markets with a maximum seating for 58 ##4 . [SEP]
[CLS] no production freighter version of the 747 - 300 was built , but boeing began modifications of used passenger - 300 models into freighter ##s in 2000 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1985 , just two years after the - 300 entered service , the type was superseded by the announcement of the more advanced 747 - 400 . [SEP]
[CLS] air france , air india , pakistan international airlines , and q ##anta ##s were some of the last major carriers to operate the 747 - 300 . [SEP]
[CLS] on december 29 , 2008 , q ##anta ##s flew its last scheduled 747 - 300 service , operating from melbourne to los angeles via auckland . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 400 is an improved model with increased range . [SEP]
[CLS] it has wing ##tip extensions of 6 ft and wing ##lets of 6 ft , which improve the type ' s fuel efficiency by four percent compared to previous 747 versions . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 400 introduced a new glass cockpit designed for a flight crew of two instead of three , with a reduction in the number of dial ##s , gauge ##s and knob ##s from 97 ##1 to 365 through the use of electronics . [SEP]
[CLS] the longer range has been used by some airlines to bypass traditional fuel stops , such as anchorage . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result of the boeing 76 ##7 development overlapping with the 747 - 400 ' s development , both aircraft can use the same three powerplant ##s and are even interchange ##able between the two aircraft models . [SEP]
[CLS] the passenger version first entered service in february 1989 with launch customer northwest airlines on the minneapolis to phoenix route . [SEP]
[CLS] in january 2004 , boeing and cat ##hay pacific launched the boeing 747 - 400 special freighter program , later referred to as the boeing converted freighter ( bc ##f ) , to modify passenger 747 - 400 ##s for cargo use . [SEP]
[CLS] in march 2007 , boeing announced that it had no plans to produce further passenger versions of the - 400 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , orders for 36 - 400 ##f and - 400 ##er ##f freighter ##s were already in place at the time of the announcement . [SEP]
[CLS] the last passenger version of the 747 - 400 was delivered in april 2005 to china airlines . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the last built 747 - 400 ##s were delivered with dream ##liner livery along with the modern signature interior from the boeing 77 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] at various times , the largest 747 - 400 operator has included singapore airlines , japan airlines , and british airways with 36 as of july 2018 . [SEP]
[CLS] s of july 2018 , 339 747 - 400 ##s remain in service . [SEP]
[CLS] evergreen aviation technologies corporation of taiwan was contracted to complete modifications of 747 - 400 ##s into dream ##lift ##ers in tao ##yuan . [SEP]
[CLS] the dream ##lift ##ers have been placed into service transporting sub - assemblies for the 78 ##7 program to the boeing plant in everett , washington , for final assembly . [SEP]
[CLS] referred to as the 747 advanced prior to its launch , the 747 - 8 uses the same engine and cockpit technology as the 78 ##7 , hence the use of the " 8 " . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 8 ' s fuselage is length ##ened from 232 to 251 feet ( 70 . 8 to 76 . 4 m ) , marking the first stretch variant of the aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] as on previous 747 freighter ##s , the 747 - 8 ##f features an overhead nose - door and a side - door on the main deck plus a side - door on the lower deck ( " belly " ) to aid loading and un ##loading . [SEP]
[CLS] the variant received its amended type certificate jointly from the faa and the european aviation safety agency ( ea ##sa ) on august 19 , 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] as a derivative of the already common 747 - 400 , the 747 - 8 has the economic benefit of similar training and interchange ##able parts . [SEP]
[CLS] during the late 1960s and early 1970s , boeing studied the development of a shorter 747 with three engines , to compete with the smaller lockheed l - 101 ##1 tri ##star and mcdonnell douglas dc - 10 . [SEP]
[CLS] the center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an s - duct intake similar to the l - 101 ##1 ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] overall , the 747 tri ##jet would have had more payload , range , and passenger capacity than both of them . [SEP]
[CLS] in january 1986 , boeing outlined preliminary studies to build a larger , ultra - long haul version named the 747 - 500 , which would enter service in the mid - to late - 1990s . [SEP]
[CLS] the derivative would use more efficient und ##uc ##ted fan ( ud ##f ) engines ( prop ##fan ##s ) made by general electric , be stretched ( including the upper deck section ) to a capacity of 500 seats , have a new wing to reduce drag , cruise at a faster speed to reduce flight times , and have a range of at least 1000 ##0 mi , which would allow airlines to fly nonstop between london , england and sydney , australia . [SEP]
[CLS] this aircraft design would have combined the advanced technology used on the 747 - 400 with the fore ##sho ##rte ##ned 747 ##sp fuselage . [SEP]
[CLS] however , airlines were not interested in the project and it was canceled in 1988 in favor of the 77 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] other changes included adding more powerful engines and increasing the number of tires from two to four on the nose landing gear and from 16 to 20 on the main landing gear . [SEP]
[CLS] a third study concept , the 747 - 700 ##x , would have combined the wing of the 747 - 600 ##x with a widened fuselage , allowing it to carry 650 passengers over the same range as a 747 - 400 . [SEP]
[CLS] the cost of the changes from previous 747 models , in particular the new wing for the 747 - 500 ##x and - 600 ##x , was estimated to be more than us $ 5 billion . [SEP]
[CLS] boeing was not able to attract enough interest to launch the aircraft . [SEP]
[CLS] as airbus progressed with its a ##3 ##xx study , boeing offered a 747 derivative as an alternative in 2000 ; a more modest proposal than the previous - 500 ##x and - 600 ##x that retained the 747 ' s overall wing design and add a segment at the root , increasing the span to 229 ft . [SEP]
[CLS] power would have been supplied by either the engine alliance gp ##7 ##17 ##2 or the rolls - royce trent 600 , which were also proposed for the 76 ##7 - 400 ##er ##x . [SEP]
[CLS] like its predecessor , the 747 ##x family was unable to garner enough interest to justify production , and it was she ##lved along with the 76 ##7 - 400 ##er ##x in march 2001 , when boeing announced the sonic cruiser concept . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 ##x did not make it beyond the drawing board , but the 747 - 400 ##x being developed concurrently moved into production to become the 747 - 400 ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] after the end of the 747 ##x program , boeing continued to study improvements that could be made to the 747 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 747 - 400 ##x ##q ##lr ( quiet long range ) was meant to have an increased range of 7 , 980 nmi ( 9 , 200 mi , 14 , 800 km ) , with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise . [SEP]
[CLS] improvements studied included raked wing ##tip ##s similar to those used on the 76 ##7 - 400 ##er and a saw ##tooth engine na ##cel ##le for noise reduction . [SEP]
[CLS] although the 747 - 400 ##x ##q ##lr did not move to production , many of its features were used for the 747 advanced , which has now been launched as the 747 - 8 . [SEP]
[CLS] s of july 2018 , 46 ##2 boeing 747 ##s are in airline service , with british airways being the largest operator with 36 747 - 400 ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the last us passenger boeing 747 was retired from delta air lines in december 2017 , after it flew for every american major carrier since its 1970 introduction . [SEP]
[CLS] delta flew three of its last four aircraft on a farewell tour , from seattle to atlanta on december 19 then to los angeles and minneapolis / st paul on december 20 . [SEP]
[CLS] as the iata forecast an increase in air freight from 4 % to 5 % in 2018 fuel ##led by booming trade for time - sensitive goods , from smartphone ##s to fresh flowers , demand for freighter ##s is strong while passenger 747 ##s are phased out . [SEP]
[CLS] of the 1 , 54 ##4 produced , 89 ##0 are retired ; as of 2018 , a small subset of those which were intended to be parted - out get $ 3 million d - checks before flying again . [SEP]
[CLS] this comeback helped the air ##frame ##r financing arm boeing capital to shrink its exposure to the 747 - 8 from $ 1 . 07 billion in 2017 to $ 48 ##1 million . [SEP]
[CLS] there were also 24 deaths in 32 aircraft hi ##jack ##ings , such as pan am flight 73 where a boeing 747 - 121 was hi ##jack ##ed by four terrorists and resulted in 20 deaths . [SEP]
[CLS] united airlines flight 81 ##1 , which suffered an explosive deco ##mp ##ress ##ion mid - flight on february 24 , 1989 , led the national transportation safety board ( nt ##sb ) to issue a recommendation that the boeing 747 - 100 and 747 - 200 cargo doors similar to those on the flight 81 ##1 aircraft be modified to those featured on the boeing 747 - 400 . [SEP]
[CLS] korean air lines flight 00 ##7 was shot down by a soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 after it had stray ##ed into soviet territory , causing u . s . president ronald reagan to author ##ize the then - strictly military global positioning system ( gps ) for civilian use . [SEP]
[CLS] accidents due to design def ##iciencies included t ##wa flight 800 , where a 747 - 100 exploded in mid - air on july 17 , 1996 , probably due to spark ##ing electricity wires inside the fuel tank ; this finding led the faa to propose a rule requiring installation of an in ##ert ##ing system in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft that was adopted in july 2008 , after years of research into solutions . [SEP]
[CLS] as increasing numbers of " classic " 747 - 100 and 747 - 200 series aircraft have been retired , some have found their way into museums or other uses . [SEP]
[CLS] upon its retirement from service , the 747 number two in the production line was dismantled and shipped to hop ##ye ##ong , nam ##yang ##ju , g ##ye ##ong ##gi - do , south korea where it was re - assembled , rep ##aint ##ed in a livery similar to that of air force one and converted into a restaurant . [SEP]
[CLS] a former british airways 747 - 200 ##b , g - b ##d ##x ##j , is parked at the dun ##sf ##old aerodrome in surrey , england and has been used as a movie set for productions such as the 2006 james bond film , " casino royale " . [SEP]
[CLS] the plane also appears frequently in the bbc television series " top gear " , which is filmed at dun ##sf ##old . [SEP]
[CLS] the " ju ##mbo ##hos ##tel " , using a converted 747 - 200 formerly registered as 9 ##v - sq ##e , opened at ar ##landa airport , stockholm in january 2009 . [SEP]
[CLS] the wings of a 747 have been recycled as roofs of a house in malibu , california . [SEP]
[CLS] appearing in over 300 film productions the 747 is one of the most widely depicted civilian aircraft and is considered by many as one of the most iconic in film history . [SEP]
[CLS] the aircraft entered the cultural lexi ##con as the original " ju ##mbo jet " , a term coined by the aviation media to describe its size , and was also nicknamed " queen of the skies " . [SEP]
