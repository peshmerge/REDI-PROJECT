[CLS] the title is a translation into german of the old norse phrase " " , which in norse mythology refers to a prop ##hes ##ied war among various beings and gods that ultimately results in the burning , immersion in water , and renewal of the world . [SEP]
[CLS] however , as with the rest of the " ring " , wagner ' s account diver ##ges significantly from his old norse sources . [SEP]
[CLS] the three nor ##ns , daughters of er ##da , gather beside br ##un ##nh ##ilde ' s rock , weaving the rope of destiny . [SEP]
[CLS] they sing of the past and the present , and of the future when wo ##tan will set fire to val ##hall ##a to signal the end of the gods . [SEP]
[CLS] without warning , their rope breaks . [SEP]
[CLS] lame ##nting the loss of their wisdom , the nor ##ns disappear . [SEP]
[CLS] as day breaks , siegfried and br ##un ##nh ##ilde emerge from their cave , high on a mountain ##top surrounded by magic fire . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##un ##nh ##ilde sends siegfried off to new adventures , urging him to keep their love in mind . [SEP]
[CLS] as a pledge of fidelity , siegfried gives her the ring of power that he took from fa ##f ##ner ' s ho ##ard . [SEP]
[CLS] bearing br ##un ##nh ##ilde ' s shield and mounting her horse gran ##e , siegfried rides away as an orchestral interlude ( siegfried ' s journey to the rhine ) starts . [SEP]
[CLS] the act begins in the hall of the gi ##bic ##hun ##gs , a population dwelling by the rhine . [SEP]
[CLS] gunther , lord of the gi ##bic ##hun ##gs , sits en ##th ##rone ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] his half - brother and chief minister , hagen , advises him to find a wife for himself and a husband for their sister gut ##run ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] he suggests br ##un ##nh ##ilde for gunther ' s wife , and siegfried for gut ##run ##e ' s husband . [SEP]
[CLS] he reminds gut ##run ##e that he has given her a potion that she can use to make siegfried forget br ##un ##nh ##ilde and fall in love with gut ##run ##e ; under its influence , siegfried will win br ##un ##nh ##ilde for gunther . [SEP]
[CLS] gunther and gut ##run ##e agree enthusiastically with this plan . [SEP]
[CLS] siegfried appears at gi ##bic ##hun ##g hall , seeking to meet gunther . [SEP]
[CLS] gunther extends his hospitality to the hero , and gut ##run ##e offers him the love potion . [SEP]
[CLS] unaware of the deception , siegfried toast ##s br ##un ##nh ##ilde and their love . [SEP]
[CLS] drinking the potion , he loses his memory of br ##un ##nh ##ilde and falls in love with gut ##run ##e instead . [SEP]
[CLS] in his drugged state , siegfried offers to win a wife for gunther , who tells him about br ##un ##nh ##ilde and the magic fire which only a fearless person can cross . [SEP]
[CLS] they swear blood - brotherhood ( hagen holds the drinking horn in which they mix their blood , but he does not join in the oath ) and leave for br ##un ##nh ##ilde ' s rock . [SEP]
[CLS] hagen , left on guard duty , g ##lo ##ats that his so - called masters are un ##wi ##tting ##ly bringing the ring to him ( mono ##logue : hagen ' s watch ) . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , br ##un ##nh ##ilde is visited by her valkyrie sister walt ##ra ##ute , who tells her that wo ##tan returned from his wandering ##s with his spear shattered . [SEP]
[CLS] wo ##tan is dismay ##ed at losing his spear , as it has all the treaties and bargain ##s he has made — everything that gives him power — carved into its shaft . [SEP]
[CLS] wo ##tan ordered branches of the world tree , to be piled around val ##hall ##a ; sent his magic ravens to spy on the world and bring him news ; and currently waits in val ##hall ##a for the end . [SEP]
[CLS] walt ##ra ##ute begs br ##un ##nh ##ilde to return the ring to the rhine ##maid ##ens , since the ring ' s curse is now affecting their father , wo ##tan . [SEP]
[CLS] however , br ##un ##nh ##ilde refuses to re ##lin ##qui ##sh siegfried ' s token of love , and walt ##ra ##ute rides away in despair . [SEP]
[CLS] siegfried arrives , disguised as gunther by using the tar ##nh ##el ##m , and claims br ##un ##nh ##ilde as his wife . [SEP]
[CLS] though br ##un ##nh ##ilde resist ##s violently , siegfried over ##power ##s her , snatch ##ing the ring from her hand and placing it on his own . [SEP]
[CLS] hagen , waiting by the bank of the rhine , is visited in his semi - waking sleep ( sitting up , eyes open , but motionless ) by his father , al ##ber ##ich . [SEP]
[CLS] on al ##ber ##ich ' s urging , he swear ##s to kill siegfried and acquire the ring . [SEP]
[CLS] al ##ber ##ich exits as dawn breaks . [SEP]
[CLS] siegfried arrives via tar ##nh ##el ##m - magic , having resumed his natural form and left br ##un ##nh ##ilde on the boat with gunther . [SEP]
[CLS] hagen summons the gi ##bic ##hun ##g vassal ##s to welcome gunther and his bride . [SEP]
[CLS] he does this by sounding the war - alarm . [SEP]
[CLS] the vassal ##s are surprised to learn that the occasion is not battle , but their master ' s wedding and party . [SEP]
[CLS] gunther leads in a down ##cast br ##un ##nh ##ilde , who is astonished to see siegfried . [SEP]
[CLS] noticing the ring on siegfried ' s hand , she realizes she has been betrayed — that the man who conquered her was not gunther , but siegfried in disguise . [SEP]
[CLS] she den ##oun ##ces siegfried in front of gunther ' s vassal ##s and accuse ##s siegfried of having seduce ##d her himself . [SEP]
[CLS] siegfried , who does not remember ever having been br ##un ##hil ##de ' s lover , swear ##s on hagen ' s spear that her accusations are false . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##un ##nh ##ilde seize ##s the tip of the spear and swear ##s that they are true . [SEP]
[CLS] once again hagen supervise ##s silently as others take oath ##s to his advantage . [SEP]
[CLS] but this time , since the oath is sworn on a weapon , the understanding is that if the oath is proven false , the weapon ' s owner should avenge it by killing the per ##jure ##r with that weapon . [SEP]
[CLS] siegfried then leads gut ##run ##e and the by ##stand ##ers off to the wedding feast , leaving br ##un ##nh ##ilde , hagen , and gunther alone by the shore . [SEP]
[CLS] deeply shame ##d by br ##un ##nh ##ilde ' s outburst , gunther agrees to hagen ' s suggestion that siegfried must be killed in order for gunther to regain his standing . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##un ##nh ##ilde , seeking revenge for siegfried ' s manifest tre ##ache ##ry , joins the plot and tells hagen that siegfried would be vulnerable to a stab in the back . [SEP]
[CLS] hagen and gunther decide to lure siegfried on a hunting - trip and murder him . [SEP]
[CLS] they sing a trio in which br ##un ##nh ##ilde and gunther vow in the name of wo ##tan , " guardian of oath ##s " , to kill siegfried , while hagen repeats his pledge to al ##ber ##ich : to acquire the ring and rule the world through its power . [SEP]
[CLS] in the woods by the bank of the rhine , the rhine ##maid ##ens mo ##urn the lost rhine gold . [SEP]
[CLS] siegfried happens by , separated from the hunting party . [SEP]
[CLS] the rhine ##maid ##ens urge him to return the ring and avoid its curse , but he laughs at them and says he prefers to die rather than bargain for his life . [SEP]
[CLS] they swim away , predicting that siegfried will die and that his heir , a lady , will treat them more fairly . [SEP]
[CLS] siegfried rejoin ##s the hunters , who include gunther and hagen . [SEP]
[CLS] while resting , he tells them about the adventures of his youth . [SEP]
[CLS] hagen gives him another potion , which restore ##s his memory , and he tells of discovering the sleeping br ##un ##nh ##ilde and awakening her with a kiss . [SEP]
[CLS] hagen stab ##s him in the back with his spear . [SEP]
[CLS] the others look on in horror , and hagen explains in three words ( " " mein ##ei ##d ra ##cht ' ich ! " " [SEP]
[CLS] – " i have avenge ##d per ##ju ##ry ! " ) [SEP]
[CLS] that since siegfried admitted loving br ##un ##nh ##ilde , the oath he swore on hagen ' s spear was obviously false , therefore it was hagen ' s duty to kill him with it . [SEP]
[CLS] hagen calmly walks away into the wood . [SEP]
[CLS] siegfried rec ##oll ##ect ##s his awakening of br ##un ##nh ##ilde and dies . [SEP]
[CLS] his body is carried away in a solemn funeral procession ( siegfried ' s funeral march ) that forms the interlude as the scene is changed and rec ##ap ##it ##ulates many of the themes associated with siegfried and the wal ##sun ##gs . [SEP]
[CLS] back in the gi ##bic ##hun ##g hall , gut ##run ##e await ##s siegfried ' s return . [SEP]
[CLS] hagen arrives ahead of the funeral party . [SEP]
[CLS] gut ##run ##e is devastated when siegfried ' s corpse is brought in . [SEP]
[CLS] gunther blame ##s siegfried ' s death on hagen , who replies that siegfried had incurred the penalty of his false oath , and further , claims the ring on siegfried ' s finger by right of conquest . [SEP]
[CLS] when gunther objects , hagen appeals to the vassal ##s to support his claim . [SEP]
[CLS] gunther draws his sword but hagen attacks and easily kills him . [SEP]
[CLS] however , as hagen moves to take the ring , siegfried ' s hand rises threatening ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] hagen recoil ##s in fear . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##un ##nh ##ilde makes her entrance and issues orders for a huge funeral p ##yre to be assembled by the river ( the start of the im ##mo ##lation scene ) . [SEP]
[CLS] she takes the ring and tells the rhine ##maid ##ens to claim it from her ashes , once fire has clean ##sed it of its curse . [SEP]
[CLS] lighting the p ##yre with a fire ##brand , she sends wo ##tan ' s ravens home with " anxiously longed - for ti ##ding ##s " , and to fly by the magic fire for log ##e to fulfill his task . [SEP]
[CLS] after an ap ##ost ##rop ##he to the dead hero , br ##un ##nh ##ilde mounts her horse gran ##e and rides into the flames . [SEP]
[CLS] a sequence of lei ##tm ##ot ##if ##s portray the fire fl ##aring up , and the hall of the gi ##bic ##hun ##gs catching fire and collapsing . [SEP]
[CLS] the rhine over ##flow ##s its banks , que ##nch ##ing the fire , and the rhine ##maid ##ens swim in to claim the ring . [SEP]
[CLS] hagen tries to stop them but they drag him into the depths and drown him . [SEP]
[CLS] as they celebrate the return of the ring and its gold to the river , a red glow is seen in the sky . [SEP]
[CLS] as the gi ##bic ##hun ##gs watch , the interior of val ##hall ##a is finally seen , with gods and heroes visible as described by walt ##ra ##ute in act 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] flames flare up in the hall of the gods , hiding it and them from sight completely . [SEP]
[CLS] as the gods are consumed in the flames , the curtain falls to the sound of the " er ##los ##ung ##smo ##ti ##f " — the redemption lei ##tm ##ot ##if . [SEP]
[CLS] two extended orchestral selections — " dawn and siegfried ' s rhine journey " , an ab ##ridge ##d excerpt from the prologue without the singers ; and " siegfried ' s funeral march " , lifted un ##cut from act 3 — are often presented outside the opera house , and are published separately from the lengthy work . [SEP]
[CLS] early versions of these selections were approved by wagner . [SEP]
[CLS] these excerpts include specially composed endings so that the excerpt is better able to stand on its own as a complete composition . [SEP]
[CLS] according to albert sp ##eer , the berlin philharmonic ' s last performance before their evacuation from berlin at the end of world war ii in europe was of br ##un ##nh ##ilde ' s im ##mo ##lation scene at the end of the opera . [SEP]
[CLS] robert a . hall , jr . has anal ##yse ##d the opera in terms of cultural symbolism . [SEP]
[CLS] hermann dan ##user has discussed the drama ##tur ##gy of the ending of " got ##ter ##dam ##mer ##ung " in the context of the entire " ring " cycle . [SEP]
[CLS] william kind ##erman has evaluated a large - scale instance of musical rec ##ap ##it ##ulation in act iii of the opera . [SEP]
[CLS] warren j . darcy has expo ##st ##ulated on the potential influence of wagner ' s readings of the philosophy of arthur sc ##hope ##nh ##auer on the music of the " ring " cycle , particularly on the ending of " got ##ter ##dam ##mer ##ung " . [SEP]
[CLS] the historian john roberts suggested that the killing of siegfried by hagen with a stab in the back gave inspiration for the myth that the german army did not lose world war i , but was instead defeated by a treason ##ous " stab in the back " from civilians , in particular jews and socialists . [SEP]
[CLS] the great german bass kurt mo ##ll pointed out that the part of the principal villain , hagen , is unique in the bass repertoire : it requires a shouting , b ##lar ##ing vocal technique which risks damaging the singer ' s voice ; only very large - voiced , powerful singers can sing it . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##ll himself avoided the role . [SEP]
