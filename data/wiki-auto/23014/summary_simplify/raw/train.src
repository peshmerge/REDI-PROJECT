All poker variants involve betting as an intrinsic part of play, and determine the winner of each hand according to the combinations of players' cards, at least some of which remain hidden until the end of the hand.
Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt, the number of shared or "community" cards, the number of cards that remain hidden, and the betting procedures.
In most modern poker games the first round of betting begins with one or more of the players making some form of a forced bet (the "blind" or "ante").
In standard poker, each player bets according to the rank they believe their hand is worth as compared to the other players.
The action then proceeds clockwise as each player in turn must either match (or "call") the maximum previous bet, or fold, losing the amount bet so far and all further involvement in the hand.
If all but one player folds on any round, the remaining player collects the pot without being required to reveal their hand.
If more than one player remains in contention after the final betting round, a showdown takes place where the hands are revealed, and the player with the winning hand takes the pot.
With the exception of initial forced bets, money is only placed into the pot voluntarily by a player who either believes the bet has positive expected value or who is trying to bluff other players for various strategic reasons.
Thus, while the outcome of any particular hand significantly involves chance, the long-run expectations of the players are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of probability, psychology, and game theory.
In the 1937 edition of Foster's Complete Hoyle, R. F. Foster wrote: "the game of poker, as first played in the United States, five cards to each player from a twenty-card pack, is undoubtedly the Persian game of As-Nas."
By the 1990s some gaming historians including David Parlett started to challenge the notion that poker is a direct derivative of As-Nas.
Developments in the 1970s led to poker becoming far more popular than it was before.
In a casino, a house dealer handles the cards for each hand, but the button (typically a white plastic disk) is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal dealer to determine the order of betting.
The dealer shuffles the cards, the player on the chair to his or her right cuts, and the dealer deals the appropriate number of cards to the players one at a time, beginning with the player to his or her left.
Cards may be dealt either face-up or face-down, depending on the variant of poker being played.
After the initial deal, the first of what may be several betting rounds begins.
Between rounds, the players' hands develop in some way, often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt.
At the end of each round, all bets are gathered into the central pot.
At any time during a betting round, if one player bets, no opponents choose to "call" (match) the bet, and all opponents instead "fold", the hand ends immediately, the bettor is awarded the pot, no cards are required to be shown, and the next hand begins.
At the end of the last betting round, if more than one player remains, there is a showdown, in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands.
The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot.
A poker hand comprises five cards; in variants where a player has more than five cards available to them, only the best five-card combination counts.
In other words, when playing a poker variant with "low poker" the best hand is one that contains the lowest cards (and it can get further complicated by including or not including flushes and straights etc.
In no-limit poker, a player may wager their entire betting stack at any point that they are allowed to make a bet.
Video poker is a single-player video game that functions much like a slot machine; most video poker machines play draw poker, where the player bets, a hand is dealt, and the player can discard and replace cards.
Payout is dependent on the hand resulting after the draw and the player's initial bet.
Since it depends only on the basic mechanic of betting in rounds, strip poker can be played with any form of poker; however, it is usually based on simple variants with few betting rounds, like five card draw.
Another game with the "poker" name, but with a vastly different mode of play, is called "Acey-Deucey" or "Red Dog" poker.
This game is more similar to Blackjack in its layout and betting; each player bets against the house, and then is dealt two cards.
For the player to win, the third card dealt (after an opportunity to raise the bet) must have a value in-between the first two.
Payout is based on the odds that this is possible, based on the difference in values of the first two cards.
In a January 2015 article published in "Science", a group of researchers mostly from the University of Alberta announced that they "essentially weakly solved" heads-up limit "Texas Hold 'em" with their development of their Cepheus poker bot.
The authors claimed that Cepheus would lose at most 0.001 big blinds per game on average against its worst-case opponent, and the strategy is thus so "close to optimal" that "it can't be beaten with statistical significance within a lifetime of human poker playing".
Less autonomous poker programs exist whose primary purpose is not to play poker by themselves, but is instead to calculate the odds of certain hand outcomes.
