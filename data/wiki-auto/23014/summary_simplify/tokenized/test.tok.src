[CLS] all poker variants involve betting as an intrinsic part of play , and determine the winner of each hand according to the combinations of players ' cards , at least some of which remain hidden until the end of the hand . [SEP]
[CLS] poker games vary in the number of cards dealt , the number of shared or " community " cards , the number of cards that remain hidden , and the betting procedures . [SEP]
[CLS] in most modern poker games the first round of betting begins with one or more of the players making some form of a forced bet ( the " blind " or " ant ##e " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in standard poker , each player bets according to the rank they believe their hand is worth as compared to the other players . [SEP]
[CLS] the action then proceeds clockwise as each player in turn must either match ( or " call " ) the maximum previous bet , or fold , losing the amount bet so far and all further involvement in the hand . [SEP]
[CLS] if all but one player folds on any round , the remaining player collects the pot without being required to reveal their hand . [SEP]
[CLS] if more than one player remains in contention after the final betting round , a showdown takes place where the hands are revealed , and the player with the winning hand takes the pot . [SEP]
[CLS] with the exception of initial forced bets , money is only placed into the pot voluntarily by a player who either believes the bet has positive expected value or who is trying to bluff other players for various strategic reasons . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , while the outcome of any particular hand significantly involves chance , the long - run expectations of the players are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of probability , psychology , and game theory . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1937 edition of foster ' s complete ho ##yle , r . f . foster wrote : " the game of poker , as first played in the united states , five cards to each player from a twenty - card pack , is undoubtedly the persian game of as - nas . " [SEP]
[CLS] by the 1990s some gaming historians including david par ##lett started to challenge the notion that poker is a direct derivative of as - nas . [SEP]
[CLS] developments in the 1970s led to poker becoming far more popular than it was before . [SEP]
[CLS] in a casino , a house dealer handles the cards for each hand , but the button ( typically a white plastic disk ) is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal dealer to determine the order of betting . [SEP]
[CLS] the dealer shuffle ##s the cards , the player on the chair to his or her right cuts , and the dealer deals the appropriate number of cards to the players one at a time , beginning with the player to his or her left . [SEP]
[CLS] cards may be dealt either face - up or face - down , depending on the variant of poker being played . [SEP]
[CLS] after the initial deal , the first of what may be several betting rounds begins . [SEP]
[CLS] between rounds , the players ' hands develop in some way , often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of each round , all bets are gathered into the central pot . [SEP]
[CLS] at any time during a betting round , if one player bets , no opponents choose to " call " ( match ) the bet , and all opponents instead " fold " , the hand ends immediately , the bet ##tor is awarded the pot , no cards are required to be shown , and the next hand begins . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of the last betting round , if more than one player remains , there is a showdown , in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands . [SEP]
[CLS] the player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot . [SEP]
[CLS] a poker hand comprises five cards ; in variants where a player has more than five cards available to them , only the best five - card combination counts . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , when playing a poker variant with " low poker " the best hand is one that contains the lowest cards ( and it can get further complicated by including or not including flush ##es and straight ##s etc . [SEP]
[CLS] in no - limit poker , a player may wage ##r their entire betting stack at any point that they are allowed to make a bet . [SEP]
[CLS] video poker is a single - player video game that functions much like a slot machine ; most video poker machines play draw poker , where the player bets , a hand is dealt , and the player can disc ##ard and replace cards . [SEP]
[CLS] pay ##out is dependent on the hand resulting after the draw and the player ' s initial bet . [SEP]
[CLS] since it depends only on the basic mechanic of betting in rounds , strip poker can be played with any form of poker ; however , it is usually based on simple variants with few betting rounds , like five card draw . [SEP]
[CLS] another game with the " poker " name , but with a vastly different mode of play , is called " ace ##y - de ##uce ##y " or " red dog " poker . [SEP]
[CLS] this game is more similar to black ##jack in its layout and betting ; each player bets against the house , and then is dealt two cards . [SEP]
[CLS] for the player to win , the third card dealt ( after an opportunity to raise the bet ) must have a value in - between the first two . [SEP]
[CLS] pay ##out is based on the odds that this is possible , based on the difference in values of the first two cards . [SEP]
[CLS] in a january 2015 article published in " science " , a group of researchers mostly from the university of alberta announced that they " essentially weakly solved " heads - up limit " texas hold ' em " with their development of their ce ##pheus poker bot . [SEP]
[CLS] the authors claimed that ce ##pheus would lose at most 0 . 001 big blinds per game on average against its worst - case opponent , and the strategy is thus so " close to optimal " that " it can ' t be beaten with statistical significance within a lifetime of human poker playing " . [SEP]
[CLS] less autonomous poker programs exist whose primary purpose is not to play poker by themselves , but is instead to calculate the odds of certain hand outcomes . [SEP]
