poker variants involve betting as part of play , and determine the winner of each hand according to the combinations of players ' cards , at least some of which remain hidden until the end of the hand .
poker games vary in the number of cards dealt , the number of shared or community cards , the number of cards that remain hidden , and the betting procedures .
in most poker games the first round of betting begins with one or more players making some form of a " blind " or " ante " wrestler .
in poker , players make bets on the value of their poker hand .
the action then goes clockwise as each player in turn must either matchiography or " call " legally the maximum previous bet , or fold , losing the amount bet so far and all further involvement in the hand .
if all but one player folds on any round , the remaining player collects the pot without being required to reveal their hand .
if more than one player remains in contention after the final betting round , a showdown takes place where the hands are revealed , and the player with the winning hand takes the pot .
with the exception of initial forced bets , money is placed into the pot voluntarily by a player who believes the bet has positive value or who is trying to bluff other players for various reasons .
thus , while the outcome of any particular hand significantly involves chance , the long-run expectations of the players are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of probability , psychology , and game theory .
