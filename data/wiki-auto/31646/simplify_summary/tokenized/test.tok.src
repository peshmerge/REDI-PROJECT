[CLS] article one of the united states constitution establishes the legislative branch of the federal government , the united states congress . [SEP]
[CLS] under article one , congress is a bi ##cam ##eral legislature consisting of the house of representatives and the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] article one grants congress various en ##ume ##rated powers and the ability to pass laws " necessary and proper " to carry out those powers . [SEP]
[CLS] article one also establishes the procedures for passing a bill and places various limits on the powers of congress and the states . [SEP]
[CLS] article one ' s vest ##ing clause grants all federal legislative power to congress and establishes that congress consists of the house of representatives and the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] in combination with the vest ##ing clauses of the article two and article three , the vest ##ing clause of article one establishes the separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government . [SEP]
[CLS] section 2 of article one addresses the house of representatives , establishing that members of the house are elected every two years , with congressional seats app ##ort ##ioned to the states on the basis of population . [SEP]
[CLS] section 2 includes various rules for the house of representatives , including a provision stating that individuals qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of their state ' s legislature have the right to vote in elections for the house of representatives . [SEP]
[CLS] section 3 addresses the senate , establishing that the senate consists of two senators from each state , with each senator serving a six - year term . [SEP]
[CLS] section 3 originally required that the state legislatures elect the members of the senate , but the seventeenth amendment , ratified in 1913 , provides for the direct election of senators . [SEP]
[CLS] section 3 lays out various other rules for the senate , including a provision that establishes the vice president of the united states as the president of the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] section 4 of article one grants the states the power to regulate the congressional election process , but establishes that congress can alter those regulations or make its own regulations . [SEP]
[CLS] section 4 also requires congress to assemble at least once per year . [SEP]
[CLS] section 5 lays out various rules for both houses of congress , and grants the house of representatives and the senate the power to judge their own elections , determine the qualifications of their own members , and punish or ex ##pel their own members . [SEP]
[CLS] section 6 establishes the compensation , privileges , and restrictions of those holding congressional office . [SEP]
[CLS] section 7 lays out the procedures for passing a bill , requiring both houses of congress to pass a bill for it to become law , subject to the veto power of the president of the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] under section 7 , the president can veto a bill , but congress can over ##ride the president ' s veto with a two - thirds vote of both chambers . [SEP]
[CLS] section 8 lays out the powers of congress . [SEP]
[CLS] it includes several en ##ume ##rated powers , including the power to lay and collect taxes and tariffs for the " general welfare " of the united states , the power to borrow money , the power to regulate interstate and international commerce , the power to set natural ##ization laws , the power to coin and regulate money , the power to establish federal courts inferior to the supreme court , the power to raise and support military forces , and the power to declare war . [SEP]
[CLS] section 8 also provides congress the power to establish a federal district to serve as the national capital , and gives congress the exclusive power to administer that district . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to various en ##ume ##rated powers , section 8 grants congress the power to make laws necessary and proper to carry out its en ##ume ##rated powers and other powers vested in it . [SEP]
[CLS] section 9 places various limits on the power of congress , banning bills of attain ##der and other practices . [SEP]
[CLS] section 10 places limits on the states , prohibiting them from entering into alliances with foreign powers , imp ##air ##ing contracts , taxi ##ng imports or exports above the minimum level necessary for inspection , keeping armies , or engaging in war without the consent of congress . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 is a vest ##ing clause that best ##ows federal legislative power exclusively to congress . [SEP]
[CLS] similar clauses are found in articles ii and iii . [SEP]
[CLS] the former con ##fers executive power upon the president alone , and the latter grants judicial power solely to the federal judiciary . [SEP]
[CLS] these three articles create a separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government . [SEP]
[CLS] this separation of powers , by which each department may exercise only its own constitutional powers and no others , is fundamental to the idea of a limited government accountable to the people . [SEP]
[CLS] the separation of powers principle is particularly noteworthy in regard to the congress . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution declares that the congress may exercise only those legislative powers " here ##in granted " within article i ( as later limited by the tenth amendment ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it also , by implied extension , prohibits congress from del ##ega ##ting its legislative authority to either of the other branches of government , a rule known as the non ##del ##ega ##tion doctrine . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the supreme court has ruled that congress does have latitude to delegate regulatory powers to executive agencies as long as it provides an " intel ##li ##gible principle " which govern ##s the agency ' s exercise of the delegate ##d regulatory authority . [SEP]
[CLS] that the power assigned to each branch must remain with that branch , and may be expressed only by that branch , is central to the theory . [SEP]
[CLS] the non ##del ##ega ##tion doctrine is primarily used now as a way of interpreting a congressional delegation of authority narrowly , in that the courts pre ##sume congress intended only to delegate that which it certainly could have , unless it clearly demonstrates it intended to " test the waters " of what the courts would allow it to do . [SEP]
[CLS] although not specifically mentioned in the constitution , congress has also long asserted the power to investigate and the power to com ##pel cooperation with an investigation . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court has affirmed these powers as an implication of congress ' s power to leg ##is ##late . [SEP]
[CLS] since the power to investigate is an aspect of congress ' s power to leg ##is ##late , it is as broad as congress ' s powers to leg ##is ##late . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it is also " limited " to inquiries that are " in aid of the legislative function ; " congress may not " expose for the sake of exposure . " [SEP]
[CLS] it is un ##con ##tro ##vers ##ial that a proper subject of congress ' s investigation power is the operations of the federal government , but congress ' s ability to com ##pel the submission of documents or testimony from the president or his subordinate ##s is often - discussed and sometimes controversial ( see executive privilege ) , although not often lit ##igate ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] as a practical matter , the limitation of congress ' s ability to investigate only for a proper purpose ( " in aid of " its legislative powers ) functions as a limit on congress ' s ability to investigate the private affairs of individual citizens ; matters that simply demand action by another branch of government , without imp ##lica ##ting an issue of public policy nec ##ess ##itating legislation by congress , must be left to those branches due to the doctrine of separation of powers . [SEP]
[CLS] the courts are highly def ##ere ##ntial to congress ' s exercise of its investigation powers , however . [SEP]
[CLS] congress has the power to investigate that which it could regulate , and the courts have interpreted congress ' s regulatory powers broadly since the great depression . [SEP]
[CLS] section two provides for the election of the house of representatives every second year . [SEP]
[CLS] since representatives are to be " chosen . . . by the people , " state governors are not allowed to appoint temporary replacements when va ##can ##cies occur in a state ' s delegation to the house of representatives ; instead , the governor of the state is required by to issue a writ of election calling a special election to fill the vacancy . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time of its creation , the constitution did not explicitly give citizens an inherent right to vote . [SEP]
[CLS] however , by st ##ip ##ulating that those qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of a state ' s legislature could vote in congressional ( house of representatives ) elections the frame ##rs expressed a rather explicit intent that the house was to be directly elected . [SEP]
[CLS] since the civil war , several constitutional amendments have been enacted that have curb ##ed the states ' broad powers to set voter qualification standards . [SEP]
[CLS] though never enforced , clause 2 of the fourteenth amendment provides that " when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice president of the united states , representatives in congress , the executive and judicial officers of a state , or the members of the legislature thereof , is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such state , being twenty - one years of age , and citizens of the united states , or in any way ab ##ridge ##d , except for participation in rebellion , or other crime , the basis of representation there ##in shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty - one years of age in such state . " [SEP]
[CLS] the fifteenth amendment prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on race , color , or previous condition of ser ##vi ##tu ##de . [SEP]
[CLS] the nineteenth amendment prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on sex . [SEP]
[CLS] the twenty - fourth amendment prohibits the rev ##ocation of voting rights due to the non - payment of a poll tax . [SEP]
[CLS] the twenty - sixth amendment prohibits the denial of the right of us citizens , eighteen years of age or older , to vote on account of age . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , since the supreme court has recognized voting as a fundamental right , the equal protection clause places very tight limitations ( albeit with uncertain limits ) on the states ' ability to define voter qualifications ; it is fair to say that qualifications beyond citizenship , residency , and age are usually questionable . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1960s , the supreme court started to view voting as a fundamental right covered by the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment . [SEP]
[CLS] in a dissent ##ing opinion of a 1964 supreme court case involving re ##app ##ort ##ion ##ment in the alabama state legislature , associate justice john marshall harlan ii included " minor " in a list of past decisions about voting and app ##ort ##ion ##ment which were no longer being followed . [SEP]
[CLS] in " oregon v . mitchell " ( 1970 ) , the supreme court held that the qualifications clause did not prevent congress from over ##riding state - imposed minimum age restrictions for voters in congressional elections . [SEP]
[CLS] since provides that members of the house of representatives are app ##ort ##ioned state - by - state and that each state is guaranteed at least one representative , exact population equality between all districts is not guaranteed and , in fact , is currently impossible , because while the size of the house of representatives is fixed at 435 , several states had less than 1 / 435 of the national population at the time of the last re ##app ##ort ##ion ##ment in 2010 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the supreme court has interpreted the provision of clause one that representatives shall be elected " by the people " to mean that , in those states with more than one member of the house of representatives , each congressional election district within the state must have nearly identical populations . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution provides three requirements for representatives : a representative must be at least 25 years old , must be an inhabit ##ant of the state in which he or she is elected , and must have been a citizen of the united states for the previous seven years . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no requirement that a representative reside within the district in which he or she represents ; although this is usually the case , there have been occasional exceptions . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court has interpreted the qualifications clause as an " exclusive " list of qualifications that cannot be supplemented by a house of congress exercising its authority to " judge . . . the . . . qualifications of its own members " or by a state in its exercise of its authority to pre ##scribe the " times , places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives . " [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court , as well as other federal courts , have repeatedly barred states from additional restrictions , such as imposing term limits on members of congress , allowing members of congress to be subject to recall elections , or requiring that representatives live in the congressional district in which they represent . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2002 congressional research service report also found that no state could implement a qualification that a representative not be a convicted fe ##lon or incarcerated . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the united states supreme court has ruled that certain ballot access requirements , such as filing fees and submit ##ting a certain number of valid petition signatures do not constitute additional qualifications and thus few constitutional restrictions exist as to how harsh ballot access laws can be . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , although the u . s . constitution places no restrictions on state or local office - holders simultaneously holding federal office , most state constitution ##s today effectively ban state and local office holders from also holding federal office at the same time by prohibiting federal office holders from also holding state and local office . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike other state - mandated restrictions , these sort of prohibition ##s are constitutional as long they are enforced purely at the state level ( i . e . against active federal office holders seeking to obtain or hold a state or local office ) . [SEP]
[CLS] after much debate , the frame ##rs of the constitution decided to make population the basis of app ##ort ##ion ##ing the seats in the house of representatives and the tax liability among the states . [SEP]
[CLS] to facilitate this , the constitution mandates that a census be conducted every ten years to determine the population of each state and of the nation as a whole and establishes a rule for who shall be counted or excluded from the count . [SEP]
[CLS] as the new form of government would become operational prior to the completion of a national census , the constitution also provides for a temporary app ##ort ##ion ##ment of seats . [SEP]
[CLS] originally , the population of each state and of the nation as a whole was as ##cer ##tained by adding to the whole number of free persons , three - fifth ##s the number of all other persons ( i . e . slaves ) , but excluding non - tax ##ed native americans . [SEP]
[CLS] this constitutional rule , known as the three - fifth ##s compromise , was a compromise between southern and northern states in which three - fifth ##s of the population of slaves would be counted for en ##ume ##ration purposes and for the app ##ort ##ion ##ment of seats in the house of representatives and of taxes among the states . [SEP]
[CLS] it was , according to supreme court justice joseph story ( writing in 1833 ) , a " matter of compromise and concession , confessed ##ly une ##qual in its operation , but a necessary sacrifice to that spirit of con ##ci ##lia ##tion , which was ind ##is ##pen ##sable to the union of states having a great diversity of interests , and physical condition , and political institutions " . [SEP]
[CLS] following the completion of each census , congress is empowered to use the aggregate population in all the states ( according to the prevailing constitutional rule for determining population ) to determine the relative population of each state to the population of the whole , and , based on its calculations , to establish the appropriate size of the house and to all ##oca ##te a particular number of representatives to each state according to its share of the national population . [SEP]
[CLS] since enactment of the re ##app ##ort ##ion ##ment act of 1929 , a constant 435 house seats have been app ##ort ##ioned among the states according to each census , and determining the size of the house is not presently part of the app ##ort ##ion ##ment process . [SEP]
[CLS] with one exception , the app ##ort ##ion ##ment of 1842 , the house of representatives had been enlarged by various degrees from sixty - five members in 1788 to 435 members by 1913 . [SEP]
[CLS] the determination of size was made based on the aggregate national population , so long as the size of the house did not exceed 1 member for every 30 , 000 of the country ' s total population nor the size of any state ' s delegation exceed 1 for every 30 , 000 of that state ' s population . [SEP]
[CLS] with the size of the house still fixed at 435 , the current ratio , as of the 2010 census , is around 1 representative : 700 , 000 persons . [SEP]
[CLS] although the first sentence in this clause originally concerned app ##ort ##ion ##ment of both house seats and taxes among the several states , the fourteenth amendment sentence that replaced it in 1868 mentioned only the app ##ort ##ion ##ment of house seats . [SEP]
[CLS] even so , the constraint placed upon congress ' s taxation power remained , as the restriction was reiterated in article 1 section 9 clause 4 . [SEP]
[CLS] the amount of direct taxes that could be collected by the federal government from the people in any state would still be tied directly to that state ' s share of the national population . [SEP]
[CLS] due to this restriction , application of the income tax to income derived from real estate and specifically income in the form of divide ##nds from personal property ownership such as stock shares was found to be unconstitutional because it was not app ##ort ##ioned among the states ; that is to say , there was no guarantee that a state with 10 % of the country ' s population paid 10 % of those income taxes collected , because congress had not fixed an amount of money to be raised and app ##ort ##ioned it between the states according to their respective shares of the national population . [SEP]
[CLS] to permit the levy ##ing of such an income tax , congress proposed and the states ratified the sixteenth amendment , which removed the restriction by specifically providing that congress could levy a tax on income " from whatever source derived " without it being app ##ort ##ioned among the states or otherwise based on a state ' s share of the national population . [SEP]
[CLS] section two , clause four , provides that when va ##can ##cies occur in the house of representatives , it is not the job of the house of representatives to arrange for a replacement , but the job of the state whose vacant seat is up for ref ##ill ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , the state governor may not appoint a temporary replacement , but must instead arrange for a special election to fill the vacancy . [SEP]
[CLS] the original qualifications and procedures for holding that election are still valid . [SEP]
[CLS] section two further provides that the house of representatives may choose its speaker and its other officers . [SEP]
[CLS] though the constitution does not mandate it , every speaker has been a member of the house of representatives . [SEP]
[CLS] the speaker rarely pre ##side ##s over routine house sessions , choosing instead to de ##put ##ize a junior member to accomplish the task . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , section two grants to the house of representatives the sole power of imp ##ea ##chment . [SEP]
[CLS] although the supreme court has not had an occasion to interpret this specific provision , the court has suggested that the grant to the house of the " " sole " " power of imp ##ea ##chment makes the house the exclusive interpreter of what constitutes an imp ##ea ##cha ##ble offense . [SEP]
[CLS] this power , which is analogous to the bringing of criminal charges by a grand jury , has been used only rarely . [SEP]
[CLS] the house has begun imp ##ea ##chment proceedings 62 times since 1789 , and nineteen federal officials have been formally imp ##ea ##ched as a result , including : two presidents ( andrew johnson and bill clinton ) , one cabinet secretary ( william w . bel ##k ##na ##p ) , one senator ( william b ##lou ##nt ) , one supreme court associate justice ( samuel chase ) , and fourteen federal judges . [SEP]
[CLS] also , notably , imp ##ea ##chment proceedings compelled the resignation of president richard nixon . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution does not specify how imp ##ea ##chment proceedings are to be initiated . [SEP]
[CLS] until the early 20th century , a house member could rise and propose an imp ##ea ##chment , which would then be assigned to a committee for investigation . [SEP]
[CLS] presently , it is the house judiciary committee that initiate ##s the process and then , after investigating the allegations , prepares recommendations for the whole house ' s consideration . [SEP]
[CLS] if the house votes to adopt an imp ##ea ##chment resolution , the chairman of the judiciary committee recommends a slate of " managers , " whom the house subsequently approve ##s by resolution . [SEP]
[CLS] these representatives subsequently become the prosecution team in the imp ##ea ##chment trial in the senate ( see section 3 , clause 6 below ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the first clause of section three provides that each state is entitled to have two senators , who would be elected by its state legislature ( now by the people of each state ) , serve for staggered six - year terms , and have one vote each . [SEP]
[CLS] by these provisions , the frame ##rs of the constitution intended to protect the interests of the states as states . [SEP]
[CLS] this clause has been superseded by the seventeenth amendment , ratified in 1913 , which , in part , provides " as amended " , that [SEP]
[CLS] article five specifies the means by which the constitution of the united states can be amended . [SEP]
[CLS] it ends by temporarily shielding three article i clauses from being amended . [SEP]
[CLS] this clause is among them . [SEP]
[CLS] ( the others are first and fourth clauses in section 9 . ) [SEP]
[CLS] article five provides that " no state , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate . " [SEP]
[CLS] thus , no individual state may have its individual representation in the senate adjusted without its consent . [SEP]
[CLS] that is to say , an amendment that changed this clause to provide that all states would get only one senator ( or three senators , or any other number ) could become valid as part of the constitution if ratified by three - fourth ##s of the states ; however , one that provided for some basis of representation other than strict numerical equality ( for example , population , wealth , or land area ) , would require the unanimous consent of all the states . [SEP]
[CLS] denying the states their intended role as joint partners in the federal government by ab ##olis ##hing their equality in the senate would , according to chief justice salmon p . chase ( in " texas v . white " ) , destroy the ground ##ing of the union . [SEP]
[CLS] this article v provision has been employed by those opposed to contemplated constitutional amendments that would grant the district of columbia full representation in the congress without also granting it statehood . [SEP]
[CLS] their argument is that an amendment that would allow a non - state district to have two senators would de ##pr ##ive the states of their equal suffrage in the senate and would therefore require unanimous ratification by all the states . those in favor of the amendment have argued that the states are merely entitled to equal suffrage amongst one another , and that granting the federal district senate representation does not violate that right . [SEP]
[CLS] whether unanimous consent of the 50 states would be required for such an amendment to become operative remains an una ##ns ##wer ##ed political question . [SEP]
[CLS] after the first group of senators was elected to the first congress ( 1789 – 1791 ) , the senators were divided into three " classes " as nearly equal in size as possible , as required by this section . [SEP]
[CLS] this was done in may 1789 by lot . [SEP]
[CLS] it was also decided that each state ' s senators would be assigned to two different classes . [SEP]
[CLS] those senators grouped in the first class had their term ex ##pire after only two years ; those senators in the second class had their term ex ##pire after only four years , instead of six . [SEP]
[CLS] after this , all senators from those states have been elected to six - year terms , and as new states have joined the union , their senate seats have been assigned to two of the three classes , maintaining each grouping as nearly equal in size as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] in this way , election is staggered ; approximately one - third of the senate is up for re - election every two years , but the entire body is never up for re - election in the same year ( as contrasted with the house , where its entire membership is up for re - election every 2 years ) . [SEP]
[CLS] as originally established , senators were elected by the legislature of the state they represented in the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] if a senator died , resigned , or was expelled , the legislature of the state would appoint a replacement to serve out the remainder of the senator ' s term . [SEP]
[CLS] if the state legislature was not in session , its governor could appoint a temporary replacement to serve until the legislature could elect a permanent replacement . [SEP]
[CLS] this was superseded by the seventeenth amendment , which provided for the popular election of senators , instead of their appointment by the state legislature . [SEP]
[CLS] in a nod to the less pop ##uli ##st nature of the senate , the amendment tracks the vacancy procedures for the house of representatives in requiring that the governor call a special election to fill the vacancy , but ( unlike in the house ) it vest ##s in the state legislature the authority to allow the governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election is held . [SEP]
[CLS] note , however , that under the original constitution , the governors of the states were express ##ly allowed by the constitution to make temporary appointments . [SEP]
[CLS] the current system , under the seventeenth amendment , allows governors to appoint a replacement only if their state legislature has previously decided to allow the governor to do so ; otherwise , the seat must remain vacant until the special election is held to fill the seat , as in the case of a vacancy in the house . [SEP]
[CLS] a senator must be at least 30 years of age , must have been a citizen of the united states for at least nine years before being elected , and must reside in the state they will represent at the time of the election . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court has interpreted the qualifications clause as an exclusive list of qualifications that cannot be supplemented by a house of congress exercising its authority to " judge . . . the . . . qualifications of its own members , " or by a state in its exercise of its authority to pre ##scribe the " times , places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives . . . " [SEP]
[CLS] section three provides that the vice president is the president of the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] except ##ing the duty to receive the tally of electoral votes for president , this is the only regular responsibility assigned to the office of the vice president by the constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] when serving in this capacity , the vice president , who is not a member of the senate , may cast tie - breaking votes . [SEP]
[CLS] early in the nation ' s history , vice presidents frequently presided over the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] in modern times , the vice president usually does so only during ceremonial occasions or when a tie in the voting is anticipated . [SEP]
[CLS] through december 21 , 2018 , a tie - breaking vote has been cast 268 times [SEP]
[CLS] clause five provides for a president pro tempo ##re of the senate , a senator elected to the post by the senate , to pre ##side over the body when the vice president is either absent or exercising the office of the president . [SEP]
[CLS] although the constitutional text seems to suggest to the contrary , the senate ' s current practice is to elect a full - time president pro tempo ##re at the beginning of each congress , as opposed to making it a temporary office only existing during the vice president ' s absence . [SEP]
[CLS] since world war ii , the senior ( longest serving ) member of the majority party has filled this position . [SEP]
[CLS] as is true of the speaker of the house , the constitution does not require that the president pro tempo ##re be a senator , but by convention , a senator is always chosen . [SEP]
[CLS] clause six grants to the senate the sole power to try imp ##ea ##chment ##s and spells out the basic procedures for imp ##ea ##chment trials . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court has interpreted this clause to mean that the senate has exclusive and un ##re ##view ##able authority to determine what constitutes an adequate imp ##ea ##chment trial . [SEP]
[CLS] of the nineteen federal officials formally imp ##ea ##ched by the house of representatives , eleven were acquitted and seven were convicted by the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] on one occasion ( in the case of senator william b ##lou ##nt ) the senate declined to hold a trial , asserting that it had no jurisdiction over its own members . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution ' s frame ##rs vested the senate with this power for several reasons . [SEP]
[CLS] first , they believed senators would be better educated , more vi ##rt ##uous , and more high - minded than members of the house of representatives and thus uniquely able to decide res ##pon ##si ##bly the most difficult of political questions . [SEP]
[CLS] second , they believed that the senate , being a numerous body , would be well suited to handle the procedural demands of an imp ##ea ##chment trial , in which it , unlike judges and the judiciary system , would " never be tied down by such strict rules , either in the del ##ine ##ation of the offense by the prosecutor , or in the construction of it by judges , as in the common cases serve to limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal security . " [SEP]
[CLS] ( alexander hamilton , the federal ##ist no . 65 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there are three constitutional ##ly mandated requirements for imp ##ea ##chment trials . [SEP]
[CLS] the provision that senators must sit on oath or af ##firm ##ation was designed to impress upon them the extreme seriousness of the occasion . [SEP]
[CLS] the st ##ip ##ulation that the chief justice is to pre ##side over presidential imp ##ea ##chment trials under ##sco ##res the solemn ##ity of the occasion and aims to avoid the conflict of interest of a vice president ' s presiding over the proceeding for the removal of the one official standing between him ( or her ) and the presidency . [SEP]
[CLS] the latter consideration was regarded to be quite important in the eighteenth century - political parties had not yet formed when the constitution was adopted , and with the original method of elect ##ing the president and vice president it was presumed that the two men elected to those offices would frequently be political rivals . [SEP]
[CLS] the specification that a two - thirds super - majority vote of those senators present in order to convict was also thought necessary to facilitate serious del ##ibe ##ration and to make removal possible only through a consensus that cuts across faction ##al divisions . [SEP]
[CLS] if any officer is convicted on imp ##ea ##chment , he or she is immediately removed from office , and may be barred from holding any public office in the future . [SEP]
[CLS] no other punishments may be inflicted pursuant to the imp ##ea ##chment proceeding , but the convicted party remains liable to trial and punishment in the courts for civil and criminal charges . [SEP]
[CLS] the purpose of this clause is two ##fold . [SEP]
[CLS] first , it makes clear the division of responsibility with respect to the conduct of the election of federal senators and representatives . [SEP]
[CLS] that responsibility lies primarily with the states and second ##ari ##ly with congress . [SEP]
[CLS] second , the clause lodges the power to regulate elections in the respective legislative branches of the states and the federal government , not with the executive or judicial . [SEP]
[CLS] as authorized by this clause , congress has set a uniform date for federal elections : the tuesday following the first monday in november . [SEP]
[CLS] presently , as there are no on - point federal regulations , the states retain the authority to regulate the dates on which other aspects of the election process are held ( registration , primary elections , etc . ) and where elections will be held . [SEP]
[CLS] as for regulating the " manner " of elections , the supreme court has interpreted this to mean " matters like notices , registration , supervision of voting , protection of voters , prevention of fraud and corrupt practices , counting of votes , duties of inspectors and canvas ##ser ##s , and making and publication of election returns . " [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court has held that states may " not " exercise their power to determine the " manner " of holding elections to impose term limits on their congressional delegation . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the most significant ways that each state regulates the " manner " of elections is through their power to draw electoral districts . [SEP]
[CLS] although in theory congress could draw the district map for each state , it has not exercised this level of oversight . [SEP]
[CLS] congress has , however , required the states to conform to certain practices when drawing districts . [SEP]
[CLS] states are currently required to use a single - member district scheme , whereby the state is divided into as many election districts for representatives in the house of representatives as the size of its representation in that body ( that is to say , representatives cannot be elected at - large from the whole state unless the state has only one representative in the house , nor can districts elect more than 1 representative ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court has interpreted " by the legislature thereof " to include voters using the initiative process , in those states whose constitution ##s provide it , to create an independent red ##ist ##ricting commission . [SEP]
[CLS] congress first exercised its power to regulate elections nation - wide 1842 , when the 27th congress passed a law requiring the election of representatives by districts . [SEP]
[CLS] in subsequent years , congress expanded on the requirements , successively adding con ##ti ##gui ##ty , compact ##ness , and substantial equality of population to the district ##ing requirements . [SEP]
[CLS] these standards were all later deleted in the re ##app ##ort ##ion ##ment act of 1929 . [SEP]
[CLS] congress subsequently reinstated the requirement that districts be composed of contiguous territory , be " compact , " and have equal populations within each state . [SEP]
[CLS] congress has allowed those requirements to laps ##e , but the supreme court has re - imposed the population requirement on the states under the equal protection clause and is suspicious of districts that do not meet the other " traditional " district ##ing criteria of compact ##ness and con ##ti ##gui ##ty . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1865 , congress leg ##is ##lated a remedy for a situation under which dead ##lock ##s in state legislatures over the election of senators were creating va ##can ##cies in the office . [SEP]
[CLS] the act required the two houses of each legislature to meet in joint session on a specified day and to meet every day thereafter until a senator was selected . [SEP]
[CLS] the first comprehensive federal statute dealing with elections was adopted in 1870 as a means of enforcing the fifteenth amendment ’ s guarantee against racial discrimination in granting suffrage rights . [SEP]
[CLS] under the enforcement act of 1870 , and subsequent laws , false registration , bribery , voting without legal right , making false returns of votes cast , interference in any manner with officers of election , and the neglect by any such officer of any duty required by state or federal law were made federal offenses . [SEP]
[CLS] provision was made for the appointment by federal judges of persons to attend at places of registration and at elections with authority to challenge any person proposing to register or vote unlawful ##ly , to witness the counting of votes , and to identify by their signatures the registration of voters and election tally sheets . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning with the till ##man act of 1907 , congress has imposed a growing number of restrictions on elections and campaign financing . [SEP]
[CLS] the most significant piece of legislation has been the 1971 federal election campaign act . [SEP]
[CLS] it was this legislation that was at issue in the supreme court ' s seminal decision , " buckley v . vale ##o " ( 1976 ) , which , in the face of a first amendment challenge , set the ground rules for campaign finance legislation , generally di ##sal ##low ##ing restrictions on expenditures by candidates , but permitting restrictions on contributions by individuals and corporations . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to statutory constraints , congress and the states have altered the electoral process through amend ##ing the constitution ( first in the above mentioned fifteenth amendment ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the seventeenth amendment altered the manner of conducting the elections of senators ; establishing that they are to be elected by the people of the states . [SEP]
[CLS] also , the nineteenth amendment prohibits any u . s . citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis of sex ; the twenty - fourth amendment prohibits both congress and the states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a poll tax or other types of tax ; and the twenty - sixth amendment prohibits the states and the federal government from using age as a reason for denying the right to vote to u . s . citizens who are at least eighteen years old . [SEP]
[CLS] clause 2 fix ##es an annual date upon which congress must meet . [SEP]
[CLS] by doing so , the constitution em ##power ##s congress to meet , whether or not the president called it into session . [SEP]
[CLS] does grant the president limited authority to con ##ven ##e and ad ##jou ##rn both houses ( or either of them ) and mandates that it will meet at least once in a year to en ##act legislation on behalf of the people . [SEP]
[CLS] some delegates to the 1787 constitutional convention believed yearly meetings were not necessary , for there would not be enough legislative business for congress to deal with annually . [SEP]
[CLS] nathaniel go ##rh ##am of massachusetts argued that the time should be fixed to prevent disputes from arising within the legislature , and to allow the states to adjust their elections to correspond with the fixed date . [SEP]
[CLS] a fixed date also corresponded to the tradition in the states of having annual meetings . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , go ##rh ##am concluded that the legislative branch should be required to meet at least once a year to act as a check upon the executive department . [SEP]
[CLS] although this clause provides that the annual meeting was to be on the first monday in december , the government established by the 1787 constitution did not begin operations until march 4 , 1789 . [SEP]
[CLS] as the 1st congress held its initial meeting on march 4 , that became the date on which new representatives and senators took office in subsequent years . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , every other year , although a new congress was elected in november , it did not come into office until the following march , with a " lame duck " session con ##ven ##ing in the interim . [SEP]
[CLS] this practice was altered in 1933 following ratification of the twentieth amendment , which states ( in section 2 ) that , " the congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall begin at noon on the third day of january , unless they shall by law appoint a different day " . [SEP]
[CLS] this change virtually eliminated the necessity of there being a lame duck session of congress . [SEP]
[CLS] section five states that a majority of each house constitutes a quo ##rum to do business ; a smaller number may ad ##jou ##rn the house or com ##pel the attendance of absent members . [SEP]
[CLS] in practice , the quo ##rum requirement is all but ignored . [SEP]
[CLS] a quo ##rum is assumed to be present unless a quo ##rum call , requested by a member , proves otherwise . [SEP]
[CLS] rarely do members ask for quo ##rum calls to demonstrate the absence of a quo ##rum ; more often , they use the quo ##rum call as a delaying tactic . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes , un ##qual ##ified individuals have been admitted to congress . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , the senate once admitted john henry eaton , a twenty - eight - year - old , in 1818 ( the admission was ina ##d ##vert ##ent , as eaton ' s birth date was unclear at the time ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1934 , a twenty - nine - year - old , rush holt , was elected to the senate ; he agreed to wait six months , until his th ##ir ##tie ##th birthday , to take the oath . [SEP]
[CLS] the senate ruled in that case that the age requirement applied as of the date of the taking of the oath , not the date of election . [SEP]
[CLS] each house can determine its own rules ( assuming a quo ##rum is present ) , and may punish any of its members . [SEP]
[CLS] a two - thirds vote is necessary to ex ##pel a member . [SEP]
[CLS] section 5 , clause 2 does not provide specific guidance to each house regarding when and how each house may change its rules , leaving details to the respective chambers . [SEP]
[CLS] each house must keep and publish a journal , though it may choose to keep any part of the journal secret . [SEP]
[CLS] the decisions of the house — not the words spoken during debates — are recorded in the journal ; if one - fifth of those present ( assuming a quo ##rum is present ) request it , the votes of the members on a particular question must also be entered . [SEP]
[CLS] neither house may ad ##jou ##rn , without the consent of the other , for more than three days . [SEP]
[CLS] often , a house will hold " pro form ##a " sessions every three days ; such sessions are merely held to fulfill the constitutional requirement , and not to conduct business . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , neither house may meet in any place other than that designated for both houses ( the capitol ) , without the consent of the other house . [SEP]
[CLS] senators and representatives set their own compensation . [SEP]
[CLS] under the twenty - seventh amendment , any change in their compensation will not take effect until after the next congressional election . [SEP]
[CLS] paying senators and representatives out of the federal treasury was a departure from the practice under the articles of confederation , where they were paid by the state they were elected . [SEP]
[CLS] members of both houses have certain privileges , based on those enjoyed by the members of the british parliament . [SEP]
[CLS] members attending , going to or returning from either house are privileged from arrest , except for treason , felony or breach of the peace . [SEP]
[CLS] one may not sue a senator or representative for sl ##ander occurring during congressional debate , nor may speech by a member of congress during a congressional session be the basis for criminal prosecution . [SEP]
[CLS] the latter was affirmed when mike gravel published over 4 , 000 pages of the pentagon papers in the congressional record , which might have otherwise been a criminal offense . [SEP]
[CLS] this clause has also been interpreted in " gravel v . united states " , 40 ##8 u . s . 60 ##6 ( 1972 ) to provide protection to aide ##s and staff of sitting members of congress , so long as their activities relate to legislative matters . [SEP]
[CLS] senators and representatives may not simultaneously serve in congress and hold a position in the executive branch . [SEP]
[CLS] this restriction is meant to protect legislative independence by preventing the president from using patronage to buy votes in congress . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a major difference from the political system in the british parliament , where cabinet ministers are required to be members of parliament . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , senators and representatives cannot resign to take newly created or higher - paying political positions ; rather , they must wait until the conclusion of the term for which they were elected . [SEP]
[CLS] if congress increases the salary of a particular officer , it may later reduce that salary to permit an individual to resign from congress and take that position ( known as the sax ##be fix ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the effects of the clause were discussed in 1937 , when senator hugo black was appointed an associate justice of the supreme court with some time left in his senate term . [SEP]
[CLS] just prior to the appointment , congress had increased the pension available to justices retiring at the age of seventy . [SEP]
[CLS] it was therefore suggested by some that the office ' s em ##ol ##umen ##t had been increased during black ' s senator ##ial term , and that therefore black could not take office as a justice . [SEP]
[CLS] the response , however , was that black was fifty - one years old , and would not receive the increased pension until at least 19 years later , long after his senate term had expired . [SEP]
[CLS] this establishes the method for making acts of congress that involve taxation . [SEP]
[CLS] accordingly , any bill may originate in either house of congress , except for a revenue bill , which may originate only in the house of representatives . [SEP]
[CLS] in practice , the senate sometimes ci ##rc ##um ##vent ##s this requirement by sub ##stituting the text of a revenue bill previously passed by the house with a substitute text . [SEP]
[CLS] either house may amend any bill , including revenue and app ##ropriation bills . [SEP]
[CLS] this clause of the u . s . constitution stemmed from an english parliamentary practice that all money bills must have their first reading in the house of commons . [SEP]
[CLS] this practice was intended to ensure that the power of the purse is possessed by the legislative body most responsive to the people , although the english practice was modified in america by allowing the senate to amend these bills . [SEP]
[CLS] the clause was part of the great compromise between small and large states ; the large states were unhappy with the lo ##ps ##ided power of small states in the senate , and so the clause theoretically offset ##s the un ##re ##pres ##ent ##ative nature of the senate , and compensate ##s the large states for allowing equal voting rights to senators from small states . [SEP]
[CLS] this clause is known as the present ##ment clause . [SEP]
[CLS] before a bill becomes law , it must be presented to the president , who has ten days ( excluding sundays ) to act upon it . [SEP]
[CLS] if the president signs the bill , it becomes law . [SEP]
[CLS] if he di ##sa ##pp ##rove ##s of the bill , he must return it to the house in which it originated together with his objections . [SEP]
[CLS] this procedure has become known as the veto , although that particular word does not appear in the text of article one . [SEP]
[CLS] the bill does not then become law unless both houses , by two - thirds votes , over ##ride the veto . [SEP]
[CLS] if the president neither signs nor returns the bill within the ten - day limit , the bill becomes law , unless the congress has ad ##jou ##rned in the meantime , thereby preventing the president from returning the bill to the house in which it originated . [SEP]
[CLS] in the latter case , the president , by taking no action on the bill towards the end of a session , exercises a " pocket veto " , which congress may not over ##ride . [SEP]
[CLS] in the former case , where the president allows a bill to become law unsigned , there is no common name for the practice , but recent scholarship has termed it a " default enactment . " [SEP]
[CLS] what exactly constitutes an ad ##jou ##rn ##ment for the purposes of the pocket veto has been unclear . [SEP]
[CLS] in the " pocket veto case " ( 1929 ) , the supreme court held that " the deter ##mina ##tive question in reference to an ' ad ##jou ##rn ##ment ' is not whether it is a final ad ##jou ##rn ##ment of congress or an interim ad ##jou ##rn ##ment , such as an ad ##jou ##rn ##ment of the first session , but whether it is one that ' prevents ' the president from returning the bill to the house in which it originated within the time allowed . " [SEP]
[CLS] since neither house of congress was in session , the president could not return the bill to one of them , thereby permitting the use of the pocket veto . [SEP]
[CLS] in " wright v . united states " ( 1938 ) , however , the court ruled that ad ##jou ##rn ##ments of one house only did not constitute an ad ##jou ##rn ##ment of congress required for a pocket veto . [SEP]
[CLS] in such cases , the secretary or clerk of the house in question was ruled competent to receive the bill . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1996 , congress passed the line item veto act , which permitted the president , at the time of the signing of the bill , to res ##cin ##d certain expenditures . [SEP]
[CLS] the congress could di ##sa ##pp ##rove the cancellation and reins ##tate the funds . [SEP]
[CLS] the president could veto the disapproval , but the congress , by a two - thirds vote in each house , could over ##ride the veto . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case " clinton v . city of new york " , the supreme court found the line item veto act unconstitutional because it violated the present ##ment clause . [SEP]
[CLS] first , the procedure delegate ##d legislative powers to the president , thereby violating the non ##del ##ega ##tion doctrine . [SEP]
[CLS] second , the procedure violated the terms of section seven , which state , " if he approve the bill he shall sign it , but if not he shall return it . " [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the president may sign the bill , veto it , or do nothing , but he may not amend the bill and then sign it . [SEP]
[CLS] every bill , order , resolution , or vote that must be passed by both houses , except on a question of ad ##jou ##rn ##ment , must be presented to the president before becoming law . [SEP]
[CLS] however , to propose a constitutional amendment , two - thirds of both houses may submit it to the states for the ratification , without any consideration by the president , as prescribed in article v . [SEP]
[CLS] some presidents have made very extensive use of the veto , while others have not used it at all . [SEP]
[CLS] grover cleveland , for instance , veto ##ed over four hundred bills during his first term in office ; congress over ##rod ##e only two of those veto ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , seven presidents have never used the veto power . [SEP]
[CLS] there have been 2 , 560 veto ##es , including pocket veto ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] many powers of congress have been interpreted broadly . [SEP]
[CLS] most notably , the taxi ##ng and spending , interstate commerce , and necessary and proper clauses have been deemed to grant expansive powers to congress . [SEP]
[CLS] congress may lay and collect taxes for the " common defense " or " general welfare " of the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] the u . s . supreme court has not often defined " general welfare , " leaving the political question to congress . [SEP]
[CLS] in " united states v . butler " ( 1936 ) , the court for the first time con ##st ##rued the clause . [SEP]
[CLS] the dispute centered on a tax collected from processors of agricultural products such as meat ; the funds raised by the tax were not paid into the general funds of the treasury , but were rather specially ear ##mark ##ed for farmers . [SEP]
[CLS] the court struck down the tax , ruling that the general welfare language in the taxi ##ng and spending clause related only to " matters of national , as distinguished from local , welfare " . [SEP]
[CLS] congress continues to make expansive use of the taxi ##ng and spending clause ; for instance , the social security program is authorized under the taxi ##ng and spending clause . [SEP]
[CLS] congress has the power to borrow money on the credit of the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1871 , when deciding " knox v . lee , " the court ruled that this clause permitted congress to emi ##t bills and make them legal tender in satisfaction of debts . [SEP]
[CLS] whenever congress borrow ##s money , it is ob ##liga ##ted to repay the sum as stipulated in the original agreement . [SEP]
[CLS] however , such agreements are only " binding on the conscience of the sovereign " , as the doctrine of sovereign immunity prevents a credit ##or from sui ##ng in court if the government rene ##ges on its commitment . [SEP]
[CLS] the necessary and proper clause , as well as the commerce and general welfare clauses have been interpreted so broadly that to this day , the federal government of the united states exercises many powers that are not express ##ly delegate ##d by the states in the federal government by the constitution , like the different social programs of the american welfare state . [SEP]
[CLS] however , james madison , who wrote much of the constitution , disagreed that congress exercises powers that are not express ##ly granted in the constitution ; madison , when he held the office of president of the united states , exercised his veto power against the federal public works bill of 1817 , calling it unconstitutional , since to him , the federal government does not have the power to build infrastructure . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court has seldom restrained the use of the " commerce clause " for widely varying purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] the first important decision related to the commerce clause was " gibbons v . ogden " , decided by a unanimous court in 1824 . [SEP]
[CLS] the case involved conflicting federal and state laws : thomas gibbons had a federal permit to navigate steamboat ##s in the hudson river , while the other , aaron ogden , had a monopoly to do the same granted by the state of new york . [SEP]
[CLS] ogden contend ##ed that " commerce " included only buying and selling of goods and not their transportation . [SEP]
[CLS] chief justice john marshall rejected this notion . [SEP]
[CLS] marshall suggested that " commerce " included navigation of goods , and that it " must have been contemplated " by the frame ##rs . [SEP]
[CLS] marshall added that congress ' s power over commerce " is complete in itself , may be exercised to its utmost extent , and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the constitution " . [SEP]
[CLS] the expansive interpretation of the commerce clause was restrained during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , when a " lai ##sse ##z - fair ##e " attitude dominated the court . [SEP]
[CLS] in " united states v . e . c . knight company " ( 1895 ) , the supreme court limited the newly enacted sherman anti ##trust act , which had sought to break up the mono ##pol ##ies dominating the nation ' s economy . [SEP]
[CLS] the court ruled that congress could not regulate the manufacture of goods , even if they were later shipped to other states . [SEP]
[CLS] chief justice melville fuller wrote , " commerce succeeds to manufacture , and is not a part of it . " [SEP]
[CLS] the u . s . supreme court sometimes ruled new deal programs unconstitutional because they stretched the meaning of the commerce clause . [SEP]
[CLS] in " sc ##he ##cht ##er poultry corp . v . united states , " ( 1935 ) the court unanimously struck down industrial codes regulating the slaughter of poultry , declaring that congress could not regulate commerce relating to the poultry , which had " come to a permanent rest within the state . " [SEP]
[CLS] as chief justice charles evans hughes put it , " so far as the poultry here in question is concerned , the flow of interstate commerce has ceased . " [SEP]
[CLS] judicial ruling ##s against attempted use of congress ' s commerce clause powers continued during the 1930s . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1937 , the supreme court began moving away from its lai ##sse ##z - fair ##e attitude concerning congressional legislation and the commerce clause , when it ruled in " national labor relations board v . jones & laugh ##lin steel company " , that the national labor relations act of 1935 ( commonly known as the wagner act ) was constitutional . [SEP]
[CLS] the legislation under scrutiny prevented employers from engaging in " unfair labor practices " such as firing workers for joining unions . [SEP]
[CLS] in sustaining this act , the court , signaled its return to the philosophy es ##po ##used by john marshall , that congress could pass laws regulating actions that even indirectly influenced interstate commerce . [SEP]
[CLS] this new attitude became firmly set into place in 1942 . [SEP]
[CLS] in " wi ##ck ##ard v . fi ##lb ##urn " , the court ruled that production quota ##s under the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 were constitutional ##ly applied to agricultural production ( in this instance , home - grown wheat for private consumption ) that was consumed purely intra ##sta ##te , because its effect upon interstate commerce placed it within the power of congress to regulate under the commerce clause . [SEP]
[CLS] this decision marked the beginning of the court ' s total def ##erence to congress ' claims of commerce clause powers , which lasted into the 1990s . [SEP]
[CLS] " united states v . lopez " ( 1995 ) was the first decision in six decades to invalid ##ate a federal statute on the grounds that it exceeded the power of the congress under the commerce clause . [SEP]
[CLS] the court held that while congress had broad law ##making authority under the commerce clause , the power was limited , and did not extend so far from " commerce " as to author ##ize the regulation of the carrying of handgun ##s , especially when there was no evidence that carrying them affected the economy on a massive scale . [SEP]
[CLS] in a later case , " united states v . morrison " ( 2000 ) , the justices ruled that congress could not make such laws even when there was evidence of aggregate effect . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast to these ruling ##s , the supreme court also continues to follow the precedent set by " wi ##ck ##ard v . fi ##lb ##urn " . [SEP]
[CLS] in " gonzales v . rai ##ch " it ruled that the commerce clause granted congress the authority to criminal ##ize the production and use of home - grown cannabis even where states approve its use for medicinal purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] the court held that , as with the agricultural production in the earlier case , home - grown cannabis is a legitimate subject of federal regulation because it competes with marijuana that moves in interstate commerce . [SEP]
[CLS] congress may establish uniform laws relating to natural ##ization and bankruptcy . [SEP]
[CLS] it may also coin money , regulate the value of american or foreign currency and punish counter ##feit ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] congress may fix the standards of weights and measures . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , congress may establish post offices and post roads ( the roads , however , need not be exclusively for the convey ##ance of mail ) . [SEP]
[CLS] congress may promote the progress of science and useful arts by granting copyright ##s and patents of limited duration . [SEP]
[CLS] section eight , clause eight of article one , known as the copyright clause , is the only instance of the word " right " used in the original constitution ( though the word does appear in several amendments ) . [SEP]
[CLS] though perpetual copyright ##s and patents are prohibited , the supreme court has ruled in " el ##dre ##d v . ash ##croft " ( 2003 ) that repeated extensions to the term of copyright do not constitute perpetual copyright ; also note that this is the only power granted where the means to accomplish its stated purpose is specifically provided for . [SEP]
[CLS] courts inferior to the supreme court may be established by congress . [SEP]
[CLS] congress has several powers related to war and the armed forces . [SEP]
[CLS] under the war powers clause , only congress may declare war , but in several cases it has , without declaring war , granted the president the authority to engage in military conflicts . [SEP]
[CLS] five wars have been declared in united states ' history : the war of 1812 , the mexican – american war , the spanish – american war , world war i and world war ii . [SEP]
[CLS] some historians argue that the legal doctrines and legislation passed during the operations against pan ##cho villa constitute a sixth declaration of war . [SEP]
[CLS] congress may grant letters of mar ##que and rep ##ris ##al . [SEP]
[CLS] congress may establish and support the armed forces , but no app ##ropriation made for the support of the army may be used for more than two years . [SEP]
[CLS] this provision was inserted because the frame ##rs feared the establishment of a standing army , beyond civilian control , during peace ##time . [SEP]
[CLS] congress may regulate or call forth the state militias , but the states retain the authority to appoint officers and train personnel . [SEP]
[CLS] congress also has exclusive power to make rules and regulations governing the land and naval forces . [SEP]
[CLS] although the executive branch and the pentagon have asserted an ever - increasing measure of involvement in this process , the u . s . supreme court has often re ##af ##firmed congress ' s exclusive hold on this power ( e . g . burns v . wilson , 34 ##6 u . s . 137 ( 1953 ) ) . [SEP]
[CLS] congress used this power twice soon after world war ii with the enactment of two statutes : the uniform code of military justice to improve the quality and fairness of courts martial and military justice , and the federal tor ##t claims act which among other rights had allowed military service persons to sue for damages until the u . s . supreme court repealed that section of the statute in a di ##vis ##ive series of cases , known collectively as the fe ##res doctrine . [SEP]
[CLS] congress has the exclusive right to leg ##is ##late " in all cases whatsoever " for the nation ' s capital , the district of columbia . [SEP]
[CLS] congress chooses to dev ##ol ##ve some of such authority to the elected mayor and council of district of columbia . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , congress remains free to en ##act any legislation for the district so long as constitutional ##ly per ##missible , to over ##turn any legislation by the city government , and technically to rev ##oke the city government at any time . [SEP]
[CLS] congress may also exercise such jurisdiction over land purchased from the states for the erection of forts and other buildings . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , congress has the power to do whatever is " necessary and proper " to carry out its en ##ume ##rated powers and , crucial ##ly , all others vested in it . [SEP]
[CLS] this has been interpreted to author ##ize criminal prosecution of those whose actions have a " substantial effect " on interstate commerce in " wi ##ck ##ard v . fi ##lb ##urn " ; however , thomas jefferson , in the kentucky resolutions , supported by james madison , maintained that a penal power could not be in ##fer ##red from a power to regulate , and that the only penal powers were for treason , counter ##feit ##ing , piracy and felony on the high seas , and offenses against the law of nations . [SEP]
[CLS] the necessary and proper clause has been interpreted extremely broadly , thereby giving congress wide latitude in legislation . [SEP]
[CLS] the first landmark case involving the clause was " mcc ##ull ##och v . maryland " ( 1819 ) , which involved the establishment of a national bank . [SEP]
[CLS] alexander hamilton , in advocating the creation of the bank , argued that there was " a more or less direct " relationship between the bank and " the powers of collecting taxes , borrowing money , regulating trade between the states , and raising and maintaining fleets and na ##vies " . [SEP]
[CLS] thomas jefferson countered that congress ' s powers " can all be carried into execution without a national bank . [SEP]
[CLS] a bank therefore is not necessary , and consequently not authorized by this phrase " . [SEP]
[CLS] chief justice john marshall agreed with the former interpretation . [SEP]
[CLS] marshall wrote that a constitution listing " all " of congress ' s powers " would part ##ake of a pro ##li ##xi ##ty of a legal code and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind " . [SEP]
[CLS] since the constitution could not possibly en ##ume ##rate the " minor ingredients " of the powers of congress , marshall " de ##duced " that congress had the authority to establish a bank from the " great outlines " of the general welfare , commerce and other clauses . [SEP]
[CLS] under this doctrine of the necessary and proper clause , congress has sweeping ##ly broad powers ( known as implied powers ) not explicitly en ##ume ##rated in the constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the congress cannot en ##act laws solely on the implied powers , any action must be necessary and proper in the execution of the en ##ume ##rated powers . [SEP]
[CLS] the first clause in this section prevents congress from passing any law that would restrict the import ##ation of slaves into the united states prior to 1808 . [SEP]
[CLS] congress could however , levy a " per capita " duty of up to ten spanish mill ##ed dollars for each slave imported into the country . [SEP]
[CLS] this clause was further en ##tre ##nched into the constitution by article v , where it is explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808 . [SEP]
[CLS] on march 2 , 1807 , congress approved legislation prohibiting the import ##ation of slaves into the united states , which went into effect january 1 , 1808 , the first day permitted by the constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] a writ of " ha ##be ##as corpus " is a legal action against unlawful det ##ain ##ment that commands a law enforcement agency or other body that has a person in custody to have a court in ##qui ##re into the legal ##ity of the detention . [SEP]
[CLS] the court may order the person released if the reason for detention is deemed insufficient or un ##just ##if ##iable . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution further provides that the privilege of the writ of " ha ##be ##as corpus " may not be suspended " unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it " . [SEP]
[CLS] in " ex part ##e mill ##igan " ( 1866 ) , the supreme court ruled that the suspension of " ha ##be ##as corpus " in a time of war was lawful , but military tribunal ##s did not apply to citizens in states that had upheld the authority of the constitution and where civilian courts were still operating . [SEP]
[CLS] a bill of attain ##der is a law by which a person is immediately convicted without trial . [SEP]
[CLS] an " ex post facto " law is a law which applies retro ##active ##ly , punish ##ing someone for an act that was only made criminal after it was done . [SEP]
[CLS] the " ex post facto " clause does not apply to civil matters . [SEP]
[CLS] section nine rei ##tera ##tes the provision from that direct taxes must be app ##ort ##ioned by state populations . [SEP]
[CLS] this clause was also explicitly shielded from constitutional amendment prior to 1808 by article v . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1913 , the 16th amendment exempt ##ed all income taxes from this clause . [SEP]
[CLS] this overcame the ruling in pollock v . farmers ' loan & trust co . that the income tax could only be applied to regular income and could not be applied to divide ##nds and capital gains . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , no tax may be imposed on exports from any state . [SEP]
[CLS] congress may not , by revenue or commerce legislation , give preference to ports of one state over those of another ; neither may it require ships from one state to pay duties in another . [SEP]
[CLS] all funds belonging to the treasury may not be withdrawn except according to law . [SEP]
[CLS] modern practice is that congress annually passes a number of appropriations bills author ##izing the expenditure of public money . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution requires that a regular statement of such expenditures be published . [SEP]
[CLS] the title of nobility clause prohibits congress from granting any title of nobility . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , it specifies that no civil officer may accept , without the consent of congress , any gift , payment , office or title from a foreign ruler or state . [SEP]
[CLS] em ##ol ##umen ##ts were a profound concern of the founders . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a u . s . citizen may receive foreign office before or after their period of public service . [SEP]
[CLS] states may not exercise certain powers reserved for the federal government : they may not enter into treaties , alliances or confederation ##s , grant letters of mar ##que or rep ##ris ##al , coin money or issue bills of credit ( such as currency ) . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , no state may make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts , which express ##ly forbid ##s any state government ( but not the federal government ) from " making a tender " ( i . e . , author ##izing something that may be offered in payment ) of any type or form of money to meet any financial obligation , unless that form of money is coins made of gold or silver ( or a medium of exchange backed by and red ##eem ##able in gold or silver coins , as noted in " farmers & merchants bank v . federal reserve bank " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] much of this clause is devoted to preventing the states from using or creating any currency other than that created by congress . [SEP]
[CLS] in " federal ##ist no . 44 " , madison explains that " it may be observed that the same reasons which she ##w the necessity of denying to the states the power of regulating coin , prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin . [SEP]
[CLS] had every state a right to regulate the value of its coin , there might be as many different cu ##rre ##ncies as states ; and thus the intercourse among them would be imp ##eded " . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , the states may not pass bills of attain ##der , en ##act " ex post facto " laws , imp ##air the obligation of contracts , or grant titles of nobility . [SEP]
[CLS] the contract clause was the subject of much contentious litigation in the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] it was first interpreted by the supreme court in 1810 , when " fletcher v . peck " was decided . [SEP]
[CLS] the case involved the ya ##zoo land scandal , in which the georgia legislature authorized the sale of land to spec ##ulator ##s at low prices . [SEP]
[CLS] the bribery involved in the passage of the author ##izing legislation was so b ##lat ##ant that a georgia mob attempted to lynch the corrupt members of the legislature . [SEP]
[CLS] following elections , the legislature passed a law that res ##cin ##ded the contracts granted by the corrupt legislators . [SEP]
[CLS] the validity of the ann ##ul ##ment of the sale was questioned in the supreme court . [SEP]
[CLS] in writing for a unanimous court , chief justice john marshall asked , " what is a contract ? " [SEP]
[CLS] his answer was : " a compact between two or more parties " . [SEP]
[CLS] marshall argued that the sale of land by the georgia legislature , though fra ##ught with corruption , was a valid " contract " . [SEP]
[CLS] he added that the state had no right to ann ##ul the purchase of the land , since doing so would imp ##air the obligations of contract . [SEP]
[CLS] the definition of a contract prop ##ounded by chief justice marshall was not as simple as it may seem . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1819 , the court considered whether a corporate charter could be con ##st ##rued as a contract . [SEP]
[CLS] the case of " trustees of dartmouth college v . woodward " involved dartmouth college , which had been established under a royal charter granted by king george iii . [SEP]
[CLS] the charter created a board of twelve trustees for the governance of the college . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1815 , however , new hampshire passed a law increasing the board ' s membership to twenty - one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the college . [SEP]
[CLS] the court , including marshall , ruled that new hampshire could not amend the charter , which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred " vested rights " on the trustees . [SEP]
[CLS] the marshall court determined another dispute in " stu ##rge ##s v . crown ##ins ##hi ##eld " . [SEP]
[CLS] the case involved a debt that was contracted in early 1811 . [SEP]
[CLS] later in that year , the state of new york passed a bankruptcy law , under which the debt was later discharged . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court ruled that a retro ##active ##ly applied state bankruptcy law impaired the obligation to pay the debt , and therefore violated the constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] in " ogden v . saunders " ( 1827 ) , however , the court decided that state bankruptcy laws " could " apply to debts contracted after the passage of the law . [SEP]
[CLS] state legislation on the issue of bankruptcy and debt ##or relief has not been much of an issue since the adoption of a comprehensive federal bankruptcy law in 1898 . [SEP]
[CLS] still more powers are prohibited of the states . [SEP]
[CLS] states may not , without the consent of congress , tax imports or exports except for the fulfillment of state inspection laws ( which may be revised by congress ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the net revenue of the tax is paid not to the state , but to the federal treasury . [SEP]
[CLS] under the compact clause , states may not , without the consent of congress , keep troops or armies during times of peace . [SEP]
[CLS] they may not enter into alliances nor compact ##s with foreign states , nor engage in war unless invaded . [SEP]
[CLS] states may , however , organize and arm a militia according to the discipline prescribed by congress . [SEP]
[CLS] ( article i , section 8 , en ##ume ##rated powers of congress . ) [SEP]
[CLS] the national guard , whose members are also members of the militia of the united states as defined by / 311 § 311 , fulfill this function , as do persons serving in state militias with federal oversight under / 109 § 109 . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea of allowing congress to have say over agreements between states traces back to the numerous controversies that arose between various colonies . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually compromise ##s would be created between the two colonies and these compromise ##s would be submitted to the crown for approval . [SEP]
[CLS] after the american revolutionary war , the articles of confederation allowed states to appeal to congress to settle disputes between the states over boundaries or " any cause whatever " . [SEP]
[CLS] the articles of confederation also required congressional approval for " any treaty or alliance " in which a state was one of the parties . [SEP]
[CLS] there have been a number of supreme court cases concerning what constitutes valid congressional consent to an interstate compact . [SEP]
[CLS] in " virginia v . tennessee " , 148 u . s . 50 ##3 ( 1893 ) , the court found that some agreements among states stand even when lacking the explicit consent of congress . [SEP]
[CLS] ( one example the court gave was a state moving some goods from a distant state to itself , it would not require congressional approval to contract with another state to use its canals for transport . ) [SEP]
[CLS] according to the court , the compact clause requires congressional consent only if the agreement among the states is " directed to the formation of any combination tending to the increase of political power in the states , which may en ##cr ##oa ##ch upon or interfere with the just supremacy of the united states " . [SEP]
[CLS] the congressional consent issue is at the center of the current debate over the constitutional ##ity of the not yet effective national popular vote interstate compact entered into by fifteen states plus the district of columbia . [SEP]
