He is generally considered to be one of the greatest English composers; no later native-born English composer approached his fame until Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, William Walton and Benjamin Britten in the 20th century.
Henry Purcell Senior, whose older brother, Thomas Purcell, (died 1682) was a musician, was a gentleman of the Chapel Royal and sang at the coronation of King Charles II of England.
Daniel Purcell, the youngest of the brothers, was also a prolific composer who wrote the music for much of the final act of "The Indian Queen" after Henry Purcell's death.
After his father's death in 1664, Purcell was placed under the guardianship of his uncle Thomas, who showed him great affection and kindness.
Thomas was himself a gentleman of His Majesty's Chapel, and arranged for Henry to be admitted as a chorister.
The composer Matthew Locke was a family friend and, particularly with his semi-operas, probably also had a musical influence on the young Purcell.
Henry was a chorister in the Chapel Royal until his voice broke in 1673, when he became assistant to the organ-builder John Hingston, who held the post of keeper of wind instruments to the King.
Purcell is said to have been composing at nine years old, but the earliest work that can be certainly identified as his is an ode for the King's birthday, written in 1670.
It is assumed that the three-part song "Sweet tyranness, I now resign" was written by him as a child.
From an extant letter written by Thomas Purcell we learn that this anthem was composed for the exceptionally fine voice of the Rev.
John Gostling, then at Canterbury, but afterwards a gentleman of His Majesty's Chapel.
Purcell wrote several anthems at different times for Gostling's extraordinary basso profondo voice, which is known to have had a range of at least two full octaves, from D below the bass staff to the D above it.
In gratitude for the providential escape of King Charles II from shipwreck, Gostling, who had been of the royal party, put together some verses from the Psalms in the form of an anthem and requested Purcell to set them to music.
In 1679, Blow, who had been appointed organist of Westminster Abbey 10 years before, resigned his office in favour of Purcell.
Purcell now devoted himself almost entirely to the composition of sacred music, and for six years severed his connection with the theatre.
However, during the early part of the year, probably before taking up his new office, he had produced two important works for the stage, the music for Nathaniel Lee's "Theodosius", and Thomas d'Urfey's "Virtuous Wife".
The composition of his chamber opera "Dido and Aeneas", which forms a very important landmark in the history of English dramatic music, has been attributed to this period, and its earliest production may well have predated the documented one of 1689.
It was written to a libretto furnished by Nahum Tate, and performed in 1689 in cooperation with Josias Priest, a dancing master and the choreographer for the Dorset Garden Theatre.
It is occasionally considered the first genuine English opera, though that title is usually given to Blow's "Venus and Adonis": as in Blow's work, the action does not progress in spoken dialogue but in Italian-style recitative.
At the time, "Dido and Aeneas" never found its way to the theatre, though it appears to have been very popular in private circles.
It is believed to have been extensively copied, but only one song was printed by Purcell's widow in "Orpheus Britannicus", and the complete work remained in manuscript until 1840, when it was printed by the Musical Antiquarian Society under the editorship of Sir George Macfarren.
The composition of "Dido and Aeneas" gave Purcell his first chance to write a sustained musical setting of a dramatic text.
The story of "Dido and Aeneas" derives from the original source in Virgil's epic the "Aeneid".
Soon after Purcell's marriage, in 1682, on the death of Edward Lowe, he was appointed organist of the Chapel Royal, an office which he was able to hold simultaneously with his position at Westminster Abbey.
For some years after this, he was busy in the production of sacred music, odes addressed to the king and royal family, and other similar works.
In 1690 he composed a setting of the birthday ode for Queen Mary, "Arise, my muse" and four years later wrote one of his most elaborate, important and magnificent works â€“ a setting for another birthday ode for the Queen, written by Nahum Tate, entitled "Come Ye Sons of Art".
In this year, Purcell also composed a march and passepied called "Quick-step", which became so popular that Lord Wharton adapted the latter to the fatal verses of "Lillibullero"; and in or before January 1688, Purcell composed his anthem "Blessed are they that fear the Lord" by express command of the King.
In 1692, he composed "The Fairy-Queen" (an adaptation of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream"), the score of which (his longest for theatre) was rediscovered in 1901 and published by the Purcell Society.
"The Indian Queen" followed in 1695, in which year he also wrote songs for Dryden and Davenant's version of Shakespeare's "The Tempest" (recently, this has been disputed by music scholars), probably including "Full fathom five" and "Come unto these yellow sands".
In these semi-operas (another term for which at the time was "dramatic opera"), the main characters of the plays do not sing but speak their lines: the action moves in dialogue rather than recitative.
The related songs are sung "for" them by singers, who have minor dramatic roles.
Purcell's "Te Deum" and "Jubilate Deo" were written for Saint Cecilia's Day, 1694, the first English "Te Deum" ever composed with orchestral accompaniment.
This work was annually performed at St Paul's Cathedral until 1712, after which it was performed alternately with Handel's "Utrecht Te Deum and Jubilate" until 1743, when both works were replaced by Handel's "Dettingen Te Deum".
He composed an anthem and two elegies for Queen Mary II's funeral, his "Funeral Sentences and Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary".
Besides the operas and semi-operas already mentioned, Purcell wrote the music and songs for Thomas d'Urfey's "The Comical History of Don Quixote", "Bonduca", "The Indian Queen" and others, a vast quantity of sacred music, and numerous odes, cantatas, and other miscellaneous pieces.
The quantity of his instrumental chamber music is minimal after his early career, and his keyboard music consists of an even more minimal number of harpsichord suites and organ pieces.
The music that he had earlier composed for Queen Mary's funeral was performed during his funeral as well.
His wife Frances died in 1706, having published a number of her husband's works, including the now famous collection called "Orpheus Britannicus", in two volumes, printed in 1698 and 1702, respectively.
Purcell worked in many genres, both in works closely linked to the court, such as symphony song, to the Chapel Royal, such as the symphony anthem, and the theatre.
After his death, Purcell was honoured by many of his contemporaries, including his old friend John Blow, who wrote "An Ode, on the Death of Mr. Henry Purcell (Mark how the lark and linnet sing)" with text by his old collaborator, John Dryden.
William Croft's 1724 setting for the Burial Service, was written in the style of "the great Master".
Croft preserved Purcell's setting of "Thou knowest Lord" (Z 58) in his service, for reasons "obvious to any artist"; it has been sung at every British state funeral ever since.
More recently, the English poet Gerard Manley Hopkins wrote a famous sonnet entitled simply "Henry Purcell", with a headnote reading: "The poet wishes well to the divine genius of Purcell and praises him that, whereas other musicians have given utterance to the moods of man's mind, he has, beyond that, uttered in notes the very make and species of man as created both in him and in all men generally."
Purcell also had a strong influence on the composers of the English musical renaissance of the early 20th century, most notably Benjamin Britten, who created and performed a realisation of "Dido and Aeneas" and whose "The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra" is based on a theme from Purcell's "Abdelazar".
Stylistically, the aria "I know a bank" from Britten's opera "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is clearly inspired by Purcell's aria "Sweeter than Roses", which Purcell originally wrote as part of incidental music to Richard Norton's "Pausanias, the Betrayer of His Country".
Purcell is honoured together with Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA) on 28 July.
In a 1940 interview Ignaz Friedman stated that he considered Purcell as great as Bach and Beethoven.
Purcell's works have been catalogued by Franklin Zimmerman, who gave them a number preceded by Z.
The so-called "Purcell's Trumpet Voluntary" was in fact written around 1700 by a British composer named Jeremiah Clarke as the "Prince of Denmark's March".
In 2009 Pete Townshend of The Who, an English rock band that established itself in the 1960s, identified Purcell's harmonies, particularly the use of suspension and resolution that Townshend had learned from producer Kit Lambert, as an influence on the band's music (in songs such as "Won't Get Fooled Again" (1971), "I Can See for Miles" (1967) and the very Purcellian intro to "Pinball Wizard").
Purcell's music was widely featured as background music in the Academy Award winning 1979 film "Kramer vs. Kramer" with the soundtrack being released by CBS Masterworks Records
In the 21st century, the soundtrack of the 2005 film version of "Pride and Prejudice" features a dance titled "A Postcard to Henry Purcell".
In the German-language 2004 movie, "Downfall", the music of Dido's Lament is used repeatedly as the end of the Third Reich culminates.
The 2012 film "Moonrise Kingdom" contains Benjamin Britten's version of the Rondeau in Purcell's "Abdelazar" created for his 1946 "The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra".
In 2013, the Pet Shop Boys released their single "Love Is a Bourgeois Construct" incorporating one of the same ground basses from "King Arthur" used by Nyman in his "Draughtsman's Contract" score.
