[CLS] he is generally considered to be one of the greatest english composers ; no later native - born english composer approached his fame until edward el ##gar , ralph vaughan williams , william walton and benjamin britten in the 20th century . [SEP]
[CLS] henry purcell senior , whose older brother , thomas purcell , ( died 1682 ) was a musician , was a gentleman of the chapel royal and sang at the coronation of king charles ii of england . [SEP]
[CLS] daniel purcell , the youngest of the brothers , was also a prolific composer who wrote the music for much of the final act of " the indian queen " after henry purcell ' s death . [SEP]
[CLS] after his father ' s death in 1664 , purcell was placed under the guardians ##hip of his uncle thomas , who showed him great affection and kindness . [SEP]
[CLS] thomas was himself a gentleman of his majesty ' s chapel , and arranged for henry to be admitted as a cho ##rist ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] the composer matthew locke was a family friend and , particularly with his semi - operas , probably also had a musical influence on the young purcell . [SEP]
[CLS] henry was a cho ##rist ##er in the chapel royal until his voice broke in 167 ##3 , when he became assistant to the organ - builder john hi ##ng ##ston , who held the post of keeper of wind instruments to the king . [SEP]
[CLS] purcell is said to have been composing at nine years old , but the earliest work that can be certainly identified as his is an ode for the king ' s birthday , written in 1670 . [SEP]
[CLS] it is assumed that the three - part song " sweet ty ##ran ##ness , i now resign " was written by him as a child . [SEP]
[CLS] from an extant letter written by thomas purcell we learn that this anthem was composed for the exceptionally fine voice of the rev . [SEP]
[CLS] john go ##st ##ling , then at canterbury , but afterwards a gentleman of his majesty ' s chapel . [SEP]
[CLS] purcell wrote several anthem ##s at different times for go ##st ##ling ' s extraordinary bass ##o prof ##ond ##o voice , which is known to have had a range of at least two full octave ##s , from d below the bass staff to the d above it . [SEP]
[CLS] in gratitude for the provide ##ntial escape of king charles ii from ship ##wr ##eck , go ##st ##ling , who had been of the royal party , put together some verses from the psalms in the form of an anthem and requested purcell to set them to music . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1679 , blow , who had been appointed organist of westminster abbey 10 years before , resigned his office in favour of purcell . [SEP]
[CLS] purcell now devoted himself almost entirely to the composition of sacred music , and for six years severed his connection with the theatre . [SEP]
[CLS] however , during the early part of the year , probably before taking up his new office , he had produced two important works for the stage , the music for nathaniel lee ' s " theo ##dos ##ius " , and thomas d ' ur ##fe ##y ' s " vi ##rt ##uous wife " . [SEP]
[CLS] the composition of his chamber opera " did ##o and ae ##neas " , which forms a very important landmark in the history of english dramatic music , has been attributed to this period , and its earliest production may well have pre ##date ##d the documented one of 1689 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was written to a libretto furnished by nah ##um tate , and performed in 1689 in cooperation with jo ##sia ##s priest , a dancing master and the choreographer for the dorset garden theatre . [SEP]
[CLS] it is occasionally considered the first genuine english opera , though that title is usually given to blow ' s " venus and ad ##onis " : as in blow ' s work , the action does not progress in spoken dialogue but in italian - style rec ##itative . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time , " did ##o and ae ##neas " never found its way to the theatre , though it appears to have been very popular in private circles . [SEP]
[CLS] it is believed to have been extensively copied , but only one song was printed by purcell ' s widow in " or ##pheus brit ##ann ##icus " , and the complete work remained in manuscript until 1840 , when it was printed by the musical anti ##qua ##rian society under the editors ##hip of sir george mac ##far ##ren . [SEP]
[CLS] the composition of " did ##o and ae ##neas " gave purcell his first chance to write a sustained musical setting of a dramatic text . [SEP]
[CLS] the story of " did ##o and ae ##neas " derives from the original source in virgil ' s epic the " ae ##ne ##id " . [SEP]
[CLS] soon after purcell ' s marriage , in 1682 , on the death of edward lowe , he was appointed organist of the chapel royal , an office which he was able to hold simultaneously with his position at westminster abbey . [SEP]
[CLS] for some years after this , he was busy in the production of sacred music , ode ##s addressed to the king and royal family , and other similar works . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1690 he composed a setting of the birthday ode for queen mary , " arise , my muse " and four years later wrote one of his most elaborate , important and magnificent works â€“ a setting for another birthday ode for the queen , written by nah ##um tate , entitled " come ye sons of art " . [SEP]
[CLS] in this year , purcell also composed a march and pass ##ep ##ied called " quick - step " , which became so popular that lord wharton adapted the latter to the fatal verses of " lil ##lib ##ull ##ero " ; and in or before january 1688 , purcell composed his anthem " blessed are they that fear the lord " by express command of the king . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1692 , he composed " the fairy - queen " ( an adaptation of shakespeare ' s " a midsummer night ' s dream " ) , the score of which ( his longest for theatre ) was rediscovered in 1901 and published by the purcell society . [SEP]
[CLS] " the indian queen " followed in 1695 , in which year he also wrote songs for dry ##den and dave ##nant ' s version of shakespeare ' s " the tempest " ( recently , this has been disputed by music scholars ) , probably including " full fat ##hom five " and " come unto these yellow sands " . [SEP]
[CLS] in these semi - operas ( another term for which at the time was " dramatic opera " ) , the main characters of the plays do not sing but speak their lines : the action moves in dialogue rather than rec ##itative . [SEP]
[CLS] the related songs are sung " for " them by singers , who have minor dramatic roles . [SEP]
[CLS] purcell ' s " te de ##um " and " ju ##bil ##ate de ##o " were written for saint cecilia ' s day , 169 ##4 , the first english " te de ##um " ever composed with orchestral accompaniment . [SEP]
[CLS] this work was annually performed at st paul ' s cathedral until 1712 , after which it was performed alternately with handel ' s " utrecht te de ##um and ju ##bil ##ate " until 1743 , when both works were replaced by handel ' s " det ##ting ##en te de ##um " . [SEP]
[CLS] he composed an anthem and two el ##eg ##ies for queen mary ii ' s funeral , his " funeral sentences and music for the funeral of queen mary " . [SEP]
[CLS] besides the operas and semi - operas already mentioned , purcell wrote the music and songs for thomas d ' ur ##fe ##y ' s " the comical history of don qui ##x ##ote " , " bond ##uca " , " the indian queen " and others , a vast quantity of sacred music , and numerous ode ##s , cantata ##s , and other miscellaneous pieces . [SEP]
[CLS] the quantity of his instrumental chamber music is minimal after his early career , and his keyboard music consists of an even more minimal number of harpsichord suites and organ pieces . [SEP]
[CLS] the music that he had earlier composed for queen mary ' s funeral was performed during his funeral as well . [SEP]
[CLS] his wife frances died in 170 ##6 , having published a number of her husband ' s works , including the now famous collection called " or ##pheus brit ##ann ##icus " , in two volumes , printed in 169 ##8 and 1702 , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] purcell worked in many genres , both in works closely linked to the court , such as symphony song , to the chapel royal , such as the symphony anthem , and the theatre . [SEP]
[CLS] after his death , purcell was honoured by many of his contemporaries , including his old friend john blow , who wrote " an ode , on the death of mr . henry purcell ( mark how the lark and lin ##net sing ) " with text by his old collaborator , john dry ##den . [SEP]
[CLS] william croft ' s 1724 setting for the burial service , was written in the style of " the great master " . [SEP]
[CLS] croft preserved purcell ' s setting of " thou know ##est lord " ( z 58 ) in his service , for reasons " obvious to any artist " ; it has been sung at every british state funeral ever since . [SEP]
[CLS] more recently , the english poet gerard man ##ley hopkins wrote a famous son ##net entitled simply " henry purcell " , with a head ##note reading : " the poet wishes well to the divine genius of purcell and praises him that , whereas other musicians have given utter ##ance to the moods of man ' s mind , he has , beyond that , uttered in notes the very make and species of man as created both in him and in all men generally . " [SEP]
[CLS] purcell also had a strong influence on the composers of the english musical renaissance of the early 20th century , most notably benjamin britten , who created and performed a real ##isation of " did ##o and ae ##neas " and whose " the young person ' s guide to the orchestra " is based on a theme from purcell ' s " abd ##ela ##zar " . [SEP]
[CLS] stylistic ##ally , the aria " i know a bank " from britten ' s opera " a midsummer night ' s dream " is clearly inspired by purcell ' s aria " sweet ##er than roses " , which purcell originally wrote as part of incident ##al music to richard norton ' s " pau ##san ##ias , the betray ##er of his country " . [SEP]
[CLS] purcell is honoured together with johann sebastian bach and george fr ##ider ##ic handel with a feast day on the liturgical calendar of the episcopal church ( usa ) on 28 july . [SEP]
[CLS] in a 1940 interview ign ##az friedman stated that he considered purcell as great as bach and beethoven . [SEP]
[CLS] purcell ' s works have been catalogue ##d by franklin zimmerman , who gave them a number preceded by z . [SEP]
[CLS] the so - called " purcell ' s trumpet voluntary " was in fact written around 1700 by a british composer named jeremiah clarke as the " prince of denmark ' s march " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2009 pete towns ##hend of the who , an english rock band that established itself in the 1960s , identified purcell ' s harmonies , particularly the use of suspension and resolution that towns ##hend had learned from producer kit lambert , as an influence on the band ' s music ( in songs such as " won ' t get fooled again " ( 1971 ) , " i can see for miles " ( 1967 ) and the very purcell ##ian intro to " pin ##ball wizard " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] purcell ' s music was widely featured as background music in the academy award winning 1979 film " kramer vs . kramer " with the soundtrack being released by cbs master ##works records [SEP]
[CLS] in the 21st century , the soundtrack of the 2005 film version of " pride and prejudice " features a dance titled " a post ##card to henry purcell " . [SEP]
[CLS] in the german - language 2004 movie , " downfall " , the music of did ##o ' s lame ##nt is used repeatedly as the end of the third reich cu ##lm ##inates . [SEP]
[CLS] the 2012 film " moon ##rise kingdom " contains benjamin britten ' s version of the ron ##de ##au in purcell ' s " abd ##ela ##zar " created for his 1946 " the young person ' s guide to the orchestra " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2013 , the pet shop boys released their single " love is a bourgeois construct " incorporating one of the same ground bass ##es from " king arthur " used by ny ##man in his " draught ##sman ' s contract " score . [SEP]
