in 1046 , henry took the role of popes benedict ix and sylvester iii , and accepted the resignation of pope benedict ix .
henry suggested suidger for pope , and he was elected , taking the name of clement ii .
clement then proceeded with the coronation of henry as holy roman emperor .
clement 's brief tenure as pope was the enactment of more stringent prohibitions against simony .
in the autumn of 1046 , there were three rival claimants to the papacy , in st . peter 's , the lateran , and st . mary major 's .
benedict ix and sylvester iii represented rival factions of the nobility .
the third , pope gregory vi , in order to free the city from the house of tusculum , had paid benedict money in exchange for his resignation .
even though the money was given , simony was not well .
the legitimacy of any of them could undermine the validity of a coronation of henry as holy roman emperor .
henry crossed the alps at the head of a large army .
in 1046 , he went with king henry i of italy and in december , he took part in the council of sutri .
king henry nominated suidger for the papacy and the council elected him .
suidger had to keep the bishopric of his see , partly for financial support , and partly lest the romans should before long send him back to bamberg .
clement 's election was later criticized by the reform party within the papal curia due to the royal involvement and the fact that the new pope was already bishop of another diocese .
he gave the title of a roman patricius , a dignity which was commonly understood to give the bearer the right of indicating the person to be chosen pope .
clement ii 's short pontificate , starting with the roman synod of 1047 , started an improvement in the state of affairs within the roman church , particularly by making decrees against simony .
clement and the emperor went through southern italy .
scientists studied his remains in the mid-20th century .
