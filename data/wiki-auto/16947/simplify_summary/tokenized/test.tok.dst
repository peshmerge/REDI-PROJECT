[CLS] ke ##rber ##os is a computer - network authentication protocol that works on the basis of " tickets " to allow nodes communicating over a non - secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner . [SEP]
[CLS] the protocol was named after the character " ke ##rber ##os " ( or " ce ##rber ##us " ) from greek mythology , the ferocious three - headed guard dog of hades . [SEP]
[CLS] its designers aimed it primarily at a client – server model and it provides mutual authentication — both the user and the server verify each other ' s identity . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rber ##os protocol messages are protected against ea ##ves ##drop ##ping and replay attacks . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rber ##os builds on symmetric key crypt ##ography and requires a trusted third party , and optional ##ly may use public - key crypt ##ography during certain phases of authentication . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rber ##os uses ud ##p port 88 by default . [SEP]
[CLS] massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) developed ke ##rber ##os to protect network services provided by project athena . [SEP]
[CLS] the protocol is based on the earlier need ##ham – sc ##hr ##oed ##er symmetric key protocol . [SEP]
[CLS] several versions of the protocol exist ; versions 1 – 3 occurred only internally at mit . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rber ##os version 4 was primarily designed by steve miller and clifford ne ##uman . [SEP]
[CLS] published in the late 1980s , version 4 was also targeted at project athena . [SEP]
[CLS] ne ##uman and ko ##hl published version 5 in 1993 with the intention of overcoming existing limitations and security problems . [SEP]
[CLS] version 5 appeared as rfc 151 ##0 , and was made obsolete by rfc 412 ##0 in 2005 . [SEP]
[CLS] authorities in the united states classified ke ##rber ##os as " auxiliary military equipment " on the us munitions list and banned its export because it used the data encryption standard ( des ) encryption algorithm ( with 56 - bit keys ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a non - us ke ##rber ##os 4 implementation , k ##th - k ##rb developed at the royal institute of technology in sweden , made the system available outside the us before the us changed its crypt ##ography export regulations ( " circa " 2000 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the swedish implementation was based on a limited version called e ##bone ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##bone ##s was based on the exported mit bones release ( stripped of both the encryption functions and the calls to them ) based on version ke ##rber ##os 4 patch - level 9 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2005 , the internet engineering task force ( ie ##tf ) ke ##rber ##os working group updated specifications . [SEP]
[CLS] mit makes an implementation of ke ##rber ##os freely available , under copyright permission ##s similar to those used for bs ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2007 , mit formed the ke ##rber ##os consortium to foster continued development . [SEP]
[CLS] founding sponsors include vendors such as oracle , apple inc . , google , microsoft , cent ##ri ##fy corporation and team ##f ##1 inc . , and academic institutions such as the royal institute of technology in sweden , stanford university , mit , and vendors such as cyber ##sa ##fe offering commercially supported versions . [SEP]
[CLS] windows 2000 and later versions use ke ##rber ##os as its default authentication method . [SEP]
[CLS] some microsoft additions to the ke ##rber ##os suite of protocols are documented in rfc 324 ##4 " microsoft windows 2000 ke ##rber ##os change password and set password protocols " . [SEP]
[CLS] rfc 475 ##7 documents microsoft ' s use of the rc ##4 cipher . [SEP]
[CLS] while microsoft uses and extends the ke ##rber ##os protocol , it does not use the mit software . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rber ##os is used as preferred authentication method : in general , joining a client to a windows domain means enabling ke ##rber ##os as default protocol for authentication ##s from that client to services in the windows domain and all domains with trust relationships to that domain . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , when either client or server or both are not joined to a domain ( or not part of the same trusted domain environment ) , windows will instead use nt ##lm for authentication between client and server . [SEP]
[CLS] intra ##net web applications can enforce ke ##rber ##os as an authentication method for domain joined clients by using api ##s provided under ss ##pi . [SEP]
[CLS] many unix and unix - like operating systems , including free ##bs ##d , open ##bs ##d , apple ' s mac ##os , red hat enterprise linux , oracle ' s solar ##is , ibm ' s aix and z / os , hp ' s hp - u ##x and open ##v ##ms and others , include software for ke ##rber ##os authentication of users or services . [SEP]
[CLS] embedded implementation of the ke ##rber ##os v authentication protocol for client agents and network services running on embedded platforms is also available from companies . [SEP]
[CLS] the client authentic ##ates itself to the server ( as ) which forwards the user ##name to a key distribution center ( k ##dc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the k ##dc issues a ticket - granting ticket ( t ##gt ) , which is time stamped and en ##cr ##yp ##ts it using the ticket - granting service ' s ( t ##gs ) secret key and returns the en ##cr ##yp ##ted result to the user ' s works ##tation . [SEP]
[CLS] this is done in ##fr ##e ##quent ##ly , typically at user logo ##n ; the t ##gt ex ##pire ##s at some point although it may be transparent ##ly renewed by the user ' s session manager while they are logged in . [SEP]
[CLS] when the client needs to communicate with another node ( " principal " in ke ##rber ##os par ##lance ) to some service on that node the client sends the t ##gt to the t ##gs , which usually shares the same host as the k ##dc . [SEP]
[CLS] service must be registered at t ##gt with a service principal name ( sp ##n ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the client uses the sp ##n to request access to this service . [SEP]
[CLS] after verify ##ing that the t ##gt is valid and that the user is permitted to access the requested service , the t ##gs issues ticket and session keys to the client . [SEP]
[CLS] the client then sends the ticket to the service server ( ss ) along with its service request . [SEP]
[CLS] the protocol is described in detail below . [SEP]
[CLS] the data encryption standard ( des ) cipher can be used in combination with ke ##rber ##os , but is no longer an internet standard because it is weak . [SEP]
[CLS] security vu ##ln ##era ##bilities exist in many legacy products that implement ke ##rber ##os because they have not been updated to use newer cipher ##s like ae ##s instead of des . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 2014 , microsoft released a patch ( ms ##14 - 06 ##8 ) to rec ##tify an exploit ##able vulnerability in windows implementation of the ke ##rber ##os key distribution center ( k ##dc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the vulnerability purported ##ly allows users to " el ##eva ##te " ( and abuse ) their privileges , up to domain level . [SEP]
