Dogs have been selectively bred for thousands of years, sometimes by inbreeding dogs from the same ancestral lines, while at other times by mixing dogs from very different lines.
The following list uses a wide interpretation of the word "breed".
Breeds are usually categorized by the functional type from which the breed was developed.
In some cases, a breed's origin overlaps the boundaries of two or more countries; the dog is thus normally listed only in the country with which it is most commonly associated; for example, by its designated country according to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI).
Some dogs, such as the Löwchen, have an uncertain origin and are thus listed under several countries.
