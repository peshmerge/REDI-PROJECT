More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks.
Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services.
Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.
Data structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by a pointer—a bit string, representing a memory address, that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program.
Thus, the array and record data structures are based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations, while the linked data structures are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself.
The implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure.
The efficiency of a data structure cannot be analyzed separately from those operations.
This observation motivates the theoretical concept of an abstract data type, a data structure that is defined indirectly by the operations that may be performed on it, and the mathematical properties of those operations (including their space and time cost).
On the other hand, many high-level programming languages and some higher-level assembly languages, such as MASM, have special syntax or other built-in support for certain data structures, such as records and arrays.
For example, the C (a direct descendant of BCPL) and Pascal languages support structs and records, respectively, in addition to vectors (one-dimensional arrays) and multi-dimensional arrays.
Most programming languages feature some sort of library mechanism that allows data structure implementations to be reused by different programs.
Modern languages usually come with standard libraries that implement the most common data structures.
Examples are the C++ Standard Template Library, the Java Collections Framework, and the Microsoft .N
Modern languages also generally support modular programming, the separation between the interface of a library module and its implementation.
