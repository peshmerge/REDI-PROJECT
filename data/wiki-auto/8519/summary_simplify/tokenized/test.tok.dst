[CLS] more precisely , a data structure is a collection of data values , the relationships among them , and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data . [SEP]
[CLS] different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications , and some are highly specialized to specific tasks . [SEP]
[CLS] data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet index ##ing services . [SEP]
[CLS] data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory . [SEP]
[CLS] data structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory , specified by a pointer â€” a bit string , representing a memory address , that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the array and record data structures are based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations , while the linked data structures are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself . [SEP]
[CLS] the implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure . [SEP]
[CLS] the efficiency of a data structure cannot be analyzed separately from those operations . [SEP]
[CLS] this observation mo ##tiv ##ates the theoretical concept of an abstract data type , a data structure that is defined indirectly by the operations that may be performed on it , and the mathematical properties of those operations ( including their space and time cost ) . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , many high - level programming languages and some higher - level assembly languages , such as mas ##m , have special syntax or other built - in support for certain data structures , such as records and arrays . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the c ( a direct descendant of bc ##pl ) and pascal languages support st ##ru ##cts and records , respectively , in addition to vectors ( one - dimensional arrays ) and multi - dimensional arrays . [SEP]
[CLS] most programming languages feature some sort of library mechanism that allows data structure implementations to be reused by different programs . [SEP]
[CLS] modern languages usually come with standard libraries that implement the most common data structures . [SEP]
[CLS] examples are the c + + standard template library , the java collections framework , and the microsoft . n [SEP]
[CLS] modern languages also generally support modular programming , the separation between the interface of a library module and its implementation . [SEP]
