[CLS] some paradox ##es have revealed errors in definitions assumed to be rigorous , and have caused ax ##ioms of mathematics and logic to be re - examined . [SEP]
[CLS] one example is russell ' s paradox , which questions whether a " list of all lists that do not contain themselves " would include itself , and showed that attempts to found set theory on the identification of sets with properties or pre ##dicate ##s were flawed . [SEP]
[CLS] examples outside logic include the ship of these ##us from philosophy ( questioning whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts , one at a time , would remain the same ship ) . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##cher featured perspective - based paradox ##es in many of his drawings , with walls that are regarded as floors from other points of view , and staircase ##s that appear to climb endless ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] in common usage , the word " paradox " often refers to statements that are ironic or unexpected , such as " the paradox that standing is more ti ##ring than walking " . [SEP]
[CLS] other paradox ##es involve false statements ( " ' impossible ' is not a word in my vocabulary " , a simple paradox ) or half - truths and the resulting biased assumptions . [SEP]
[CLS] the car crashes into a tree and the father is killed . [SEP]
[CLS] the apparent paradox is caused by a hasty general ##ization , for if the surgeon is the boy ' s father , the statement cannot be true . [SEP]
[CLS] the paradox is resolved if it is revealed that the surgeon is a woman — the boy ' s mother . [SEP]
[CLS] paradox ##es which are not based on a hidden error generally occur at the fringe ##s of context or language , and require extending the context or language in order to lose their paradox ##ical quality . [SEP]
[CLS] paradox ##es that arise from apparently intel ##li ##gible uses of language are often of interest to logic ##ians and philosophers . [SEP]
[CLS] " this sentence is false " is an example of the well - known liar paradox : it is a sentence which cannot be consistently interpreted as either true or false , because if it is known to be false , then it is known that it must be true , and if it is known to be true , then it is known that it must be false . [SEP]
[CLS] russell ' s paradox , which shows that the notion of " the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves " leads to a contradiction , was instrumental in the development of modern logic and set theory . [SEP]
[CLS] the grandfather paradox , for example , would arise if a time - traveler were to kill his own grandfather before his mother or father had been conceived , thereby preventing his own birth . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a specific example of the more general observation of the butterfly effect , or that a time - traveller ' s interaction with the past — however slight — would en ##tail making changes that would , in turn , change the future in which the time - travel was yet to occur , and would thus change the circumstances of the time - travel itself . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of that apparent paradox of a time - traveler killing his own grandfather , it is the inc ##ons ##iste ##ncy of defining the past to which he returns as being somehow different from the one which leads up to the future from which he begins his trip , but also insisting that he must have come to that past from the same future as the one that it leads up to . [SEP]
[CLS] a fourth kind , which may be alternatively interpreted as a special case of the third kind , has sometimes been described since qui ##ne ' s work . [SEP]
[CLS] s ##ø ##ren ki ##er ##ke ##gaard , for example , writes in the " philosophical fragments " that but one must not think ill of the paradox , for the paradox is the passion of thought , and the think ##er without the paradox is like the lover without passion : a med ##io ##cre fellow . [SEP]
[CLS] some are common and are used regularly in medicine , such as the use of st ##im ##ula ##nts such as add ##eral ##l and rita ##lin in the treatment of attention deficit hyper ##act ##ivity disorder ( also known as ad ##hd ) while others are rare and can be dangerous as they are not expected , such as severe agitation from a benz ##od ##ia ##ze ##pine .
