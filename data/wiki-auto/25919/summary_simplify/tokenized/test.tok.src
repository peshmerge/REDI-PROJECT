[CLS] rapids are sections of a river where the river bed has a relatively steep gradient , causing an increase in water velocity and turbulence . [SEP]
[CLS] rapids are hydro ##logical features between a " run " ( a smoothly flowing part of a stream ) and a " cascade " . [SEP]
[CLS] as flowing water splash ##es over and around the rocks , air bubbles become mixed in with it and portions of the surface acquire a white colour , forming what is called " white ##water " . [SEP]
[CLS] rapids occur where the bed material is highly resistant to the er ##osi ##ve power of the stream in comparison with the bed downstream of the rapids . [SEP]
[CLS] very young streams flowing across solid rock may be rapids for much of their length . [SEP]
[CLS] rapids cause water ae ##ration of the stream or river resulting in better water quality . [SEP]
[CLS] while class i rapids are easy to navigate and require little maneuver ##ing , class vi rapids pose threat to life with little or no chance for rescue . [SEP]
