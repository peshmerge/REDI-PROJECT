rapids are parts of a river where the river bed is steep , and there are some turbulence .
rapids are hydrological features between a " run " stream .
as flowing water splashes over and around the rocks , air bubbles become mixed in with it and portions of the surface acquire a white colour , forming what is called " whitewater " .
rapids occur where the bed material is resistant to the erosive power of the stream in comparison with the bed downstream of the rapids .
very young streams flowing across solid rock may be rapids for much of their length .
rapids cause water aeration of the stream resulting in better water quality .
while class i rapids are easy to navigate and require little maneuvering , class vi rapids pose threat to life with little or no chance for rescue .
