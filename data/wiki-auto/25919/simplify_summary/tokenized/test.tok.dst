[CLS] rapids are sections of a river where the river bed has a relatively steep gradient , causing an increase in water velocity and turbulence . [SEP]
[CLS] rapids are hydro ##logical features between a " run " ( a smoothly flowing part of a stream ) and a " cascade " . [SEP]
[CLS] rapids are characterised by the river becoming shallow ##er with some rocks exposed above the flow surface . [SEP]
[CLS] as flowing water splash ##es over and around the rocks , air bubbles become mixed in with it and portions of the surface acquire a white colour , forming what is called " white ##water " . [SEP]
[CLS] rapids occur where the bed material is highly resistant to the er ##osi ##ve power of the stream in comparison with the bed downstream of the rapids . [SEP]
[CLS] very young streams flowing across solid rock may be rapids for much of their length . [SEP]
[CLS] rapids cause water ae ##ration of the stream or river resulting in better water quality . [SEP]
[CLS] rapids are categorized in classes , generally running from i to vi . [SEP]
[CLS] a class 5 rapid may be categorized as class 5 . 1 - 5 . 9 . [SEP]
[CLS] while class i rapids are easy to navigate and require little maneuver ##ing , class vi rapids pose threat to life with little or no chance for rescue . [SEP]
[CLS] river raft ##ing sports are carried out where many rapids are present in the course . [SEP]
