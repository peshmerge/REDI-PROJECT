[CLS] fra angel ##ico ( born guido di pietro ; 139 ##5 february 18 , 145 ##5 ) was an italian painter of the early renaissance , described by va ##sari in his " lives of the artists " as having " a rare and perfect talent " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1982 , pope john paul ii proclaimed his beat ##ification in recognition of the holiness of his life , thereby making the title of " blessed " official . [SEP]
[CLS] fi ##es ##ole is sometimes mis ##int ##er ##pre ##ted as being part of his formal name , but it was merely the name of the town where he took his vows as a dominican friar , and was used by contemporaries to separate him from others who were also known as fra giovanni . [SEP]
[CLS] fra angel ##ico was born guido di pietro at ru ##pe ##can ##ina in the tu ##scan area of mug ##ello near fi ##es ##ole towards the end of the 14th century . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest recorded document concerning fra angel ##ico dates from october 17 , 141 ##7 when he joined a religious con ##fra ##tern ##ity or guild at the carmine church , still under the name of guido di pietro . [SEP]
[CLS] this record reveals that he was already a painter , a fact that is subsequently confirmed by two records of payment to guido di pietro in january and february 141 ##8 for work done in the church of santo stefano del pont ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] he was a member of the local community at fi ##es ##ole , not far from florence , of the dominican order ; one of the medieval orders belonging to a category known as men ##dic ##ant orders because they generally lived not from the income of estates but from begging or donations . [SEP]
[CLS] the former dominican convent of san marco in florence , now a state museum , holds several manuscripts that are thought to be entirely or partly by his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] the painter lorenzo monaco may have contributed to his art training , and the influence of the si ##enes ##e school is disc ##ern ##ible in his work . [SEP]
[CLS] he also trained with master var ##rich ##o in milan he had several important charges in the convent ##s he lived in , but this did not limit his art , which very soon became famous . [SEP]
[CLS] according to va ##sari , the first paintings of this artist were an altar ##piece and a painted screen for the charter ##house ( cart ##hus ##ian monastery ) of florence ; none such exist there now . [SEP]
[CLS] from 140 ##8 to 141 ##8 , fra angel ##ico was at the dominican friar ##y of co ##rton ##a , where he painted frescoes , now mostly destroyed , in the dominican church and may have been assistant to g ##her ##ardo star ##nin ##a or a follower of his . [SEP]
[CLS] a pre ##dell ##a of the altar ##piece remains intact and is conserved in the national gallery , london , and is a great example of fra angel ##ico ' s ability . [SEP]
[CLS] this was an important move which put him in the centre of artistic activity of the region and brought about the patronage of one of the wealthiest and most powerful members of the city ' s governing authority , or " sign ##oria " ( namely co ##si ##mo de ' medici ) , who had a cell reserved for himself at the friar ##y in order that he might retreat from the world . [SEP]
[CLS] it was , according to va ##sari , at co ##si ##mo ' s urging that fra angel ##ico set about the task of decor ##ating the convent , including the magnificent fresco of the chapter house , the often - reproduced ann ##unciation at the top of the stairs leading to the cells , the mae ##sta ( or coronation of the madonna ) with saints ( cell 9 ) and the many other devotion ##al frescoes , of smaller format but remarkable luminous quality , depicting aspects of the life of christ that ad ##orn the walls of each cell . [SEP]
[CLS] in 143 ##9 fra angel ##ico completed one of his most famous works , the " san marco altar ##piece " at florence . [SEP]
[CLS] images of the en ##th ##rone ##d madonna and child surrounded by saints were common , but they usually depicted a setting that was clearly heaven - like , in which saints and angels hovered about as divine presence ##s rather than people . [SEP]
[CLS] but in this instance , the saints stand square ##ly within the space , grouped in a natural way as if they were able to converse about the shared experience of witnessing the virgin in glory . [SEP]
[CLS] va ##sari claims that at this time fra angel ##ico was offered the archbishop ##ric of florence by pope nicholas v , and that he refused it , recommend ##ing another friar for the position . [SEP]
[CLS] however , if va ##sari ' s date is correct , then the pope must have been eugene iv and not nicholas , who was elected pope only on 6 march 144 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] from 144 ##7 to 144 ##9 fra angel ##ico was back at the vatican , designing the frescoes for the nic ##col ##ine chapel for nicholas v . [SEP]
[CLS] the scenes from the lives of the two martyr ##ed deacon ##s of the early christian church , st . stephen and st . lawrence may have been executed wholly or in part by assistants . [SEP]
[CLS] from 144 ##9 until 145 ##2 , fra angel ##ico returned to his old convent of fi ##es ##ole , where he was the prior . [SEP]
[CLS] this process of change had begun a hundred years previous with the works of gi ##otto and several of his contemporaries , notably gi ##ust ##o de ' men ##ab ##uo ##i , both of whom had created their major works in padua , although gi ##otto was trained in florence by the great gothic artist , ci ##ma ##bu ##e , and painted a fresco cycle of st francis in the bard ##i chapel in the basilica di santa cr ##oc ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] gi ##otto had many enthusiastic followers , who im ##itated his style in fresco , some of them , notably the loren ##ze ##tti , achieving great success . [SEP]
[CLS] the patrons of these artists were most often monastic establishments or wealthy families end ##owing a church . [SEP]
[CLS] paint made from these colours did not lend itself to a ton ##al treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] for these reasons , altar ##piece ##s are often much more conservative ##ly painted than frescoes , which were often of almost life - sized figures and relied upon a stage - set quality rather than lavish display in order to achieve effect . [SEP]
[CLS] gen ##tile ' s altar ##piece of the " ad ##oration of the mag ##i " , 142 ##3 , in the u ##ffi ##zi is regarded as one of the greatest works of the style known as international gothic . [SEP]
[CLS] few painters in florence saw his sturdy , life ##like and emotional figures and were not affected by them . [SEP]
[CLS] his work partner was an older painter , mas ##olin ##o , of the same generation as fra angel ##ico . [SEP]
[CLS] in the altar ##piece of the coronation of the virgin , painted for the fl ##ore ##ntine church of santa maria novella , are all the elements that a very expensive altar ##piece of the 14th century was expected to provide ; a precisely tool ##ed gold background , lots of azure , lots of ve ##rmi ##lion and an obvious display of arsenic green . [SEP]
[CLS] what makes this a renaissance painting , as against gen ##tile da fa ##bria ##no ' s masterpiece , is the solid ##ity , the three - dimensional ##ity and natural ##ism of the figures and the realistic way in which their garments hang or dr ##ape around them . [SEP]
[CLS] the series of frescoes that fra angel ##ico painted for the dominican friars at san marcos realise the advancement ##s made by mas ##ac ##cio and carry them further . [SEP]
[CLS] away from the constraints of wealthy clients and the limitations of panel painting , fra angel ##ico was able to express his deep rev ##erence for his god and his knowledge and love of humanity . [SEP]
[CLS] there is more ma ##u ##vish - pink than there is red , and the brilliant and expensive blue is almost totally lacking . [SEP]
[CLS] in its place is dull green and the black and white of dominican robes . [SEP]
[CLS] there is nothing lavish , nothing to distract from the spiritual experiences of the humble people who are depicted within the frescoes . [SEP]
[CLS] va ##sari relates that co ##si ##mo de ' medici seeing these works , inspired fra angel ##ico to create a large cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion scene with many saints for the chapter house . [SEP]
[CLS] as with the other frescoes , the wealthy patronage did not influence the friar ' s artistic expression with displays of wealth . [SEP]
[CLS] mas ##ac ##cio ventured into perspective with his creation of a realistic ##ally painted niche at santa maria novella . [SEP]
[CLS] subsequently , fra angel ##ico demonstrated an understanding of linear perspective particularly in his ann ##unciation paintings set inside the sort of arcade ##s that michel ##oz ##zo and br ##une ##lles ##chi created at san â€™ marco ' s and the square in front of it . [SEP]
[CLS] when fra angel ##ico and his assistants went to the vatican to decorate the chapel of pope nicholas , the artist was again confronted with the need to please the very wealthiest of clients . [SEP]
[CLS] the walls are deck ##ed with the brilliance of colour and gold that one sees in the most lavish creations of the gothic painter simone martini at the lower church of st francis of ass ##isi , a hundred years earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] the figures , in their lavish gilded robes , have the sweetness and gentle ##ness for which his works are famous . [SEP]
[CLS] according to va ##sari : in their bearing and expression , the saints painted by fra angel ##ico come nearer to the truth than the figures done by any other artist . [SEP]
[CLS] ben ##oz ##zo took his art further towards the fully developed renaissance style with his expressive and life ##like portraits in his masterpiece depicting the journey of the mag ##i , painted in the medici ' s private chapel at their palazzo . [SEP]
[CLS] through fra angel ##ico ' s pupil ben ##oz ##zo go ##zzo ##li ' s careful portrait ##ure and technical expertise in the art of fresco we see a link to domenico g ##hir ##landa ##io , who in turn painted extensive schemes for the wealthy patrons of florence , and through g ##hir ##landa ##io to his pupil michelangelo and the high renaissance . [SEP]
[CLS] apart from the line ##al connection , superficial ##ly there may seem little to link the humble priest with his sweetly pretty madonna ##s and timeless cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ions to the dynamic expressions of michelangelo ' s larger - than - life creations . [SEP]
[CLS] but both these artists received their most important commissions from the wealthiest and most powerful of all patrons , the vatican . [SEP]
[CLS] when michelangelo took up the sis ##tine chapel commission , he was working within a space that had already been extensively decorated by other artists . [SEP]
[CLS] around the walls the " life of christ " and " life of moses " were depicted by a range of artists including his teacher g ##hir ##landa ##io , raphael ' s teacher peru ##gin ##o and bot ##tic ##elli . [SEP]
[CLS] they were works of large scale and exactly the sort of lavish treatment to be expected in a vatican commission , v ##ying with each other in complexity of design , number of figures , el ##ab ##oration of detail and skill ##ful use of gold leaf . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo , when asked by pope julius ii to or ##name ##nt the robes of the apostles in the usual way , responded that they were very poor men . [SEP]
[CLS] within the cells of san â€™ marco , fra angel ##ico had demonstrated that painter ##ly skill and the artist ' s personal interpretation were sufficient to create memorable works of art , without the expensive trapping ##s of blue and gold . [SEP]
[CLS] in the use of the una ##dor ##ned fresco technique , the clear bright paste ##l colours , the careful arrangement of a few significant figures and the skill ##ful use of expression , motion and gesture , michelangelo showed himself to be the artistic descendant of fra angel ##ico . [SEP]
[CLS] rome co ##rton ##a fi ##es ##ole florence , santa tri ##ni ##ta florence , santa maria de ##gli angel ##i florence , santa maria novella [SEP]
[CLS] each cell is decorated with a fresco which matches in size and shape the single round - headed window beside it . [SEP]
[CLS] there are , particularly in the inner row of cells , some of less inspiring quality and of more repetitive subject , perhaps completed by assistants . [SEP]
[CLS] worldwide press coverage reported in november 2006 that two missing masterpiece ##s by fra angel ##ico had turned up , having hung in the spare room of the late jean preston , in her terrace house in oxford , england . [SEP]
[CLS] preston , an expert medieval ##ist , recognised them as being high quality fl ##ore ##ntine renaissance , but did not realize that they were works by fra angel ##ico until they were identified in 2005 by michael liver ##si ##dge of bristol university . [SEP]
[CLS] there was almost no demand at all for medieval art during the 1960s and no dealers showed any interest , so preston ' s father bought them almost as an after ##th ##ough ##t along with some manuscripts . [SEP]
[CLS] coincidentally the manuscripts turned out to be high quality victorian forge ##ries by the spanish forge ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] the paintings are two of eight side panels of a large altar ##piece painted in 143 ##9 for fra angel ##ico ' s monastery at san marco , which was later split up by napoleon ' s army . [SEP]
[CLS] while the centre section is still at the monastery , the other six small panels are in german and us museums . [SEP]
[CLS] both panels are now restored and exhibited in the san marco museum in florence . [SEP]
