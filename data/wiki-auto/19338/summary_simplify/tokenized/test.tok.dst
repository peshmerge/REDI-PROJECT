[CLS] a mountain system or mountain belt is a group of mountain ranges with similarity in form , structure , and alignment that have arise ##n from the same cause , usually an oro ##geny . [SEP]
[CLS] mountain ranges are formed by a variety of geological processes , but most of the significant ones on earth are the result of plate te ##cton ##ics . [SEP]
[CLS] mountain ranges are also found on many planetary mass objects in the solar system and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets . [SEP]
[CLS] individual mountains within the same mountain range do not necessarily have the same geologic structure or petrol ##ogy . [SEP]
[CLS] they may be a mix of different oro ##genic expressions and terra ##nes , for example thrust sheets , up ##lift ##ed blocks , fold mountains , and volcanic land ##forms resulting in a variety of rock types . [SEP]
[CLS] most geological ##ly young mountain ranges on the earth ' s land surface are associated with either the pacific ring of fire or the al ##pid ##e belt . [SEP]
[CLS] the pacific ring of fire includes the andes of south america , extends through the north american cord ##ille ##ra along the pacific coast , the ale ##uti ##an range , on through kam ##cha ##t ##ka , japan , taiwan , the philippines , papua new guinea , to new zealand . [SEP]
[CLS] mountain ranges outside these two systems include the arctic cord ##ille ##ra , the ur ##als , the appalachian ##s , the scandinavian mountains , the great dividing range , the alta ##i mountains and the hi ##ja ##z mountains . [SEP]
[CLS] if the definition of a mountain range is stretched to include underwater mountains , then the ocean ridges form the longest continuous mountain system on earth , with a length of 650 ##00 km . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the white mountains of new hampshire and the blue ridge mountains are sub - ranges of the appalachian mountains . [SEP]
[CLS] equivalent ##ly , the appalachian ##s are the parent of the white mountains and blue ridge mountains , and the white mountains and the blue ridge mountains are children of the appalachian ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] as the air descends on the lee ##ward side , it warm ##s again ( in accordance with the adi ##aba ##tic laps ##e rate ) and is dr ##ier , having been stripped of much of its moisture . [SEP]
[CLS] mountain ranges are constantly subjected to erosion ##al forces which work to tear them down . [SEP]
[CLS] the basins adjacent to an er ##od ##ing mountain range are then filled with sediments which are buried and turned into sedimentary rock . [SEP]
[CLS] erosion is at work while the mountains are being up ##lift ##ed until the mountains are reduced to low hills and plains . [SEP]
[CLS] as the up ##lift was occurring some 1000 ##0 ft of mostly me ##so ##zo ##ic sedimentary strata were removed by erosion over the core of the mountain range and spread as sand and clay ##s across the great plains to the east . [SEP]
[CLS] computer simulation has shown that as mountain belts change from te ##cton ##ically active to inactive , the rate of erosion drops because there are fewer ab ##ras ##ive particles in the water and fewer landslide ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] mountains on other planets and natural satellites of the solar system are often isolated and formed mainly by processes such as impacts , though there are examples of mountain ranges ( or " monte ##s " ) somewhat similar to those on earth . [SEP]
[CLS] some terrestrial planets other than earth also exhibit rocky mountain ranges , such as maxwell monte ##s on venus taller than any on earth and tar ##tar ##us monte ##s on mars , jupiter ' s moon io has mountain ranges formed from te ##cton ##ic processes including boo ##sau ##le monte ##s , dorian monte ##s , hi ' ia ##ka monte ##s and eu ##bo ##ea monte ##s .
