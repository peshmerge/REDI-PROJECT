Emperor Annei (安寧天皇 , Annei-tennō ) , also known as "Shikitsuhikotamatemi no Mikoto" (師木津日子玉手見命 ) was the third Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
Annei is known as a "legendary emperor" among historians as his actual existence is disputed.
After his death in 511 BC, his second or third son supposedly became the next emperor.
Emperor Annei's name appears in both the "Kojiki" and "Nihon Shoki" where only his genealogy are recorded.
Before his accession to the throne, he was allegedly known as Prince Shikitsu-hiko Tamatemi.
During Emperor Annei's alleged lifetime, he had one wife named "Nunasoko-Nakatsu-hime" and fathered three children with her.
Annei's reign lasted from 549 BC until his death in 511 BC, his second or third son then took the throne and would later be referred to as Emperor Itoku.
"Annei" is thus regarded by historians as a "legendary Emperor", and is considered to have been the second of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them.
His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Annei, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the Yamato dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the "Kojiki".
While the actual site of Annei's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") in Kashihara.
The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Annei's mausoleum, and is formally named "Unebi-yama no hitsujisaru Mihodo no i no e no misasagi".
The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as "traditional" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.
