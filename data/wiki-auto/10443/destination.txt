Emperor Annei (安寧天皇, "Annei-tennō") was the 3rd emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.
