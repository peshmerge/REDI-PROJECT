[CLS] manor ##ial ##ism or se ##ign ##oria ##lism was an organizing principle of rural economies which vested legal and economic power in a lord of the manor . [SEP]
[CLS] he was supported economically from his own direct land ##holding in a manor ( sometimes called a fi ##ef ) , and from the obligatory contributions of a legally subject part of the peasant population under his jurisdiction and that of his manor ##ial court . [SEP]
[CLS] these obligations could be pay ##able in several ways , in labor ( the french term " co ##r ##ve ##e " is conventional ##ly applied ) , in kind , or , on rare occasions , in coin . [SEP]
[CLS] manor ##ial ##ism originated in the roman villa system of the late roman empire , and was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central europe as well as china . [SEP]
[CLS] an essential element of feudal society , manor ##ial ##ism was slowly replaced by the advent of a money - based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract . [SEP]
[CLS] in examining the origins of the monastic cl ##ois ##ter , walter horn found that " as a manor ##ial entity the carol ##ing ##ian monastery . . . differed little from the fabric of a feudal estate , save that the corporate community of men for whose su ##sten ##ance this organization was maintained consisted of monks who served god in chant and spent much of their time in reading and writing . " [SEP]
[CLS] manor ##ial ##ism died slowly and piece ##me ##al , along with its most vivid feature in the landscape , the open field system . [SEP]
[CLS] it out ##las ##ted ser ##f ##dom as it out ##las ##ted feudal ##ism : " primarily an economic organization , it could maintain a warrior , but it could equally well maintain a capitalist landlord . [SEP]
[CLS] it could be self - sufficient , yield produce for the market , or it could yield a money rent . " [SEP]
[CLS] the last feudal due ##s in france were abolished at the french revolution . [SEP]
[CLS] in parts of eastern germany , the " ritter ##gut " manor ##s of junk ##ers remained until world war ii . [SEP]
[CLS] in quebec , the last feudal rents were paid in 1970 under the modified provisions of the " se ##ign ##ior ##ial due ##s abolition act " of 1935 . [SEP]
[CLS] the term is most often used with reference to medieval western europe . [SEP]
[CLS] ant ##ece ##dents of the system can be traced to the rural economy of the later roman empire ( dominate ) . [SEP]
[CLS] with a declining birth ##rate and population , labor was the key factor of production . [SEP]
[CLS] successive administrations tried to stab ##ilis ##e the imperial economy by freezing the social structure into place : sons were to succeed their fathers in their trade , council ##ors were forbidden to resign , and " colon ##i " , the cult ##iva ##tors of land , were not to move from the land they were attached to . [SEP]
[CLS] the workers of the land were on their way to becoming ser ##fs . [SEP]
[CLS] several factors con ##sp ##ired to merge the status of former slaves and former free farmers into a dependent class of such " colon ##i " : it was possible to be described as " ser ##vus et colon ##us " , " both slave and " colon ##us " " . [SEP]
[CLS] laws of constantine i around 325 both reinforced the semi - ser ##vil ##e status of the " colon ##i " and limited their rights to sue in the courts ; the " codex theo ##dos ##ian ##us " prom ##ul ##gated under theo ##dos ##ius ii extended these restrictions . [SEP]
[CLS] the legal status of " ads ##cript ##i " , " bound to the soil " , contrasted with barbarian " foe ##der ##ati " , who were permitted to settle within the imperial boundaries , remaining subject to their own traditional law . [SEP]
[CLS] as the germanic kingdoms succeeded roman authority in the west in the fifth century , roman landlord ##s were often simply replaced by germanic ones , with little change to the underlying situation or displacement of populations . [SEP]
[CLS] the process of rural self - su ##ffi ##ciency was given an abrupt boost in the eighth century , when normal trade in the mediterranean sea was disrupted . [SEP]
[CLS] the thesis put forward by henri pi ##ren ##ne suppose ##s that the arab conquest ##s forced the medieval economy into even greater rural ##ization and gave rise to the classic feudal pattern of varying degrees of ser ##vil ##e peasant ##ry under ##pin ##ning a hierarchy of local ##ised power centers . [SEP]
[CLS] the word derives from traditional inherited divisions of the countryside , reassigned as local jurisdictions known as manor ##s or se ##ign ##eur ##ies ; each manor being subject to a lord ( french " se ##ign ##eur " ) , usually holding his position in return for undertaking ##s offered to a higher lord ( see feudal ##ism ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the lord held a manor ##ial court , governed by public law and local custom . [SEP]
[CLS] not all territorial se ##ign ##eurs were secular ; bishops and abbot ##s also held lands that en ##tail ##ed similar obligations . [SEP]
[CLS] by extension , the word " manor " is sometimes used in england to mean any home area or territory in which authority is held , often in a police or criminal context . [SEP]
[CLS] in the generic plan of a medieval manor from " shepherd ' s historical atlas " , the strips of individually worked land in the open field system are immediately apparent . [SEP]
[CLS] in this plan , the manor house is set slightly apart from the village , but equally often the village grew up around the fore ##court of the manor , formerly walled , while the manor lands stretched away outside , as still may be seen at pet ##worth house . [SEP]
[CLS] as concerns for privacy increased in the 18th century , manor houses were often located a farther distance from the village . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , when a grand new house was required by the new owner of ha ##rl ##ax ##ton manor , lincolnshire , in the 1830s , the site of the existing manor house at the edge of its village was abandoned for a new one , isolated in its park , with the village out of view . [SEP]
[CLS] in an agrarian society , the conditions of land tenure under ##lie all social or economic factors . [SEP]
[CLS] there were two legal systems of pre - manor ##ial land ##holding . [SEP]
[CLS] one , the most common , was the system of holding land " " all ##od ##ial ##ly " " in full outright ownership . [SEP]
[CLS] the other was a use of " pre ##car ##ia " or ben ##ef ##ices , in which land was held conditional ##ly ( the root of the english word " pre ##car ##ious " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] to these two systems , the carol ##ing ##ian monarchs added a third , the " apr ##isi ##o " , which linked manor ##ial ##ism with feudal ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] the " apr ##isi ##o " made its first appearance in charlemagne ' s province of sept ##iman ##ia in the south of france , when charlemagne had to settle the vis ##igo ##thic refugees who had fled with his retreating forces after the failure of his zaragoza expedition of 77 ##8 . [SEP]
[CLS] he solved this problem by all ##otti ##ng " desert " tracts of un ##cu ##lt ##ivated land belonging to the royal " fis ##c " under direct control of the emperor . [SEP]
[CLS] these holdings " apr ##isi ##o " en ##tail ##ed specific conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest specific " apr ##isi ##o " grant that has been identified was at font ##jon ##cous ##e , near na ##rb ##onne ( see lewis , links ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in former roman settlements , a system of villas , dating from late antiquity , was inherited by the medieval world . [SEP]
[CLS] additional sources of income for the lord included charges for use of his mill , bakery or wine - press , or for the right to hunt or to let pigs feed in his woodland , as well as court revenues and single payments on each change of tenant . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other side of the account , manor ##ial administration involved significant expenses , perhaps a reason why smaller manor ##s tended to rely less on ville ##in tenure . [SEP]
[CLS] dependent holdings were held nominally by arrangement of lord and tenant , but tenure became in practice almost universally hereditary , with a payment made to the lord on each succession of another member of the family . [SEP]
[CLS] ville ##in land could not be abandoned , at least until demographic and economic circumstances made flight a viable proposition ; nor could they be passed to a third party without the lord ' s permission , and the customary payment . [SEP]
[CLS] although not free , ville ##ins were by no means in the same position as slaves : they enjoyed legal rights , subject to local custom , and had rec ##ours ##e to the law subject to court charges , which were an additional source of manor ##ial income . [SEP]
[CLS] sub - letting of ville ##in holdings was common , and labour on the dem ##es ##ne might be commuted into an additional money payment , as happened increasingly from the 13th century . [SEP]
[CLS] like feudal ##ism which , together with manor ##ial ##ism , formed the legal and organizational framework of feudal society , manor ##ial structures were not uniform or coordinated . [SEP]
[CLS] in the later middle ages , areas of incomplete or non - existent manor ##ial ##ization persisted while the manor ##ial economy underwent substantial development with changing economic conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] not all manor ##s contained all three classes of land . [SEP]
[CLS] typically , dem ##es ##ne accounted for roughly a third of the arab ##le area , and ville ##in holdings rather more ; but some manor ##s consisted solely of dem ##es ##ne , others solely of peasant holdings . [SEP]
[CLS] the proportion of un ##free and free tenure ##s could likewise vary greatly , with more or less reliance on wage labour for agricultural work on the dem ##es ##ne . [SEP]
[CLS] the proportion of the cultivated area in dem ##es ##ne tended to be greater in smaller manor ##s , while the share of ville ##in land was greater in large manor ##s , providing the lord of the latter with a larger supply of obligatory labour for dem ##es ##ne work . [SEP]
[CLS] the proportion of free ten ##ement ##s was generally less variable , but tended to be somewhat greater on the smaller manor ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] manor ##s varied similarly in their geographical arrangement : most did not coincide with a single village , but rather consisted of parts of two or more villages , most of the latter containing also parts of at least one other manor . [SEP]
[CLS] this situation sometimes led to replacement by cash payments or their equivalent ##s in kind of the dem ##es ##ne labour obligations of those peasants living fur ##thest from the lord ' s estate . [SEP]
[CLS] as with peasant plots , the dem ##es ##ne was not a single territorial unit , but consisted rather of a central house with neighbouring land and estate buildings , plus strips dispersed through the manor alongside free and ville ##in ones : in addition , the lord might lease free ten ##ement ##s belonging to neighbouring manor ##s , as well as holding other manor ##s some distance away to provide a greater range of produce . [SEP]
[CLS] nor were manor ##s held necessarily by lay lords rendering military service ( or again , cash in lieu ) to their superior : a substantial share ( estimated by value at 17 % in england in 1086 ) belonged directly to the king , and a greater proportion ( rather more than a quarter ) were held by bishopric ##s and monasteries . [SEP]
[CLS] ecclesiastical manor ##s tended to be larger , with a significantly greater ville ##in area than neighbouring lay manor ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the effect of circumstances on manor ##ial economy is complex and at times contradictory : upland conditions tended to preserve peasant freedoms ( livestock husband ##ry in particular being less labour - intensive and therefore less demanding of ville ##in services ) ; on the other hand , some upland areas of europe showed some of the most oppressive manor ##ial conditions , while lowland eastern england is credited with an exceptionally large free peasant ##ry , in part a legacy of scandinavian settlement . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , the spread of money economy stimulated the replacement of labour services by money payments , but the growth of the money supply and resulting inflation after 117 ##0 initially led nobles to take back leased estates and to re - impose labour due ##s as the value of fixed cash payments declined in real terms .
