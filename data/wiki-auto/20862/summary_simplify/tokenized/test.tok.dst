[CLS] manor ##ial ##ism or se ##ign ##oria ##lism was an organizing principle of rural economies which vested legal and economic power in a lord of the manor . [SEP]
[CLS] manor ##ial ##ism originated in the roman villa system of the late roman empire , and was widely practiced in medieval western and parts of central europe as well as china . [SEP]
[CLS] an essential element of feudal society , manor ##ial ##ism was slowly replaced by the advent of a money - based market economy and new forms of agrarian contract . [SEP]
[CLS] in examining the origins of the monastic cl ##ois ##ter , walter horn found that " as a manor ##ial entity the carol ##ing ##ian monastery . . . differed little from the fabric of a feudal estate , save that the corporate community of men for whose su ##sten ##ance this organization was maintained consisted of monks who served god in chant and spent much of their time in reading and writing . " [SEP]
[CLS] in quebec , the last feudal rents were paid in 1970 under the modified provisions of the " se ##ign ##ior ##ial due ##s abolition act " of 1935 . [SEP]
[CLS] successive administrations tried to stab ##ilis ##e the imperial economy by freezing the social structure into place : sons were to succeed their fathers in their trade , council ##ors were forbidden to resign , and " colon ##i " , the cult ##iva ##tors of land , were not to move from the land they were attached to . [SEP]
[CLS] laws of constantine i around 325 both reinforced the semi - ser ##vil ##e status of the " colon ##i " and limited their rights to sue in the courts ; the " codex theo ##dos ##ian ##us " prom ##ul ##gated under theo ##dos ##ius ii extended these restrictions . [SEP]
[CLS] the legal status of " ads ##cript ##i " , " bound to the soil " , contrasted with barbarian " foe ##der ##ati " , who were permitted to settle within the imperial boundaries , remaining subject to their own traditional law . [SEP]
[CLS] as the germanic kingdoms succeeded roman authority in the west in the fifth century , roman landlord ##s were often simply replaced by germanic ones , with little change to the underlying situation or displacement of populations . [SEP]
[CLS] the process of rural self - su ##ffi ##ciency was given an abrupt boost in the eighth century , when normal trade in the mediterranean sea was disrupted . [SEP]
[CLS] the thesis put forward by henri pi ##ren ##ne suppose ##s that the arab conquest ##s forced the medieval economy into even greater rural ##ization and gave rise to the classic feudal pattern of varying degrees of ser ##vil ##e peasant ##ry under ##pin ##ning a hierarchy of local ##ised power centers . [SEP]
[CLS] the word derives from traditional inherited divisions of the countryside , reassigned as local jurisdictions known as manor ##s or se ##ign ##eur ##ies ; each manor being subject to a lord ( french " se ##ign ##eur " ) , usually holding his position in return for undertaking ##s offered to a higher lord ( see feudal ##ism ) . [SEP]
[CLS] by extension , the word " manor " is sometimes used in england to mean any home area or territory in which authority is held , often in a police or criminal context . [SEP]
[CLS] in the generic plan of a medieval manor from " shepherd ' s historical atlas " , the strips of individually worked land in the open field system are immediately apparent . [SEP]
[CLS] in this plan , the manor house is set slightly apart from the village , but equally often the village grew up around the fore ##court of the manor , formerly walled , while the manor lands stretched away outside , as still may be seen at pet ##worth house . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , when a grand new house was required by the new owner of ha ##rl ##ax ##ton manor , lincolnshire , in the 1830s , the site of the existing manor house at the edge of its village was abandoned for a new one , isolated in its park , with the village out of view . [SEP]
[CLS] he solved this problem by all ##otti ##ng " desert " tracts of un ##cu ##lt ##ivated land belonging to the royal " fis ##c " under direct control of the emperor . [SEP]
[CLS] in former roman settlements , a system of villas , dating from late antiquity , was inherited by the medieval world . [SEP]
[CLS] additional sources of income for the lord included charges for use of his mill , bakery or wine - press , or for the right to hunt or to let pigs feed in his woodland , as well as court revenues and single payments on each change of tenant . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other side of the account , manor ##ial administration involved significant expenses , perhaps a reason why smaller manor ##s tended to rely less on ville ##in tenure . [SEP]
[CLS] dependent holdings were held nominally by arrangement of lord and tenant , but tenure became in practice almost universally hereditary , with a payment made to the lord on each succession of another member of the family . [SEP]
[CLS] ville ##in land could not be abandoned , at least until demographic and economic circumstances made flight a viable proposition ; nor could they be passed to a third party without the lord ' s permission , and the customary payment . [SEP]
[CLS] although not free , ville ##ins were by no means in the same position as slaves : they enjoyed legal rights , subject to local custom , and had rec ##ours ##e to the law subject to court charges , which were an additional source of manor ##ial income . [SEP]
[CLS] typically , dem ##es ##ne accounted for roughly a third of the arab ##le area , and ville ##in holdings rather more ; but some manor ##s consisted solely of dem ##es ##ne , others solely of peasant holdings . [SEP]
[CLS] the proportion of the cultivated area in dem ##es ##ne tended to be greater in smaller manor ##s , while the share of ville ##in land was greater in large manor ##s , providing the lord of the latter with a larger supply of obligatory labour for dem ##es ##ne work . [SEP]
[CLS] manor ##s varied similarly in their geographical arrangement : most did not coincide with a single village , but rather consisted of parts of two or more villages , most of the latter containing also parts of at least one other manor . [SEP]
[CLS] this situation sometimes led to replacement by cash payments or their equivalent ##s in kind of the dem ##es ##ne labour obligations of those peasants living fur ##thest from the lord ' s estate . [SEP]
[CLS] as with peasant plots , the dem ##es ##ne was not a single territorial unit , but consisted rather of a central house with neighbouring land and estate buildings , plus strips dispersed through the manor alongside free and ville ##in ones : in addition , the lord might lease free ten ##ement ##s belonging to neighbouring manor ##s , as well as holding other manor ##s some distance away to provide a greater range of produce . [SEP]
[CLS] nor were manor ##s held necessarily by lay lords rendering military service ( or again , cash in lieu ) to their superior : a substantial share ( estimated by value at 17 % in england in 1086 ) belonged directly to the king , and a greater proportion ( rather more than a quarter ) were held by bishopric ##s and monasteries . [SEP]
[CLS] the effect of circumstances on manor ##ial economy is complex and at times contradictory : upland conditions tended to preserve peasant freedoms ( livestock husband ##ry in particular being less labour - intensive and therefore less demanding of ville ##in services ) ; on the other hand , some upland areas of europe showed some of the most oppressive manor ##ial conditions , while lowland eastern england is credited with an exceptionally large free peasant ##ry , in part a legacy of scandinavian settlement . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , the spread of money economy stimulated the replacement of labour services by money payments , but the growth of the money supply and resulting inflation after 117 ##0 initially led nobles to take back leased estates and to re - impose labour due ##s as the value of fixed cash payments declined in real terms .
