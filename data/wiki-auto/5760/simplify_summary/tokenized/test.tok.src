[CLS] the earliest known written records of the history of china date from as early as 125 ##0 bc , from the shang dynasty ( c . 1600 – 104 ##6 bc ) , during the king wu ding ' s reign , who was mentioned as the twenty - first shang king by the same . [SEP]
[CLS] ancient historical texts such as the " records of the grand historian " ( c . 100 bc ) and the " bamboo annals " ( 296 bc ) describe a xi ##a dynasty ( c . 207 ##0 – 1600 bc ) before the shang , but no writing is known from the period , and shang writings do not indicate the existence of the xi ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] the shang ruled in the yellow river valley , which is commonly held to be the cradle of chinese civilization . [SEP]
[CLS] however , neolithic civilizations originated at various cultural centers along both the yellow river and yang ##tze river . [SEP]
[CLS] these yellow river and yang ##tze civilizations arose millennia before the shang . [SEP]
[CLS] with thousands of years of continuous history , china is one of the world ' s oldest civilizations , and is regarded as one of the cradle ##s of civilization . [SEP]
[CLS] the zhou dynasty ( 104 ##6 – 256 bc ) su ##pp ##lan ##ted the shang , and introduced the concept of the mandate of heaven to justify their rule . [SEP]
[CLS] the central zhou government began to weaken due to external and internal pressures in the 8th century bc , and the country eventually splinter ##ed into smaller states during the spring and autumn period . [SEP]
[CLS] these states became independent and war ##red with one another in the following warring states period . [SEP]
[CLS] much of traditional chinese culture , literature and philosophy first developed during those troubled times . [SEP]
[CLS] in 221 bc , qin shi huang conquered the various warring states and created for himself the title of " huang ##di " or " emperor " of the qin , marking the beginning of imperial china . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the oppressive government fell soon after his death , and was su ##pp ##lan ##ted by the longer - lived han dynasty ( 206 bc – 220 ad ) . [SEP]
[CLS] successive dynasties developed bureau ##cratic systems that enabled the emperor to control vast territories directly . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 21 centuries from 206 bc until ad 1912 , routine administrative tasks were handled by a special elite of " scholar - officials " . [SEP]
[CLS] young men , well - verse ##d in call ##igraphy , history , literature , and philosophy , were carefully selected through difficult government examinations . [SEP]
[CLS] china ' s last dynasty was the qing ( 1644 – 1912 ) , which was replaced by the republic of china in 1912 , and in the mainland by the people ' s republic of china in 1949 , resulting in two " de facto " states claiming to be the legitimate government of all china . [SEP]
[CLS] chinese history has alternate ##d between periods of political unity and peace , and periods of war and failed statehood – the most recent being the chinese civil war ( 1927 – 1949 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] china was occasionally dominated by steppe peoples , most of whom were eventually ass ##imi ##lated into the han chinese culture and population . [SEP]
[CLS] between eras of multiple kingdoms and warlord ##ism , chinese dynasties have ruled parts or all of china ; in some eras control stretched as far as xinjiang and tibet , as at present . [SEP]
[CLS] traditional culture , and influences from other parts of asia and the western world ( carried by waves of immigration , cultural assimilation , expansion , and foreign contact ) , form the basis of the modern culture of china . [SEP]
[CLS] what is now china was inhabited by " homo erect ##us " more than a million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] recent study shows that the stone tools found at xiao ##chang ##lian ##g site are magnet ##ost ##rat ##ig ##raphic ##ally dated to 1 . 36 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] the archaeological site of xi ##ho ##ud ##u in shan ##xi province has evidence of use of fire by " homo erect ##us " , which is dated 1 . 27 million years ago , and " homo erect ##us " fossils in china include the yuan ##mo ##u man , the lan ##tian man and the peking man . [SEP]
[CLS] fossil ##ised teeth of " homo sap ##iens " dating to 125 , 000 – 80 , 000 bc have been discovered in fu ##yan cave in da ##o county in hunan . [SEP]
[CLS] evidence of middle pal ##ae ##oli ##thic lev ##all ##ois technology has been found in the lit ##hic ass ##em ##bla ##ge of gu ##any ##ind ##ong cave site in southwest china , dated to approximately 170 , 000 – 80 , 000 years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] the neolithic age in china can be traced back to about 10 , 000 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest evidence of cultivated rice , found by the yang ##tze river , is carbon - dated to 8 , 000 years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] early evidence for proto - chinese mill ##et agriculture is radio ##carbon - dated to about 700 ##0 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] farming gave rise to the jia ##hu culture ( 700 ##0 to 580 ##0 bc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] at dam ##aid ##i in ni ##ng ##xia , 3 , 172 cliff carvings dating to 6000 – 5000 bc have been discovered , " featuring 8 , 45 ##3 individual characters such as the sun , moon , stars , gods and scenes of hunting or grazing " . [SEP]
[CLS] these pic ##to ##graphs are reputed to be similar to the earliest characters confirmed to be written chinese . [SEP]
[CLS] chinese proto - writing existed in jia ##hu around 700 ##0 bc , dad ##i ##wan from 580 ##0 bc to 540 ##0 bc , dam ##aid ##i around 6000 bc and ban ##po dating from the 5th millennium bc . [SEP]
[CLS] some scholars have suggested that jia ##hu symbols ( 7th millennium bc ) were the earliest chinese writing system . [SEP]
[CLS] excavation of a pei ##liga ##ng culture site in xi ##nz ##hen ##g county , henan , found a community that flourished in 5 , 500 to 4 , 900 bc , with evidence of agriculture , constructed buildings , pottery , and burial of the dead . [SEP]
[CLS] with agriculture came increased population , the ability to store and red ##ist ##ri ##bu ##te crops , and the potential to support specialist craftsmen and administrators . [SEP]
[CLS] in late neolithic times , the yellow river valley began to establish itself as a center of yang ##sha ##o culture ( 5000 bc to 3000 bc ) , and the first villages were founded ; the most archaeological ##ly significant of these was found at ban ##po , xi ' an . [SEP]
[CLS] later , yang ##sha ##o culture was superseded by the long ##shan culture , which was also centered on the yellow river from about 3000 bc to 2000 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] bronze artifacts have been found at the maj ##ia ##ya ##o culture site ( between 310 ##0 and 270 ##0 bc ) , the bronze age is also represented at the lower xi ##aj ##iad ##ian culture ( 220 ##0 – 1600 bc ) site in northeast china . [SEP]
[CLS] san ##xing ##du ##i located in what is now sichuan province is believed to be the site of a major ancient city , of a previously unknown bronze age culture ( between 2000 and 1200 bc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the site was first discovered in 1929 and then re - discovered in 1986 . [SEP]
[CLS] chinese archaeologists have identified the san ##xing ##du ##i culture to be part of the ancient kingdom of shu , linking the artifacts found at the site to its early legendary kings . [SEP]
[CLS] fe ##rro ##us metal ##lu ##rgy begins to appear in the late 6th century in the yang ##zi valley . [SEP]
[CLS] a bronze tom ##aha ##wk with a blade of meteor ##ic iron excavated near the city of gao ##cheng in shi ##jia ##zh ##uan ##g ( now he ##bei province ) has been dated to the 14th century bc . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , authors such as lia ##na chu ##a and mark elliott have used the term " iron age " by convention for the transitional period of c . 500 bc to 100 bc , roughly corresponding to the warring states period of chinese his ##tori ##ography . [SEP]
[CLS] an iron age culture of the tibetan plateau has tentatively been associated with the zhang zhu ##ng culture described in early tibetan writings . [SEP]
[CLS] the xi ##a dynasty of china ( from c . 207 ##0 to c . 1600 bc ) is the first dynasty to be described in ancient historical records such as sima qi ##an ' s " records of the grand historian " and " bamboo annals " . [SEP]
[CLS] the dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early bronze age sites at er ##lit ##ou , henan in 1959 . [SEP]
[CLS] with few clear records matching the shang oracle bones , it remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the xi ##a dynasty or of another culture from the same period . [SEP]
[CLS] excavations that overlap the alleged time period of the xi ##a indicate a type of culturally similar grouping ##s of chief ##dom ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] early markings from this period found on pottery and shells are thought to be ancestral to modern chinese characters . [SEP]
[CLS] according to ancient records , the dynasty ended around 1600 bc as a consequence of the battle of ming ##tia ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] archaeological findings providing evidence for the existence of the shang dynasty , c . 1600 – 104 ##6 bc , are divided into two sets . [SEP]
[CLS] the first set , from the earlier shang period , comes from sources at er ##liga ##ng , zheng ##zhou , and shang ##cheng . [SEP]
[CLS] the second set , from the later shang or yin ( [UNK] ) period , is at anya ##ng , in modern - day henan , which has been confirmed as the last of the shang ' s nine capitals ( c . 1300 – 104 ##6 bc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the findings at anya ##ng include the earliest written record of the chinese so far discovered : inscriptions of di ##vina ##tion records in ancient chinese writing on the bones or shells of animals — the " oracle bones " , dating from around 125 ##0 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] a series of thirty - one kings reigned over the shang dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] during their reign , according to the " records of the grand historian " , the capital city was moved six times . [SEP]
[CLS] the final ( and most important ) move was to yin in 135 ##0 bc which led to the dynasty ' s golden age . [SEP]
[CLS] the term yin dynasty has been synonymous with the shang dynasty in history , although it has lately been used to refer specifically to the latter half of the shang dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] chinese historians in later periods were accustomed to the notion of one dynasty succeeding another , but the political situation in early china was much more complicated . [SEP]
[CLS] hence , as some scholars of china suggest , the xi ##a and the shang can refer to political entities that existed concurrently , just as the early zhou existed at the same time as the shang . [SEP]
[CLS] although written records found at anya ##ng confirm the existence of the shang dynasty , western scholars are often hesitant to associate settlements that are con ##tem ##por ##aneous with the anya ##ng settlement with the shang dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , archaeological findings at san ##xing ##du ##i suggest a technological ##ly advanced civilization culturally unlike anya ##ng . [SEP]
[CLS] the evidence is inc ##on ##clusive in proving how far the shang realm extended from anya ##ng . [SEP]
[CLS] the leading hypothesis is that anya ##ng , ruled by the same shang in the official history , coe ##xi ##sted and traded with numerous other culturally diverse settlements in the area that is now referred to as china proper . [SEP]
[CLS] the zhou dynasty ( 104 ##6 bc to approximately 256 bc ) is the longest - lasting dynasty in chinese history . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of the 2nd millennium bc , the zhou dynasty began to emerge in the yellow river valley , overrun ##ning the territory of the shang . [SEP]
[CLS] the zhou appeared to have begun their rule under a semi - feudal system . [SEP]
[CLS] the zhou lived west of the shang , and the zhou leader was appointed western protector by the shang . [SEP]
[CLS] the ruler of the zhou , king wu , with the assistance of his brother , the duke of zhou , as regent , managed to defeat the shang at the battle of mu ##ye . [SEP]
[CLS] the king of zhou at this time invoked the concept of the mandate of heaven to leg ##iti ##mi ##ze his rule , a concept that was influential for almost every succeeding dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] like shang ##di , heaven ( " tian " ) ruled over all the other gods , and it decided who would rule china . [SEP]
[CLS] it was believed that a ruler lost the mandate of heaven when natural disasters occurred in great number , and when , more realistic ##ally , the sovereign had apparently lost his concern for the people . [SEP]
[CLS] in response , the royal house would be overthrow ##n , and a new house would rule , having been granted the mandate of heaven . [SEP]
[CLS] the zhou initially moved their capital west to an area near modern xi ' an , on the wei river , a tributary of the yellow river , but they would pre ##side over a series of expansion ##s into the yang ##tze river valley . [SEP]
[CLS] this would be the first of many population migration ##s from north to south in chinese history . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 8th century bc , power became decent ##ral ##ized during the spring and autumn period , named after the influential " spring and autumn annals " . [SEP]
[CLS] in this period , local military leaders used by the zhou began to assert their power and vie for he ##ge ##mony . [SEP]
[CLS] the situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest , such as the qin , forcing the zhou to move their capital east to lu ##oya ##ng . [SEP]
[CLS] this marks the second major phase of the zhou dynasty : the eastern zhou . [SEP]
[CLS] the spring and autumn period is marked by a falling apart of the central zhou power . [SEP]
[CLS] in each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose , local strong ##men held most of the political power and continued their sub ##ser ##vie ##nce to the zhou kings in name only . [SEP]
[CLS] some local leaders even started using royal titles for themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] china now consisted of hundreds of states , some of them only as large as a village with a fort . [SEP]
[CLS] as the era continued , larger and more powerful states annexed or claimed su ##zer ##aint ##y over smaller ones . [SEP]
[CLS] by the 6th century bc most small states had disappeared by being annexed and just a few large and powerful principal ##ities dominated china . [SEP]
[CLS] some southern states , such as chu and wu , claimed independence from the zhou , who undertook wars against some of them ( wu and yue ) . [SEP]
[CLS] many new cities were established in this period and chinese culture was slowly shaped . [SEP]
[CLS] once all these powerful rulers had firmly established themselves within their respective dominion ##s , the blood ##shed focused more fully on interstate conflict in the warring states period , which began when the three remaining elite families in the jin state — zhao , wei and han — partition ##ed the state . [SEP]
[CLS] many famous individuals such as lao ##zi , con ##fu ##cius and sun t ##zu lived during this chaotic period . [SEP]
[CLS] the hundred schools of thought of chinese philosophy blossom ##ed during this period , and such influential intellectual movements as con ##fu ##cian ##ism , tao ##ism , legal ##ism and mo ##hism were founded , partly in response to the changing political world . [SEP]
[CLS] the first two philosophical thoughts would have an enormous influence on chinese culture . [SEP]
[CLS] after further political consolidation , seven prominent states remained by the end of the 5th century bc , and the years in which these few states battled each other are known as the warring states period . [SEP]
[CLS] though there remained a nominal zhou king until 256 bc , he was largely a figure ##head and held little real power . [SEP]
[CLS] numerous developments were made during this period in culture and mathematics . [SEP]
[CLS] examples include an important literary achievement , the zu ##o zhu ##an on the " spring and autumn annals " , which sum ##mar ##izes the preceding spring and autumn period , and the bundle of 21 bamboo slips from the ts ##ing ##hua collection , which was invented during this period dated to 305 bc , are the worlds ' earliest example of a two digit decimal multiplication table , indicating that sophisticated commercial arithmetic was already established during this period . [SEP]
[CLS] as neighboring territories of these warring states , including areas of modern sichuan and lia ##oning , were annexed , they were governed under the new local administrative system of commander ##y and prefecture . [SEP]
[CLS] this system had been in use since the spring and autumn period , and parts can still be seen in the modern system of sheng and xi ##an ( province and county ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the final expansion in this period began during the reign of ying zheng , the king of qin . [SEP]
[CLS] his unification of the other six powers , and further annexation ##s in the modern regions of zhejiang , fujian , guangdong and gu ##ang ##xi in 214 bc , enabled him to pro ##claim himself the first emperor ( qin shi huang ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the imperial china period can be divided into three sub - periods : early , middle , and late . [SEP]
[CLS] major events in the early sub - period include the qin unification of china and their replacement by the han , the first split followed by the jin unification , and the loss of north china . [SEP]
[CLS] the middle sub - period was marked by the sui unification and their supplement ##ation by the tang , the second split , and the song unification . [SEP]
[CLS] the late sub - period included the yuan , ming , and qing dynasties . [SEP]
[CLS] historians often refer to the period from the qin dynasty to the end of the qing dynasty as imperial china . [SEP]
[CLS] though the unified reign of the first qin emperor lasted only 12 years , he managed to sub ##due great parts of what constitutes the core of the han chinese homeland and to unite them under a tightly centralized legal ##ist government seated at xi ##any ##ang ( close to modern xi ' an ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the doctrine of legal ##ism that guided the qin emphasized strict adherence to a legal code and the absolute power of the emperor . [SEP]
[CLS] this philosophy , while effective for expanding the empire in a military fashion , proved un ##work ##able for governing it in peace ##time . [SEP]
[CLS] the qin emperor presided over the brutal si ##len ##cing of political opposition , including the event known as the burning of books and burying of scholars . [SEP]
[CLS] this would be the impetus behind the later han synthesis incorporating the more moderate schools of political governance . [SEP]
[CLS] major contributions of the qin include the concept of a centralized government , and the unification and development of the legal code , the written language , measurement , and currency of china after the tri ##bula ##tions of the spring and autumn and warring states periods . [SEP]
[CLS] even something as basic as the length of axle ##s for carts — which need to match ru ##ts in the roads — had to be made uniform to ensure a viable trading system throughout the empire . [SEP]
[CLS] also as part of its central ##ization , the qin connected the northern border walls of the states it defeated , making the first great wall of china . [SEP]
[CLS] the tribes of the north , collectively called the wu hu by the qin , were free from chinese rule during the majority of the dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] prohibited from trading with qin dynasty peasants , the xi ##ong ##nu tribe living in the or ##dos region in northwest china often raided them instead , prompting the qin to re ##tal ##iate . [SEP]
[CLS] after a military campaign led by general meng tian , the region was conquered in 215 bc and agriculture was established ; the peasants , however , were discontent ##ed and later revolt ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] the succeeding han dynasty also expanded into the or ##dos due to over ##pop ##ulation , but depleted their resources in the process . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , this was true of the dynasty ' s borders in multiple directions ; modern inner mongolia , xinjiang , tibet , manchu ##ria , and regions to the southeast were foreign to the qin , and even areas over which they had military control were culturally distinct . [SEP]
[CLS] as early as con ##fu ##cius and up until 1912 , there was reliance upon a trained intellectual elite , the " scholar - official " ( " scholar - gentlemen " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] they were civil servants appointed by the emperor to handle daily governance . [SEP]
[CLS] talented young men were selected through an elaborate process of imperial examination . [SEP]
[CLS] they had to demonstrate skill at call ##igraphy , and had to know con ##fu ##cian philosophy . [SEP]
