[CLS] with thousands of years of continuous history , china is one of the world ' s oldest civilizations , and is regarded as one of the cradle ##s of civilization . [SEP]
[CLS] the zhou dynasty ( 104 ##6 – 256 bc ) su ##pp ##lan ##ted the shang , and introduced the concept of the mandate of heaven to justify their rule . [SEP]
[CLS] the central zhou government began to weaken due to external and internal pressures in the 8th century bc , and the country eventually splinter ##ed into smaller states during the spring and autumn period . [SEP]
[CLS] in 221 bc , qin shi huang conquered the various warring states and created for himself the title of " huang ##di " or " emperor " of the qin , marking the beginning of imperial china . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the oppressive government fell soon after his death , and was su ##pp ##lan ##ted by the longer - lived han dynasty ( 206 bc – 220 ad ) . [SEP]
[CLS] china ' s last dynasty was the qing ( 1644 – 1912 ) , which was replaced by the republic of china in 1912 , and in the mainland by the people ' s republic of china in 1949 , resulting in two " de facto " states claiming to be the legitimate government of all china . [SEP]
[CLS] chinese history has alternate ##d between periods of political unity and peace , and periods of war and failed statehood – the most recent being the chinese civil war ( 1927 – 1949 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] between eras of multiple kingdoms and warlord ##ism , chinese dynasties have ruled parts or all of china ; in some eras control stretched as far as xinjiang and tibet , as at present . [SEP]
[CLS] traditional culture , and influences from other parts of asia and the western world ( carried by waves of immigration , cultural assimilation , expansion , and foreign contact ) , form the basis of the modern culture of china . [SEP]
[CLS] recent study shows that the stone tools found at xiao ##chang ##lian ##g site are magnet ##ost ##rat ##ig ##raphic ##ally dated to 1 . 36 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] the archaeological site of xi ##ho ##ud ##u in shan ##xi province has evidence of use of fire by " homo erect ##us " , which is dated 1 . 27 million years ago , and " homo erect ##us " fossils in china include the yuan ##mo ##u man , the lan ##tian man and the peking man . [SEP]
[CLS] in late neolithic times , the yellow river valley began to establish itself as a center of yang ##sha ##o culture ( 5000 bc to 3000 bc ) , and the first villages were founded ; the most archaeological ##ly significant of these was found at ban ##po , xi ' an . [SEP]
[CLS] bronze artifacts have been found at the maj ##ia ##ya ##o culture site ( between 310 ##0 and 270 ##0 bc ) , the bronze age is also represented at the lower xi ##aj ##iad ##ian culture ( 220 ##0 – 1600 bc ) site in northeast china . [SEP]
[CLS] san ##xing ##du ##i located in what is now sichuan province is believed to be the site of a major ancient city , of a previously unknown bronze age culture ( between 2000 and 1200 bc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] chinese archaeologists have identified the san ##xing ##du ##i culture to be part of the ancient kingdom of shu , linking the artifacts found at the site to its early legendary kings . [SEP]
[CLS] fe ##rro ##us metal ##lu ##rgy begins to appear in the late 6th century in the yang ##zi valley . [SEP]
[CLS] a bronze tom ##aha ##wk with a blade of meteor ##ic iron excavated near the city of gao ##cheng in shi ##jia ##zh ##uan ##g ( now he ##bei province ) has been dated to the 14th century bc . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , authors such as lia ##na chu ##a and mark elliott have used the term " iron age " by convention for the transitional period of c . 500 bc to 100 bc , roughly corresponding to the warring states period of chinese his ##tori ##ography . [SEP]
[CLS] an iron age culture of the tibetan plateau has tentatively been associated with the zhang zhu ##ng culture described in early tibetan writings . [SEP]
[CLS] the dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early bronze age sites at er ##lit ##ou , henan in 1959 . [SEP]
[CLS] with few clear records matching the shang oracle bones , it remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the xi ##a dynasty or of another culture from the same period . [SEP]
[CLS] early markings from this period found on pottery and shells are thought to be ancestral to modern chinese characters . [SEP]
[CLS] the second set , from the later shang or yin ( [UNK] ) period , is at anya ##ng , in modern - day henan , which has been confirmed as the last of the shang ' s nine capitals ( c . 1300 – 104 ##6 bc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the findings at anya ##ng include the earliest written record of the chinese so far discovered : inscriptions of di ##vina ##tion records in ancient chinese writing on the bones or shells of animals — the " oracle bones " , dating from around 125 ##0 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] the term yin dynasty has been synonymous with the shang dynasty in history , although it has lately been used to refer specifically to the latter half of the shang dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] chinese historians in later periods were accustomed to the notion of one dynasty succeeding another , but the political situation in early china was much more complicated . [SEP]
[CLS] hence , as some scholars of china suggest , the xi ##a and the shang can refer to political entities that existed concurrently , just as the early zhou existed at the same time as the shang . [SEP]
[CLS] although written records found at anya ##ng confirm the existence of the shang dynasty , western scholars are often hesitant to associate settlements that are con ##tem ##por ##aneous with the anya ##ng settlement with the shang dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] the evidence is inc ##on ##clusive in proving how far the shang realm extended from anya ##ng . [SEP]
[CLS] the leading hypothesis is that anya ##ng , ruled by the same shang in the official history , coe ##xi ##sted and traded with numerous other culturally diverse settlements in the area that is now referred to as china proper . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of the 2nd millennium bc , the zhou dynasty began to emerge in the yellow river valley , overrun ##ning the territory of the shang . [SEP]
[CLS] the zhou lived west of the shang , and the zhou leader was appointed western protector by the shang . [SEP]
[CLS] the king of zhou at this time invoked the concept of the mandate of heaven to leg ##iti ##mi ##ze his rule , a concept that was influential for almost every succeeding dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] like shang ##di , heaven ( " tian " ) ruled over all the other gods , and it decided who would rule china . [SEP]
[CLS] it was believed that a ruler lost the mandate of heaven when natural disasters occurred in great number , and when , more realistic ##ally , the sovereign had apparently lost his concern for the people . [SEP]
[CLS] in response , the royal house would be overthrow ##n , and a new house would rule , having been granted the mandate of heaven . [SEP]
[CLS] the zhou initially moved their capital west to an area near modern xi ' an , on the wei river , a tributary of the yellow river , but they would pre ##side over a series of expansion ##s into the yang ##tze river valley . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 8th century bc , power became decent ##ral ##ized during the spring and autumn period , named after the influential " spring and autumn annals " . [SEP]
[CLS] in this period , local military leaders used by the zhou began to assert their power and vie for he ##ge ##mony . [SEP]
[CLS] the situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest , such as the qin , forcing the zhou to move their capital east to lu ##oya ##ng . [SEP]
[CLS] in each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose , local strong ##men held most of the political power and continued their sub ##ser ##vie ##nce to the zhou kings in name only . [SEP]
[CLS] by the 6th century bc most small states had disappeared by being annexed and just a few large and powerful principal ##ities dominated china . [SEP]
[CLS] once all these powerful rulers had firmly established themselves within their respective dominion ##s , the blood ##shed focused more fully on interstate conflict in the warring states period , which began when the three remaining elite families in the jin state — zhao , wei and han — partition ##ed the state . [SEP]
[CLS] the hundred schools of thought of chinese philosophy blossom ##ed during this period , and such influential intellectual movements as con ##fu ##cian ##ism , tao ##ism , legal ##ism and mo ##hism were founded , partly in response to the changing political world . [SEP]
[CLS] after further political consolidation , seven prominent states remained by the end of the 5th century bc , and the years in which these few states battled each other are known as the warring states period . [SEP]
[CLS] though there remained a nominal zhou king until 256 bc , he was largely a figure ##head and held little real power . [SEP]
[CLS] examples include an important literary achievement , the zu ##o zhu ##an on the " spring and autumn annals " , which sum ##mar ##izes the preceding spring and autumn period , and the bundle of 21 bamboo slips from the ts ##ing ##hua collection , which was invented during this period dated to 305 bc , are the worlds ' earliest example of a two digit decimal multiplication table , indicating that sophisticated commercial arithmetic was already established during this period . [SEP]
[CLS] this system had been in use since the spring and autumn period , and parts can still be seen in the modern system of sheng and xi ##an ( province and county ) . [SEP]
[CLS] major events in the early sub - period include the qin unification of china and their replacement by the han , the first split followed by the jin unification , and the loss of north china . [SEP]
[CLS] the middle sub - period was marked by the sui unification and their supplement ##ation by the tang , the second split , and the song unification . [SEP]
[CLS] though the unified reign of the first qin emperor lasted only 12 years , he managed to sub ##due great parts of what constitutes the core of the han chinese homeland and to unite them under a tightly centralized legal ##ist government seated at xi ##any ##ang ( close to modern xi ' an ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the doctrine of legal ##ism that guided the qin emphasized strict adherence to a legal code and the absolute power of the emperor . [SEP]
[CLS] this philosophy , while effective for expanding the empire in a military fashion , proved un ##work ##able for governing it in peace ##time . [SEP]
[CLS] the qin emperor presided over the brutal si ##len ##cing of political opposition , including the event known as the burning of books and burying of scholars . [SEP]
[CLS] this would be the impetus behind the later han synthesis incorporating the more moderate schools of political governance . [SEP]
[CLS] major contributions of the qin include the concept of a centralized government , and the unification and development of the legal code , the written language , measurement , and currency of china after the tri ##bula ##tions of the spring and autumn and warring states periods . [SEP]
[CLS] even something as basic as the length of axle ##s for carts — which need to match ru ##ts in the roads — had to be made uniform to ensure a viable trading system throughout the empire . [SEP]
[CLS] also as part of its central ##ization , the qin connected the northern border walls of the states it defeated , making the first great wall of china . [SEP]
[CLS] the tribes of the north , collectively called the wu hu by the qin , were free from chinese rule during the majority of the dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] after a military campaign led by general meng tian , the region was conquered in 215 bc and agriculture was established ; the peasants , however , were discontent ##ed and later revolt ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] the succeeding han dynasty also expanded into the or ##dos due to over ##pop ##ulation , but depleted their resources in the process . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , this was true of the dynasty ' s borders in multiple directions ; modern inner mongolia , xinjiang , tibet , manchu ##ria , and regions to the southeast were foreign to the qin , and even areas over which they had military control were culturally distinct . [SEP]
