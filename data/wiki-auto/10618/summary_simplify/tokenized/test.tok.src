[CLS] for example , fiddle ##s may optional ##ly be set up with a bridge with a flat ##ter arch to reduce the range of bow - arm motion needed for techniques such as the double shuffle , a form of bari ##ola ##ge involving rapid alter ##nation between pairs of adjacent strings . [SEP]
[CLS] the fiddle is part of many traditional ( folk ) styles , which are typically aura ##l traditions — taught ' by ear ' rather than via written music . [SEP]
[CLS] fi ##ddling is also open to improvisation and em ##bell ##ishment with or ##name ##ntation at the player ' s discretion — in contrast to orchestral performances , which adhere to the composer ' s notes to reproduce a work faithful ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] the first recorded reference to the bowed li ##ra was in the 9th century by the persian geo ##grapher ibn k ##hur ##rada ##dh ##bi ##h ( d . 911 ) ; in his lexi ##co ##graphic ##al discussion of instruments he cited the li ##ra ( lu ##ra ) as a typical instrument of the byzantine ##s and equivalent to the ra ##ba ##b played in the islamic empires . [SEP]
[CLS] over the centuries , europe continued to have two distinct types of fiddle ##s : one , relatively square - shaped , held in the arms , became known as the viola da bra ##cci ##o ( " arm vi ##ol " ) family and evolved into the violin ; the other , with sloping shoulders and held between the knees , was the viola da ga ##mba ( " leg vi ##ol " ) group . [SEP]
[CLS] during the renaissance the ga ##mba ##s were important and elegant instruments ; they eventually lost ground to the louder ( and originally less aristocratic ) " viola da bra ##cci ##o " family . [SEP]
[CLS] the etymology of " fiddle " is uncertain : the germanic " fiddle " may derive from the same early romance word as does " violin " , or it may be native ##ly germanic . [SEP]
[CLS] a native germanic ancestor of " fiddle " might even be the ancestor of the early romance form of " violin " . [SEP]
[CLS] like the violin , it tended to have four strings , but came in a variety of shapes and sizes . [SEP]
[CLS] another family of instruments that contributed to the development of the modern fiddle are the vi ##ols , which are held between the legs and played vertically , and have fr ##ette ##d finger ##boards . [SEP]
[CLS] in performance , a solo fiddle ##r , or one or two with a group of other instrumentalist ##s , is the norm , though twin fi ##ddling is represented in some north american , scandinavian , scottish and irish styles . [SEP]
[CLS] following the folk revival ##s of the second half of the 20th century , however , it has become common for less formal situations to find large groups of fiddle ##rs playing together — see for example the calgary fiddle ##rs , swedish sp ##elman ##sl ##ag folk - musician clubs , and the worldwide phenomenon of irish sessions . [SEP]
[CLS] these contrasting traditions may be vest ##ige ##s of historical performance settings : large concert halls where violins were played required more instruments , before electronic amp ##li ##fication , than did more intimate dance halls and houses that fiddle ##rs played in . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , the majority of fiddle music was dance music , while violin music had either grown out of dance music or was something else entirely . [SEP]
[CLS] in situations that required greater volume , a fiddle ##r ( as long as they kept the beat ) could push their instrument harder than could a violinist . [SEP]
[CLS] in the very late 20th century , a few artists have successfully attempted a reconstruction of the scottish tradition of violin and " big fiddle , " or cello . [SEP]
[CLS] notable recorded examples include iain fraser and christine hanson , amelia kam ##inski and christine hanson ' s bonnie lass ##es , ala ##sd ##air fraser and natalie haas ' fire and grace . , and tim macdonald and jeremy ward ' s " the wild ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] hungarian , slovenian , and romanian fiddle players are often accompanied by a three - string ##ed variant of the viola — known as the " ko ##nt ##ra " — and by double bass , with ci ##mba ##lom and clarinet being less standard yet still common additions to a band . [SEP]
[CLS] to a greater extent than classical violin playing , fiddle playing is characterized by a huge variety of ethnic or folk music traditions , each of which has its own distinctive sound . [SEP]
[CLS] american fi ##ddling , a broad category including traditional and modern styles [SEP]
[CLS] fi ##ddling remains popular in canada , and the various home ##gr ##own styles of canadian fi ##ddling are seen as an important part of the country ' s cultural identity , as celebrated during the opening ceremony of the vancouver 2010 winter olympics . [SEP]
