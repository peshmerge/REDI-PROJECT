[CLS] he ##pha ##est ##us is probably associated with the linear b ( my ##cene ##an greek ) inscription , " a - pa - i - ti - jo " , found at kn ##oss ##os ; the inscription indirectly at ##test ##s his worship at that time because it is believed that it reads the theo ##ph ##oric name " ha ##pha ##ist ##ios " or " ha ##pha ##ist ##ion " .

[CLS] the theme of the " return of he ##pha ##est ##us " , popular among the attic vase - painters whose ware ##s were favored among the et ##rus ##cans , may have introduced this theme to et ##ru ##ria . [SEP]
