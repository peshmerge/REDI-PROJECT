[CLS] the greeks maintained in their civilization an an ##imi ##stic idea that statues are in some sense alive . [SEP]
[CLS] this kind of art and the an ##imi ##stic belief goes back to the min ##oa ##n period , when da ##eda ##lus , the builder of the labyrinth , made images which moved of their own accord . [SEP]
[CLS] a statue of the god was somehow the god himself , and the image on a man ' s tomb indicated somehow his presence . [SEP]
[CLS] in the account of attic vase painters , he ##pha ##est ##us was present at the birth of athena and wi ##eld ##s the axe with which he split zeus ' head to free her . [SEP]
[CLS] in the latter account , he ##pha ##est ##us is there represented as older than athena , so the mythology of he ##pha ##est ##us is inconsistent in this respect . [SEP]

[CLS] the other gods begged he ##pha ##est ##us to return to olympus to let her go , but he refused , saying " i have no mother " . [SEP]
[CLS] at last , dion ##ys ##us fetch ##ed him , into ##xi ##cated him with wine , and took the subdued smith back to olympus on the back of a mule accompanied by rev ##ele ##rs – a scene that sometimes appears on painted pottery of attic ##a and of co ##rin ##th . [SEP]
[CLS] in the painted scenes , the padded dancers and ph ##all ##ic figures of the dion ##ys ##an th ##rong leading the mule show that the procession was a part of the di ##thy ##ram ##bic celebrations that were the forerunner ##s of the sat ##yr plays of fifth century athens . [SEP]
[CLS] the theme of the " return of he ##pha ##est ##us " , popular among the attic vase - painters whose ware ##s were favored among the et ##rus ##cans , may have introduced this theme to et ##ru ##ria . [SEP]
[CLS] in the vase - painters ' portrayal of the procession , he ##pha ##est ##us was mounted on a mule or a horse , with dion ##ys ##us holding the br ##id ##le and carrying he ##pha ##est ##us ' tools ( including a double - headed axe ) . [SEP]

[CLS] however , in book xvi ##ii of homer ' s " il ##iad " , the consort of he ##pha ##est ##us is a lesser ap ##hr ##od ##ite , char ##is ( " the grace " ) or ag ##lai ##a ( " the glorious " ) – the youngest of the grace ##s , as he ##sio ##d calls her . [SEP]
[CLS] in athens , there is a temple of he ##pha ##est ##us , the " he ##pha ##est ##eum " ( mis ##cal ##led the " these ##um " ) near the ago ##ra . [SEP]

[CLS] the roman myth ##ographer h ##y ##gin ##us records a similar story in which he ##pha ##est ##us demanded zeus to let him marry athena since he was the one who had smashed open zeus ' s skull , allowing athena to be born . [SEP]
[CLS] zeus agreed to this and he ##pha ##est ##us and athena were married , but , when he ##pha ##est ##us was about to con ##sum ##mate the union , athena vanished from the br ##idal bed , causing him to e ##ja ##cula ##te on the floor , thus imp ##re ##gna ##ting ga ##ia with erich ##th ##oni ##us . [SEP]
[CLS] on the island of le ##m ##nos , he ##pha ##est ##us ' consort was the sea ny ##mp ##h cab ##eiro , by whom he was the father of two metal ##working gods named the cab ##ei ##ri . [SEP]
[CLS] in sicily , his consort was the ny ##mp ##h ae ##t ##na , and his sons were two gods of sicilian ge ##yse ##rs called pali ##ci . [SEP]
[CLS] with tha ##lia , he ##pha ##est ##us was sometimes considered the father of the pali ##ci . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##pha ##est ##us father ##ed several children with mortals and immortals alike . [SEP]
[CLS] one of those children was the robber per ##ip ##het ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] though married to he ##pha ##est ##us , ap ##hr ##od ##ite had an affair with ares , the god of war . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , he ##pha ##est ##us discovered ap ##hr ##od ##ite ’ s affair through he ##lio ##s , the all - seeing sun , and planned a trap during one of their try ##sts . [SEP]
[CLS] while ap ##hr ##od ##ite and ares lay together in bed , he ##pha ##est ##us en ##s ##nare ##d them in an un ##break ##able chain - link net so small as to be invisible and dragged them to mount olympus to shame them in front of the other gods for retribution . [SEP]

[CLS] the the ##ban ##s told that the union of ares and ap ##hr ##od ##ite produced harmon ##ia . [SEP]
[CLS] however , of the union of he ##pha ##est ##us with ap ##hr ##od ##ite , there was no issue unless virgil was serious when he said that er ##os was their child . [SEP]
[CLS] later authors explain this statement by saying that er ##os was sired by ares but passed off to he ##pha ##est ##us as his own son . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##pha ##est ##us was somehow connected with the archaic , pre - greek ph ##ry ##gia ##n and th ##rac ##ian mystery cult of the ka ##bei ##roi , who were also called the " he ##pha ##isto ##i " , " the he ##pha ##est ##us - men " , in le ##m ##nos . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the three le ##m ##nian tribes also called themselves he ##pha ##est ##ion and claimed direct descent from the god . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##pha ##est ##us is to the male gods as athena is to the females , for he gives skill to mortal artists and was believed to have taught men the arts alongside athena . [SEP]
[CLS] he was nevertheless believed to be far inferior to the sublime character of athena . [SEP]
[CLS] at athens they had temples and festivals in common . [SEP]
[CLS] both were believed to have great healing powers , and le ##m ##nian earth ( terra le ##m ##nia ) from the spot on which he ##pha ##est ##us had fallen was believed to cure madness , the bites of snakes , and ha ##em ##or ##rh ##age , and priests of he ##pha ##est ##us knew how to cure wounds inflicted by snakes .

[CLS] he was represented in the temple of athena cha ##lc ##io ##ec ##us ( athena of the bronze house ) at sparta , in the act of delivering his mother ; on the chest of cy ##pse ##lus , giving achilles ' s armour to the ##tis ; and at athens there was the famous statue of he ##pha ##est ##us by al ##cam ##enes , in which his lame ##ness was only subtly portrayed . [SEP]
[CLS] the greeks frequently placed small dwarf - like statues of he ##pha ##est ##us near their hearth ##s , and these figures are the oldest of all his representations . [SEP]
[CLS] during the best period of gr ##ec ##ian art he was represented as a vigorous man with a beard , and is characterized by his hammer or some other craft ##ing tool , his oval cap , and the chi ##ton . [SEP]
[CLS] athena is sometimes thought to be " the ‘ soul - mate ’ of he ##pha ##est ##us . [SEP]
[CLS] yet a kind of cloudy mysterious ##ness sh ##roud ##s their relationship ; no single tradition was ever clearly established on this subject , and so what confronts us is a blurred image based on rumors and conflicting reports . " [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , he " seeks imp ##et ##uously and passionate ##ly to make love to athena : at the moment of climax she pushes him aside , and his se ##men falls to the earth where it imp ##re ##gna ##tes ga ##ia . " [SEP]
[CLS] he ##pha ##est ##us was associated by greek colonists in southern italy with the volcano gods ad ##ran ##us ( of mount et ##na ) and vulcan ##us of the lip ##ari islands . [SEP]
[CLS] the first - century sage apollo ##nius of ty ##ana is said to have observed , " there are many other mountains all over the earth that are on fire , and yet we should never be done with it if we assigned to them giants and gods like he ##pha ##est ##us " . [SEP]
[CLS] in the trojan war , he ##pha ##est ##us sided with the greeks , but was also worship ##ed by the trojan ##s and saved one of their men from being killed by di ##ome ##des . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##pha ##est ##us ’ favourite place in the mortal world was the island of le ##m ##nos , where he liked to dwell among the sin ##tian ##s , but he also frequented other volcanic islands such as lip ##ara , hi ##era , im ##bro ##s and sicily , which were called his ab ##odes or workshops . [SEP]
[CLS] the epithet ##s and surname ##s by which he ##pha ##est ##us is known by the poets generally all ##ude to his skill in the plastic arts or to his figure or lame ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] the greeks frequently placed small dwarf - like statues of he ##pha ##est ##us near their hearth ##s , and these figures are the oldest of all his representations . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##pha ##est ##us was sometimes portrayed as a vigorous man with a beard and was characterized by his hammer or some other craft ##ing tool , his oval cap , and the chi ##ton . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##pha ##est ##us is described in mythological sources as " lame " , and " halt ##ing " . [SEP]
[CLS] he was depicted with crippled feet and as miss ##ha ##pen , either from birth or as a result of his fall from olympus . [SEP]
[CLS] in vase paintings , he ##pha ##est ##us is usually shown lame and bent over his an ##vil , hard at work on a metal creation , and sometimes with his feet back - to - front : " he ##pha ##isto ##s amp ##hi ##gy ##ee ##is " . [SEP]
[CLS] he walked with the aid of a stick . [SEP]
[CLS] the ar ##gon ##au ##t pal ##ai ##mon ##ius , " son of he ##pha ##est ##us " ( i . e . a bronze - smith ) was also lame . [SEP]
[CLS] other " sons of he ##pha ##est ##us " were the cab ##ei ##ri on the island of sam ##oth ##race , who were identified with the crab ( " ka ##rkin ##os " ) by the lexi ##co ##grapher he ##sy ##chi ##us . [SEP]
[CLS] the adjective " ka ##rkin ##op ##ous " ( " crab - footed " ) sign ##ified " lame " , according to det ##ien ##ne and ve ##rna ##nt . [SEP]
[CLS] the cab ##ei ##ri were also lame . [SEP]
[CLS] in some myths , he ##pha ##est ##us built himself a " wheeled chair " or chariot with which to move around , thus helping him overcome his lame ##ness while demonstrating his skill to the other gods . [SEP]
[CLS] in the " il ##iad " 18 . 37 ##1 , it is stated that he ##pha ##est ##us built twenty bronze wheeled trip ##ods to assist him in moving around . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##pha ##est ##us ’ s ugly appearance and lame ##ness is taken by some to represent peripheral ne ##uro ##pathy and skin cancer resulting from arsenic ##osis caused by arsenic exposure from metal ##working . [SEP]
[CLS] bronze age smith ##s added arsenic to copper to produce harder arsenic ##al bronze , especially during periods of tin scar ##city . [SEP]
[CLS] many bronze age smith ##s would have suffered from chronic arsenic poisoning as a result of their livelihood . [SEP]
[CLS] consequently , the myth ##ic image of the lame smith is widespread . [SEP]
[CLS] as he ##pha ##est ##us was an iron - age smith , not a bronze - age smith , the connection is one from ancient folk memory . [SEP]
[CLS] the minor planet 221 ##2 he ##pha ##isto ##s discovered in 1978 by soviet astronomer l ##yu ##dm ##ila cher ##ny ##kh was named in he ##pha ##est ##us ' honour . [SEP]
