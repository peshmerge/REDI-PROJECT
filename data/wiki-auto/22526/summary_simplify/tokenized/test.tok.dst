[CLS] organ ##ome ##tal ##lic chemistry is the study of organ ##ome ##tal ##lic compounds , chemical compounds containing at least one chemical bond between a carbon atom of an organic molecule and a metal , including al ##kali ##ne , al ##kali ##ne earth , and transition metals , and sometimes broad ##ened to include metal ##loid ##s like bo ##ron , silicon , and tin , as well . [SEP]
[CLS] aside from bonds to organ ##yl fragments or molecules , bonds to ' inorganic ' carbon , like carbon mono ##xide ( metal carbon ##yl ##s ) , cy ##ani ##de , or car ##bid ##e , are generally considered to be organ ##ome ##tal ##lic as well . [SEP]
[CLS] some related compounds such as transition metal h ##yd ##ride ##s and metal ph ##os ##phine complexes are often included in discussions of organ ##ome ##tal ##lic compounds , though strictly speaking , they are not necessarily organ ##ome ##tal ##lic . [SEP]
[CLS] the related but distinct term " metal ##org ##ani ##c compound " refers to metal - containing compounds lacking direct metal - carbon bonds but which contain organic ligand ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the field of organ ##ome ##tal ##lic chemistry combines aspects of traditional inorganic and organic chemistry . [SEP]
[CLS] organ ##ome ##tal ##lic compounds are widely used both st ##oic ##hi ##ometric ##ally in research and industrial chemical reactions , as well as in the role of catalyst ##s to increase the rates of such reactions ( e . g . , as in uses of homogeneous cat ##aly ##sis ) , where target molecules include polymers , pharmaceuticals , and many other types of practical products . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to the traditional metals , lan ##than ##ides , act ##ini ##des , and semi ##met ##als , elements such as bo ##ron , silicon , arsenic , and se ##len ##ium are considered to form organ ##ome ##tal ##lic compounds , e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] many complexes feature coordination bonds between a metal and organic ligand ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the organic ligand ##s often bind the metal through a het ##ero ##ato ##m such as oxygen or nitrogen , in which case such compounds are considered coordination compounds . [SEP]
[CLS] however , if any of the ligand ##s form a direct m - c bond , then complex is usually considered to be organ ##ome ##tal ##lic , e . g . , ( ch ) ru ( ho ) . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , many lip ##op ##hil ##ic compounds such as metal ace ##ty ##lace ##ton ##ates and metal al ##ko ##xide ##s are called " metal ##org ##ani ##cs . " [SEP]
[CLS] ill ##ust ##rative of the many functions of the b - dependent enzymes , the mt ##r enzyme cat ##aly ##zes the transfer of a methyl group from a nitrogen on n ##5 - methyl - te ##tra ##hy ##dro ##fo ##late to the sulfur of homo ##cy ##stein ##e to produce met ##hi ##oni ##ne . [SEP]
[CLS] the status of compounds in which the canonical an ##ion has a del ##oca ##lized structure in which the negative charge is shared with an atom more electron ##ega ##tive than carbon , as in en ##olate ##s , may vary with the nature of the an ##ion ##ic moi ##ety , the metal ion , and possibly the medium ; in the absence of direct structural evidence for a carbon – metal bond , such compounds are not considered to be organ ##ome ##tal ##lic . [SEP]
[CLS] for highly electro ##po ##sit ##ive elements , such as lithium and sodium , the carbon ligand exhibits car ##ban ##ion ##ic character , but free carbon - based an ##ions are extremely rare , an example being cy ##ani ##de . [SEP]
[CLS] as in other areas of chemistry , electron counting is useful for organizing organ ##ome ##tal ##lic chemistry . [SEP]
[CLS] the 18 - electron rule is helpful in predicting the stab ##ili ##ties of metal carbon ##yl ##s and related compounds . [SEP]
[CLS] most organ ##ome ##tal ##lic compounds do not however follow the 18 ##e rule . [SEP]
[CLS] chemical bonding and react ##ivity in organ ##ome ##tal ##lic compounds is often discussed from the perspective of the iso ##lo ##bal principle . [SEP]
[CLS] the dynamic properties of organ ##ome ##tal ##lic compounds is often probe ##d with variable - temperature nm ##r and chemical kinetic ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] early developments in organ ##ome ##tal ##lic chemistry include louis claude cadet ' s synthesis of methyl arsenic compounds related to ca ##co ##dy ##l , william christopher ze ##ise ' s platinum - et ##hyl ##ene complex , edward frank ##land ' s discovery of diet ##hyl - and dime ##thy ##lz ##in ##c , ludwig mon ##d ' s discovery of ni ( co ) , and victor gr ##ign ##ard ' s organ ##oma ##gne ##si ##um compounds .

[CLS] ( though not always acknowledged as an organ ##ome ##tal ##lic compound , prussian blue , a mixed - vale ##nce iron - cy ##ani ##de complex , was first prepared in 170 ##6 by paint maker johann jacob dies ##bach as the first coordination polymer and synthetic material containing a metal - carbon bond . ) [SEP]
[CLS] the abundant and diverse products from coal and petroleum led to z ##ieg ##ler – nat ##ta , fischer – tr ##ops ##ch , hydro ##form ##yla ##tion cat ##aly ##sis which employ co , h , and al ##ken ##es as feeds ##tock ##s and ligand ##s . [SEP]

[CLS] organ ##ome ##tal ##lic compounds find wide use in commercial reactions , both as homogeneous cat ##aly ##sis and as st ##oic ##hi ##ometric re ##age ##nts for instance , organ ##oli ##thi ##um , organ ##oma ##gne ##si ##um , and organ ##oa ##lum ##inium compounds , examples of which are highly basic and highly reducing , are useful st ##oic ##hi ##ometric ##ally , but also cat ##aly ##ze many polymer ##ization reactions .
