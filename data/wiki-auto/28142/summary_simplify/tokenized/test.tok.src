[CLS] the large size and low density of super ##cl ##ust ##ers means they , unlike clusters , expand with the hub ##ble expansion . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of super ##cl ##ust ##ers in the ob ##ser ##vable universe is estimated to be 10 million . [SEP]
[CLS] the existence of super ##cl ##ust ##ers indicates that the galaxies in the universe are not uniformly distributed ; most of them are drawn together in groups and clusters , with groups containing up to some dozens of galaxies and clusters up to several thousand galaxies . [SEP]
[CLS] those groups and clusters and additional isolated galaxies in turn form even larger structures called super ##cl ##ust ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] super ##cl ##ust ##ers form massive structures of galaxies , called " fi ##lam ##ents " , " super ##cl ##ust ##er complexes " , " walls " or " sheets " , that may span between several hundred million light - years to 10 billion light - years , covering more than 5 % of the ob ##ser ##vable universe . [SEP]
[CLS] observations of super ##cl ##ust ##ers can give information about the initial condition of the universe , when these super ##cl ##ust ##ers were created . [SEP]
[CLS] the directions of the rotational axes of galaxies within super ##cl ##ust ##ers may also give insight and information into the early formation process of galaxies in the history of the universe . [SEP]
[CLS] although super ##cl ##ust ##ers are supposed to be the largest structures in the universe , according to the co ##smo ##logical principle , larger structures have been observed in surveys , perhaps most notably the sloan great wall . [SEP]
