The large size and low density of superclusters means they, unlike clusters, expand with the Hubble expansion.
The number of superclusters in the observable universe is estimated to be 10 million.
The existence of superclusters indicates that the galaxies in the Universe are not uniformly distributed; most of them are drawn together in groups and clusters, with groups containing up to some dozens of galaxies and clusters up to several thousand galaxies.
Those groups and clusters and additional isolated galaxies in turn form even larger structures called superclusters.
Superclusters form massive structures of galaxies, called "filaments", "supercluster complexes", "walls" or "sheets", that may span between several hundred million light-years to 10 billion light-years, covering more than 5% of the observable universe.
Observations of superclusters can give information about the initial condition of the universe, when these superclusters were created.
The directions of the rotational axes of galaxies within superclusters may also give insight and information into the early formation process of galaxies in the history of the Universe.
Although superclusters are supposed to be the largest structures in the universe, according to the Cosmological principle, larger structures have been observed in surveys, perhaps most notably the sloan great wall.
