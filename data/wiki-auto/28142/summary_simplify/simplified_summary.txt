the large size and low density of superclusters means they , unlike clusters , expand with the expansion .
the number of superclusters in the observable universe is about 10 million .
groups have some dozens of galaxies and clusters up to several thousand galaxies .
those groups and clusters plus more isolated galaxies form even larger structures called superclusters .
superclusters form massive structures of galaxies , called " filaments " , " supercluster complexes " , " walls " or " sheets " , that may span between several hundred million light-years to 10 billion light-years , covering more than 5 % of the observable universe .
superclusters can give information about the first condition of the universe when these superclusters were created .
the directions of the rotational axes of galaxies within superclusters may also give insight and information into the early formation process of galaxies in the history of the universe .
although superclusters are supposed to be the largest structures in the universe , according to the cosmological principle , larger structures have been observed in surveys , perhaps most notably the sloan great wall .
