a supercluster is a large group of smaller galaxy groups or galaxy groups .
the milky way is part of the local group galaxy group galaxies .
the large size and low density of superclusters means they , unlike clusters , expand with the expansion .
the number of superclusters in the observable universe is about 10 million .
groups have some dozens of galaxies and clusters up to several thousand galaxies .
those groups and clusters plus more isolated galaxies form even larger structures called superclusters .
their existence was first proposed by george abell in his 1958 abell catalogue of galaxy clusters .
he called them " second-order clusters " , or clusters of clusters .
superclusters form massive structures of galaxies , called " filaments " , " supercluster complexes " , " walls " or " sheets " , that may span between several hundred million light-years to 10 billion light-years , covering more than 5 % of the observable universe .
these are the largest known structures ever found .
superclusters can give information about the first condition of the universe when these superclusters were created .
the directions of the rotational axes of galaxies within superclusters may also give insight and information into the early formation process of galaxies in the history of the universe .
there are gaps in space where few galaxies exist .
superclusters are often divided into groups of clusters called galaxy groups and clusters .
although superclusters are supposed to be the largest structures in the universe , according to the cosmological principle , larger structures have been observed in surveys , perhaps most notably the sloan great wall .
