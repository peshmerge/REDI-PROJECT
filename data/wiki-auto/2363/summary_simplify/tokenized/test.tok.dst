[CLS] he is generally said to have been a pupil of giacomo car ##iss ##imi in rome , and some theo ##rize that he had some connection with northern italy because his early works seem to show the influence of st ##rade ##lla and leg ##ren ##zi . [SEP]
[CLS] the production at rome of his opera " g ##li e ##qui ##vo ##ci ne ##l se ##mb ##ian ##te " ( 1679 ) gained him the support of queen christina of sweden ( who at the time was living in rome ) , and he became her " maestro di cappella " . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 168 ##4 he became " maestro di cappella " to the viceroy of naples , perhaps through the influence of his sister , an opera singer , who might have been the mistress of an influential ne ##ap ##oli ##tan noble . [SEP]
[CLS] in the interval he enjoyed the patronage of ferdinand ##o de ' medici , for whose private theatre near florence he composed operas , and of cardinal otto ##bon ##i , who made him his " maestro di cappella " , and pro ##cured him a similar post at the basilica di santa maria mag ##gio ##re in rome in 1703 . [SEP]
[CLS] by this time naples seems to have become tired of his music ; the romans , however , appreciated it better , and it was at the teatro cap ##rani ##ca in rome that he produced some of his finest operas ( " tel ##ema ##co " , 1718 ; " marco at ##ti ##lio reg ##olo " , 1719 ; " la gr ##ise ##lda " , 1721 ) , as well as some noble specimens of church music , including a " mess ##a di santa cecilia " for chorus and orchestra , composed in honor of saint cecilia for cardinal francesco ac ##qua ##vi ##va in 1721 . [SEP]
[CLS] his last work on a large scale appears to have been the unfinished " er ##mini ##a " serena ##ta for the marriage of the prince of st ##ig ##lian ##o in 1723 . [SEP]
[CLS] scar ##lat ##ti ' s music forms an important link between the early baroque italian vocal styles of the 17th century , with their centers in florence , venice and rome , and the classical school of the 18th century . [SEP]
[CLS] scar ##lat ##ti ' s style , however , is more than a transitional element in western music ; like most of his naples colleagues he shows an almost modern understanding of the psychology of modulation and also frequently makes use of the ever - changing phrase lengths so typical of the napoli school . [SEP]
[CLS] his early operas — " g ##li e ##qui ##vo ##ci ne ##l se ##mb ##ian ##te " 1679 ; " l ' honest ##a ne ##gli amor ##i " 1680 , containing the famous aria " gia il sole dal gang ##e " ; " il po ##mp ##eo " 1683 , containing the well - known airs " o ce ##ssa ##te di pia ##gar ##mi " and " to ##gli ##ete ##mi la vita an ##cor , " and others down to about 1685 — retain the older cadence ##s in their rec ##itative ##s , and a considerable variety of neatly constructed forms in their charming little arias , accompanied sometimes by the string quartet , treated with careful el ##ab ##oration , sometimes with the con ##tin ##uo alone . [SEP]
[CLS] by 168 ##6 , he had definitely established the " italian overture " form ( second edition of " dal male il ben ##e " ) , and had abandoned the ground bass and the binary form air in two stanza ##s in favour of the ter ##nary form or da cap ##o type of air . [SEP]
[CLS] from about 1697 onwards ( " la cad ##uta del dec ##em ##vir ##i " ) , influenced partly perhaps by the style of giovanni bono ##nc ##ini and probably more by the taste of the vice ##re ##gal court , his opera arias become more conventional and commonplace in rhythm , while his scoring is hasty and crude , yet not without brilliance ( " l ' era ##cle ##a " , 1700 ) , the oboe ##s and trumpets being frequently used , and the violins often playing in unison . [SEP]
[CLS] the later ne ##ap ##oli ##tan operas ( " l ' amor vol ##ub ##ile e ti ##ran ##no " 1709 ; " la pri ##nc ##ipes ##sa fed ##ele " 1710 ; " ti ##gra ##ne " , 1714 , & c . ) are show ##y and effective rather than profoundly emotional ; the instrumentation marks a great advance on previous work , since the main duty of accompanying the voice is thrown upon the string quartet , the harpsichord being reserved exclusively for the noisy instrumental " ri ##tor ##nell ##i " . [SEP]
[CLS] his last group of operas , composed for rome , exhibit a deeper poetic feeling , a broad and dig ##nified style of melody , a strong dramatic sense , especially in accompanied rec ##itative ##s , a device which he himself had been the first to use as early as 168 ##6 ( " ol ##im ##pia ve ##ndi ##cat ##a " ) and a much more modern style of orchestra ##tion , the horns appearing for the first time , and being treated with striking effect . [SEP]
[CLS] these represent the most intellectual type of chamber - music of their period , and it is to be regretted that they have remained almost entirely in manuscript , since a careful study of them is ind ##is ##pen ##sable to anyone who wishes to form an adequate idea of scar ##lat ##ti ' s development . [SEP]
[CLS] his few remaining masses ( the story of his having composed two hundred is hardly credible ) and church music in general are comparatively un ##im ##port ##ant , except the great " st cecilia mass " ( 1721 ) , which is one of the first attempts at the style which reached its height in the great masses of johann sebastian bach and ludwig van beethoven .
