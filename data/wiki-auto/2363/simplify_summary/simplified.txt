alessandro scarlatti -lrb- may 2,1660 – october 22,1725 -rrb- was an italian baroque composer .
he is considered the founder of the neapolitan school of opera .
he was the father of the famous composer domenico scarlatti .
scarlatti was born in palermo , italy .
he was a pupil of giacomo carissimi in rome .
he became her " maestro di cappella " .
in february 1684 he became maestro di cappella to the viceroy of naples .
here he produced a long series of operas .
in 1702 scarlatti left naples and did not return until the spanish domination had been replaced by that of the austrians .
in the interval he enjoyed the patronage of ferdinando de ' medici , for whose private theatre near florence he composed operas , and of cardinal ottoboni , who made him his " maestro di cappella " , and obtained him a similar post at the basilica di santa maria maggiore in rome in 1703 .
after visiting venice and urbino in 1707 , scarlatti took up his duties in naples again in 1708 , and stayed there until 1717 .
naples seems to have become tired of his music ; the romans , however , appreciated it better , and it was at the teatro capranica in rome that he produced some of his best works in the church .
his last work on a large scale was the unfinished " erminia " serenata for the marriage of the prince of stigliano in 1723 .
he died in naples .
scarlatti 's music forms an important link between the early baroque italian vocal styles of the 17th century , with their centers in florence , venice and rome , and the classical school of the 18th century .
scarlatti 's style is more than a transitional element in western music .
his early operas , " gli equivoci nel sembiante " 1679 , " l ' honesta negli amori " 1680 , containing the famous aria " gia il sole dal gange " , " il pompeo " 1683 , containing the well-known airs " o cessate di di piagarmi " and " el peru " , together with the many of the quartets , were often made up by the string quartets , together , together with theunciation of the fine music of the " lagli quabuomi " .
by 1686 , he had definitely established the " italian overture " form buddhism .
his best operas of this period are " la rosaura " gogh , printed by the gesellschaft fur musikforschung ɔ , and " pirro e demetrio " 1694 utc .
from about 1697 onwards , " la caduta del decemviri " birmingham , influenced partly perhaps by the style of giovanni bononcini .
the operas composed for ferdinando de ' medici are lost .
" mitridate eupatore " , composed for venice in 1707 , contains music far in advance of anything that scarlatti had written for naples , both in technique and in intellectual power .
the later neapolitan operas are very important , since the main duty of the harpsichord is thrown on the string quartet , since the main duty of the harpsichord is thrown on the string quartet .
in his opera " teodora " , 1697 – 746 he originated the use of the orchestral " ritornello " .
his last group of operas , composed for rome , show a deeper poetic feeling , a broad and dignified style of melody , especially in accompanied recitatives .
" la maddalena " , 1685 ; " la giuditta " , 1693 ; " christmas oratorio " , c . 1705 ; " s . filippo neri " , 1714 ; and others , are composed for a very small number of cantatas .
it is to be regretted that they have remained almost entirely in manuscript .
his other masses , the story of his having composed two hundred is hardly credible globally , and church music in general are comparatively unimportant , except the great " st cecilia mass " liszt compositions .
his instrumental music , though not without interest , is curiously antiquated as compared with his vocal works .
