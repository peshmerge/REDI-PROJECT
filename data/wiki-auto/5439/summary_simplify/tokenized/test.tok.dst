[CLS] its name is latin for " horned goat " or " goat horn " or " having horns like a goat ' s " , and it is commonly represented in the form of a sea - goat : a mythical creature that is half goat , half fish . [SEP]
[CLS] cap ##ric ##orn ##us is one of the 88 modern constellation ##s , and was also one of the 48 constellation ##s listed by the 2nd century astronomer claudius ptolemy . [SEP]
[CLS] the constellation is located in an area of sky called the sea or the water , consisting of many water - related constellation ##s such as aqua ##rius , pi ##sc ##es and er ##ida ##nus . [SEP]
[CLS] cap ##ric ##orn ##us is a faint constellation , with only one star above magnitude 3 ; its alpha star has a magnitude of only 3 . 6 . [SEP]
[CLS] the brightest star in cap ##ric ##orn ##us is δ cap ##ric ##orn ##i , also called den ##eb al ##ged ##i , with a magnitude of 2 . 9 , located 39 light - years from earth . [SEP]
[CLS] like several other stars such as den ##eb ##ola and den ##eb , it is named for the arabic word for " tail " ( " den ##eb " ) ; its traditional name means " the tail of the goat " . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary ( α cap ) , 109 light - years from earth , is a yellow - hue ##d giant star of magnitude 3 . 6 ; the secondary ( α cap ) , 690 light - years from earth , is a yellow - hue ##d super ##gia ##nt star of magnitude 4 . 3 . [SEP]
[CLS] also called al ##ged ##i or gi ##ed ##i , the traditional names of α cap ##ric ##orn ##i come from the arabic word for " the kid " , which references the constellation ' s mythology . [SEP]
[CLS] the secondary is a blue - white hue ##d star of magnitude 6 . 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] β cap ##ric ##orn ##i ' s traditional name comes from the arabic phrase for " the lucky stars of the slaughter ##er , " a reference to ritual sacrifices performed by ancient arabs at the he ##lia ##cal rising of cap ##ric ##orn ##us . [SEP]
[CLS] another star visible to the naked eye is γ cap ##ric ##orn ##i , sometimes called nash ##ira ( " bringing good ti ##ding ##s " ) ; it is a white - hue ##d giant star of magnitude 3 . 7 , 139 light - years from earth . [SEP]
[CLS] π cap ##ric ##orn ##i is a double star with a blue - white hue ##d primary of magnitude 5 . 1 and a white - hue ##d secondary of magnitude 8 . 3 . [SEP]
[CLS] it is 670 light - years from earth and the components are distinguish ##able in a small telescope . [SEP]
[CLS] at a distance of 30 , 000 light - years , it has chains of stars extending to the north that are res ##ol ##vable in small amateur telescopes . [SEP]
[CLS] one galaxy group located in cap ##ric ##orn ##us is hc ##g 87 , a group of at least three galaxies located 400 million light - years from earth ( reds ##hi ##ft 0 . 02 ##9 ##6 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the face - on spiral galaxy is experiencing abnormal ##ly high rates of star formation , indicating that it is interacting with one or both members of the group . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , the large elliptical galaxy and the edge - on spiral galaxy , both of which have active nuclei , are connected by a stream of stars and dust , indicating that they too are interacting . [SEP]
[CLS] astronomers predict that the three galaxies may merge millions of years in the future to form a giant elliptical galaxy . [SEP]
[CLS] the constellation was first attested in depictions on a cylinder - seal from around the 21st century bce , it was explicitly recorded in the babylonian star catalogue ##s before 1000 bce . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early bronze age the winter sol ##stic ##e occurred in the constellation , but due to the pre ##ces ##sion of the e ##quin ##ox ##es , the december sol ##stic ##e now takes place in the constellation sa ##git ##tar ##ius . [SEP]
[CLS] the sun is now in the constellation cap ##ric ##orn ( as distinct from the astro ##logical sign ) from late january through mid - february . [SEP]
[CLS] although the sol ##stic ##e during the northern hemisphere ' s winter no longer takes place while the sun is in the " constellation " cap ##ric ##orn ##us , as it did until 130 bce , the " astro ##logical sign " called cap ##ric ##orn is still used to denote the position of the sol ##stic ##e , and the latitude of the sun ' s most south ##erly position continues to be called the " tr ##op ##ic of cap ##ric ##orn " , a term which also applies to the line on the earth at which the sun is directly overhead at local noon on the day of the december sol ##stic ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] the planet neptune was discovered by german astronomer johann gall ##e , near den ##eb al ##ged ##i ( δ cap ##ric ##orn ##i ) on 23 september 1846 , as cap ##ric ##orn ##us can be seen best from europe at 4 : 00 in september ( although , by modern constellation boundaries established in the early 20th century ce , neptune lay within the confines of aqua ##rius at the time of its discovery ) . [SEP]
[CLS] despite its faint ##ness , the constellation cap ##ric ##orn ##us has one of the oldest mythological associations , having been consistently represented as a hybrid of a goat and a fish since the middle bronze age , when the babylonian ##s used " the goat - fish " as a symbol of their god ea . [SEP]
[CLS] in greek mythology , the constellation is sometimes identified as ama ##lth ##ea , the goat that suck ##led the infant zeus after his mother , rhea , saved him from being dev ##oured by his father , cr ##ono ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] according to some ancient greek myths , it started with the sea - goat pri ##cus . [SEP]
[CLS] pri ##cus is tied to ch ##ron ##os , the god of time in greek myths . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##ron ##os created the immortal pri ##cus , who shares ch ##ron ##os ' s ability to manipulate time . [SEP]
[CLS] he had lots of children who lived near the seas ##hore , however , when they found themselves on the dry land they turned into normal goats , losing their special ability to think and speak in the process . [SEP]
[CLS] in an effort to prevent this , pri ##cus turns back time , again and again ; however , he eventually resign ##s himself to loneliness and misery , letting the little sea goats leave him . [SEP]
[CLS] learning he cannot control their fate and not wanting to be the only sea goat prompt ##s him to ask ch ##ron ##os to let him die . [SEP]
[CLS] because he is immortal instead , he must spend eternity in the sky as cap ##ric ##orn . [SEP]
[CLS] cap ##ric ##orn ##us is also sometimes identified as pan , the god with a goat ' s head , who saved himself from the monster ty ##phon by giving himself a fish ' s tail and diving into a river . [SEP]
[CLS] ptolemy ' s method of connecting the stars of cap ##ric ##orn ##us has been influential . [SEP]
[CLS] in chinese astronomy , constellation cap ##ric ##orn ##us lies in " the black tor ##to ##ise of the north " ( 北 方 [UNK] 武 , " bei fang xu ##an wu " ) . [SEP]
