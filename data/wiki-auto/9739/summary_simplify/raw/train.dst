An emoticon ( , , rarely pronounced ), short for "emotion icon", also known simply as an emote, is a pictorial representation of a facial expression using characters—usually punctuation marks, numbers, and letters—to express a person's feelings or mood, or as a time-saving method.
The first ASCII emoticons, codice_1 and codice_2, were written by Scott Fahlman in 1982, but emoticons actually originated on the PLATO IV computer system in 1972.
In Western countries, emoticons are usually written at a right angle to the direction of the text.
As SMS and the internet became widespread in the late 1990s, emoticons became increasingly popular and were commonly used on text messages, internet forums and e-mails.
Emoticons have played a significant role in communication through technology, and some devices and applications have provided stylized pictures that do not use text punctuation.
They offer another range of "tone" and feeling through texting that portrays specific emotions through facial gestures while in the midst of text-based cyber communication.
In web forums, instant messengers and online games, text emoticons are often automatically replaced with small corresponding images, which came to be called "emoticons" as well.
Emoticons for a smiley face codice_1 and sad face codice_2 appear in the first documented use in digital form.
Certain complex character combinations can only be accomplished in non-Latin scripts, giving rise to especially complex forms, sometimes known by their romanized Japanese name of kaomoji.
The use of emoticons can be traced back to the 17th century, drawn by a Slovak notary to indicate his satisfaction with the state of his town's municipal financial records in 1635, but they were commonly used in casual and humorous writing.
Digital forms of emoticons on the Internet were included in a proposal by Scott Fahlman of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in a message on September 19, 1982.
The "National Telegraphic Review and Operators Guide" in April 1857 documented the use of the number 73 in Morse code to express "love and kisses" (later reduced to the more formal "best regards").
A "New York Times" transcript of one of Abraham Lincoln's speeches written in 1862 contains "codice_5"; there is some debate whether it is a typo, a legitimate punctuation construct, or an emoticon.
Four vertical typographical emoticons were published in 1881 by the U.S. satirical magazine "Puck", with the stated intention that the publication's letterpress department thus intended to "lay out ... all the cartoonists that ever walked".
It is to be appended, with the full stop, to every jocular or ironical sentence".
Note that the symbols are correctly oriented and are not sideways.
Emoticons had already come into use in sci-fi fandom in the 1940s, although there seems to have been a lapse in cultural continuity between the communities.
The piece, featuring typewriter-generated artwork credited to "Royal Portable", was entirely made up of repurposed typography, including a capital letter P having a bigger bust than a capital I, a lowercase b and d discussing their pregnancies, an asterisk on top of a letter to indicate the letter had just come inside from a snowfall, and a classroom of lowercase n's interrupted by a lowercase h "raising its hand".
In 1963, the "smiley face", a yellow button with two black dots representing eyes and an upturned thick curve representing a mouth was created by freelance artist Harvey Ball.
It was realized on order of a large insurance company as part of a campaign to bolster the morale of its employees and soon became a big hit.
This smiley presumably inspired many later emoticons; the most basic graphic emoticon that depicts this is, in fact, a small yellow smiley face.
Nabokov answered: "I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile – some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket, which I would now like to trace in reply to your question."
He published his icons as well as emoticons created by others, along with their ASCII versions, in an online Smiley Dictionary in the early 2000s.
The Smiley Company has trademarked its version of the smiley face in over 100 countries.
In 1997, The Smiley Company filed a trademark application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
In 2001, Walmart opposed the registration, citing a likelihood of confusion between the Loufrani smiley and a smiley face Walmart had been using since 1990.
The USPTO eventually sided with Walmart and rejected The Smiley Company's application, due to the widespread use of smiley face designs.
Seeking to prevent Walmart from using any smiley face design, Nicolas Loufrani next sued Walmart in federal court in 2009, while claiming that his smiley face was "readily distinguishable" from Walmart's.
The case was closed in 2011 when the two parties agreed to settle out of court.
The terms of the settlement were undisclosed, but Walmart continued to use its smiley design intermittently and returned to using it in a major marketing role in 2016.
For example, WOBTAX and VICTORY both produced convincing smiley faces (where the overprinted characters produced the solid background, and pixels untouched by any of the characters produced the actual design).
Scott Fahlman was the first documented person to use the emoticons codice_1 and codice_2, with a specific suggestion that they be used to express emotion.
The text of his original proposal, posted to the Carnegie Mellon University computer science general board on September 19, 1982 (11:44), was thought to have been lost, but was recovered 20 years later by Jeff Baird from old backup tapes.
Other notable computer scientists who participated in this thread include David Touretzky, Guy Steele, and Jaime Carbonell.
The most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form, but each of them can be transformed by being rotated (making them tiny ambigrams), with or without a hyphen (nose).
There are also some possible variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express a new feeling, or slightly change the mood of the emoticon.
An often used combination is also codice_17 for a heart, and codice_18 for a broken heart.
A broad grin is sometimes shown with crinkled eyes to express further amusement; codice_20 and the addition of further "D" letters can suggest laughter or extreme amusement e.g.
There are hundreds of other variations including codice_22 for anger, or codice_23 for an evil grin, which can be, again, used in reverse, for an unhappy angry face, in the shape of codice_24.
codice_25 for vampire teeth, codice_26 for grimace, and codice_27 can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone, or may be implying a second meaning in the sentence preceding it.
As computers offer increasing built-in support for non-Western writing systems, it has become possible to use other glyphs to build emoticons.
An equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon, seen as codice_29, without changing the meaning of the emoticon.
In these instances, the hyphen is almost always either omitted or, occasionally, replaced with an "o" as in codice_30 .
In most circles it has become acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes, but in some areas of usage people still prefer the larger, more traditional emoticon codice_1 or codice_32.
One linguistic study has indicated that the use of a nose in an emoticon may be related to the user's age.
Similar-looking characters are commonly substituted for one another: for instance, codice_33, codice_34, and codice_35 can all be used interchangeably, sometimes for subtly different effect or, in some cases, one type of character may look better in a certain font and therefore be preferred over another.
It is also common for the user to replace the rounded brackets used for the mouth with other, similar brackets, such as codice_36 instead of codice_37.
For example, the smiley codice_29 may occur in Scandinavia, where the keys for codice_39 and codice_37 are placed right beside each other.
The letters codice_43 and codice_44 can be seen as an emoticon, as the upright version of codice_19 (meaning that one is surprised) and codice_14 (meaning that one is very happy) respectively.
Some emoticons may be read right to left instead, and in fact can only be written using standard ASCII keyboard characters this way round; for example codice_47 which refers to being shocked or anxious, opposite to the large grin of codice_14.
"face characters") that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left.
Similar-looking emoticons were used on the Byte Information Exchange (BIX) around the same time.
The asterisks indicate the eyes; the central character, commonly an underscore, the mouth; and the parentheses, the outline of the face.
Different emotions can be expressed by changing the character representing the eyes: for example, "T" can be used to express crying or sadness: codice_50.
Looks of stress are represented by the likes of codice_53, while codice_54 is a generic emoticon for nervousness, the semicolon representing an anxiety-induced sweat drop (discussed further below).
Characters like hyphens or periods can replace the underscore; the period is often used for a smaller, "cuter" mouth, or to represent a nose, e.g.
A quotation mark codice_66, apostrophe codice_67, or semicolon codice_68 can be added to the emoticon to imply apprehension or embarrassment, in the same way that a sweat drop is used in manga and anime.
Microsoft IME 2000 (Japanese) or later supports the input of emoticons like the above by enabling the Microsoft IME Spoken Language/Emotion Dictionary.
Such dictionaries allow users to call up emoticons by typing words that represent them.
Communication software allowing the use of Shift JIS encoded Japanese characters rather than just ASCII allowed for the development of new kaomoji using the extended character set, such as codice_69 or codice_70.
English-language anime forums adopted those Japanese-style emoticons that could be used with the standard ASCII characters available on Western keyboards.
Because of this, they are often called "anime style" emoticons in English .
Emoticons such as codice_75, codice_76, codice_77, codice_78, codice_79, or codice_80 which include the parentheses, mouth or nose, and arms (especially those represented by the inequality signs < or >) also are often referred to as "Kirbys " in reference to their likeness to Nintendo's video game character Kirby.
The emoticon codice_82 uses the Eastern style, but incorporates a depiction of the Western "middle-finger flick-off" using a "t" as the arm, hand, and finger.
Using a lateral click for the nose such as in ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) is believed to originate from the Finnish image-based message board Ylilauta, and is called a "Lenny face".
Another apparently Western invention is the use of emoticons like codice_83 or codice_84 to indicate vampires or other mythical beasts with fangs.
Exposure to both Western and Japanese style emoticons or kaomoji through blogs, instant messaging, and forums featuring a blend of Western and Japanese pop culture has given rise to many emoticons that have an upright viewing format.
The parentheses are often dropped, and these emoticons typically only use alphanumeric characters and the most commonly used English punctuation marks.
The codice_103 face (and its variations codice_104 and codice_105), is an emoticon of Japanese origin which denotes a cute expression or emotion felt by the user.
Users of the Japanese discussion board 2channel, in particular, have developed a wide variety of unique emoticons using characters from various languages, such as Kannada, as in codice_111 (for a look of disapproval, disbelief, or confusion).
These were quickly picked up by 4chan and spread to other Western sites soon after.
Some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right, like Monā.
The structures of Korean and Japanese emoticons are somewhat similar, but they have some differences.
There are countless number of emoticons that can be formed with such combinations of Korean jamo letters.
However, codice_142 means smile (almost all people use this without distinction of sex or age).
The character existed in Oracle bone script, but its use as emoticon was documented as early as January 20, 2005.
In Chinese, normally full characters (as opposed to the stylistic use of 槑) may be duplicated to express emphasis.
It is also commonly used for representing a great admiration (sometimes with an overtone of sarcasm) for someone else's view or action.
It was first used in late 2002 at the forum on Techside, a Japanese personal website.
By 2005, Orz spawned a subculture: blogs have been devoted to the emoticon, and URL shortening services have been named after it.
In Taiwan, Orz is associated with the phrase "nice guy"that is, the concept of males being rejected for a date by girls they are pursuing with a phrase like "You are a nice guy."
Some services, such as MuzIcons, combine emoticons and music player in an Adobe Flash-based widget.
In 2004, the Trillian chat application introduced a feature called "emotiblips", which allows Trillian users to stream files to their instant message recipients "as the voice and video equivalent of an emoticon".
In 2007, MTV and Paramount Home Entertainment promoted the "emoticlip" as a form of viral marketing for the second season of the show "The Hills".
The emoticlips were twelve short snippets of dialogue from the show, uploaded to YouTube, which the advertisers hoped would be distributed between web users as a way of expressing feelings in a similar manner to emoticons.
The emoticlip concept is credited to the Bradley & Montgomery advertising firm, which hopes they would be widely adopted as "greeting cards that just happen to be selling something".
The Adobe Flash and Java-based application allows users to create a short animation.
Users can then email or save their own animations to use them on similar social utility applications.
During the first half of the 2010s, there have been different forms of small audiovisual pieces to be sent through instant messaging systems to express one's emotion.
These are tiny videos which can be easily transferred from one mobile phone or other device to another.
Current video compression codecs such as H.264 allow these pieces of video to be light in terms of file size and very portable.
In 2001, they issued a satirical press release, announcing that they would sue Internet users who typed the frowny; the joke backfired and the company received a storm of protest when its mock release was posted on technology news website Slashdot.
, for example, discloses a method developed in 2001 to send emoticons over a cell phone using a drop-down menu.
The emoticon codice_1 was also filed in 2006 and registered in 2008 as a European Community Trademark (CTM).
In Finland, the Supreme Administrative Court ruled in 2012 that the emoticon cannot be trademarked, thus repealing a 2006 administrative decision trademarking the emoticons codice_1, codice_29, codice_151, codice_8 and codice_9.
In 2005, a Russian court rejected a legal claim against Siemens by a man who claimed to hold a trademark on the codice_154 emoticon.
In 2008, Russian entrepreneur Oleg Teterin claimed to have been granted the trademark on the codice_154 emoticon.
Some smiley faces were present in Unicode since 1.1, including a white frowning face, a white smiling face, and a black smiling face.
For historic and compatibility reasons, some other heads and figures, which mostly represent different aspects like genders, activities and professions instead of emotions, are also found in Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs (especially U+1F466U+1F487) and Transport and Map Symbols.
