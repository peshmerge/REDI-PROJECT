[CLS] an em ##otic ##on ( , , rarely pronounced ) , short for " emotion icon " , also known simply as an em ##ote , is a pictorial representation of a facial expression using characters — usually pun ##ct ##uation marks , numbers , and letters — to express a person ' s feelings or mood , or as a time - saving method . [SEP]
[CLS] the first as ##ci ##i em ##otic ##ons , cod ##ice _ 1 and cod ##ice _ 2 , were written by scott fa ##hl ##man in 1982 , but em ##otic ##ons actually originated on the plato iv computer system in 1972 . [SEP]
[CLS] in western countries , em ##otic ##ons are usually written at a right angle to the direction of the text . [SEP]
[CLS] users from japan popularized a kind of em ##otic ##on called ka ##omo ##ji ( ; lit . [SEP]
[CLS] [UNK] ( ka ##o ) = face , 文 [UNK] ( mo ##ji ) = character ( s ) ) , utilizing the kata ##kan ##a character set , that can be understood without tilting one ' s head to the left . [SEP]
[CLS] this style arose on as ##ci ##i net of japan in 1986 . [SEP]
[CLS] as sms and the internet became widespread in the late 1990s , em ##otic ##ons became increasingly popular and were commonly used on text messages , internet forums and e - mail ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] em ##otic ##ons have played a significant role in communication through technology , and some devices and applications have provided stylized pictures that do not use text pun ##ct ##uation . [SEP]
[CLS] they offer another range of " tone " and feeling through text ##ing that portrays specific emotions through facial gestures while in the midst of text - based cyber communication . [SEP]
[CLS] the word is a port ##man ##tea ##u word of the english words " emotion " and " icon " . [SEP]
[CLS] in web forums , instant messengers and online games , text em ##otic ##ons are often automatically replaced with small corresponding images , which came to be called " em ##otic ##ons " as well . [SEP]
[CLS] em ##otic ##ons for a smiley face cod ##ice _ 1 and sad face cod ##ice _ 2 appear in the first documented use in digital form . [SEP]
[CLS] certain complex character combinations can only be accomplished in non - latin scripts , giving rise to especially complex forms , sometimes known by their romanized japanese name of ka ##omo ##ji . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of em ##otic ##ons can be traced back to the 17th century , drawn by a slovak not ##ary to indicate his satisfaction with the state of his town ' s municipal financial records in 1635 , but they were commonly used in casual and humorous writing . [SEP]
[CLS] digital forms of em ##otic ##ons on the internet were included in a proposal by scott fa ##hl ##man of carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , in a message on september 19 , 1982 . [SEP]
[CLS] the " national telegraph ##ic review and operators guide " in april 1857 documented the use of the number 73 in morse code to express " love and kisses " ( later reduced to the more formal " best regards " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] " dodge ' s manual " in 1908 documented the rein ##tro ##duction of " love and kisses " as the number 88 . [SEP]
[CLS] ga ##jad ##har and green comment that both morse code abbreviation ##s are more su ##cci ##nc ##t than modern abbreviation ##s such as lo ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] a " new york times " transcript of one of abraham lincoln ' s speeches written in 1862 contains " cod ##ice _ 5 " ; there is some debate whether it is a ty ##po , a legitimate pun ##ct ##uation construct , or an em ##otic ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] four vertical ty ##po ##graphic ##al em ##otic ##ons were published in 1881 by the u . s . satirical magazine " puck " , with the stated intention that the publication ' s letter ##press department thus intended to " lay out . . . all the cartoonist ##s that ever walked " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1912 , ambrose bi ##er ##ce proposed " an improvement in pun ##ct ##uation – the s ##nig ##ger point , or note of ca ##chin ##nation : it is written thus ‿ and presents a smiling mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] it is to be app ##ended , with the full stop , to every jo ##cular or ironic ##al sentence " . [SEP]
[CLS] in a 1936 " harvard lamp ##oon " article , alan gregg proposed ( - ) for smile , ( - - ) for laugh ( more teeth showing ) , ( # ) for frown , ( * ) for wink , and ( # ) for " intense interest , attention , and inc ##red ##uli ##ty " . [SEP]
[CLS] note that the symbols are correctly oriented and are not sideways . [SEP]
[CLS] em ##otic ##ons had already come into use in sci - fi fan ##dom in the 1940s , although there seems to have been a laps ##e in cultural continuity between the communities . [SEP]
[CLS] the september 1962 issue of " mad " magazine included an article titled " type ##wr ##i - too ##ns " . [SEP]
[CLS] the piece , featuring type ##writer - generated artwork credited to " royal portable " , was entirely made up of rep ##ur ##posed ty ##po ##graphy , including a capital letter p having a bigger bust than a capital i , a lower ##case b and d discussing their pre ##gnan ##cies , an as ##ter ##isk on top of a letter to indicate the letter had just come inside from a snowfall , and a classroom of lower ##case n ' s interrupted by a lower ##case h " raising its hand " . [SEP]
[CLS] two additional " type ##wr ##i - too ##ns " articles subsequently appeared in " mad " , in 1965 and 1987 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1963 , the " smiley face " , a yellow button with two black dots representing eyes and an up ##turn ##ed thick curve representing a mouth was created by freelance artist harvey ball . [SEP]
[CLS] it was realized on order of a large insurance company as part of a campaign to bo ##lster the morale of its employees and soon became a big hit . [SEP]
[CLS] this smiley presumably inspired many later em ##otic ##ons ; the most basic graphic em ##otic ##on that depicts this is , in fact , a small yellow smiley face . [SEP]
[CLS] in a " new york times " interview in april 1969 , al ##den whitman asked writer vladimir na ##bo ##kov : " how do you rank yourself among writers ( living ) and of the immediate past ? " [SEP]
[CLS] na ##bo ##kov answered : " i often think there should exist a special ty ##po ##graphic ##al sign for a smile – some sort of con ##cave mark , a su ##pine round bracket , which i would now like to trace in reply to your question . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1971 , a french journalist , franklin lou ##fra ##ni , created a smiley logo to mark good news in the french newspaper " france so ##ir " . [SEP]
[CLS] lou ##fra ##ni was the first person to trademark the symbol , in 1972 . [SEP]
[CLS] later , in 1996 , lou ##fra ##ni established the smiley company with his son , nicolas lou ##fra ##ni . [SEP]
[CLS] nicolas developed hundreds of different em ##otic ##ons , including 3d versions . [SEP]
[CLS] his designs were registered at the united states copyright office in 1997 and appeared online as . g [SEP]
[CLS] gi ##f files in 1998 . [SEP]
[CLS] these were the first graphical representations of the originally text - based em ##otic ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] he published his icons as well as em ##otic ##ons created by others , along with their as ##ci ##i versions , in an online smiley dictionary in the early 2000s . [SEP]
[CLS] this dictionary included over 3 , 000 different smiley ##s and was published as a book called " di ##co smiley ##s " in 2002 . [SEP]
[CLS] the smiley company has trademark ##ed its version of the smiley face in over 100 countries . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1997 , the smiley company filed a trademark application with the united states patent and trademark office . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2001 , wal ##mart opposed the registration , citing a likelihood of confusion between the lou ##fra ##ni smiley and a smiley face wal ##mart had been using since 1990 . [SEP]
[CLS] the us ##pt ##o eventually sided with wal ##mart and rejected the smiley company ' s application , due to the widespread use of smiley face designs . [SEP]
[CLS] seeking to prevent wal ##mart from using any smiley face design , nicolas lou ##fra ##ni next sued wal ##mart in federal court in 2009 , while claiming that his smiley face was " readily distinguish ##able " from wal ##mart ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] the case was closed in 2011 when the two parties agreed to settle out of court . [SEP]
[CLS] the terms of the settlement were undisclosed , but wal ##mart continued to use its smiley design intermittent ##ly and returned to using it in a major marketing role in 2016 . [SEP]
[CLS] starting circa 1972 , on the plato system , em ##otic ##ons and other decorative graphics were produced as as ##ci ##i art , particularly with over ##print ##ing : typing a character , backing up , then typing another character . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , wo ##bt ##ax and victory both produced convincing smiley faces ( where the over ##print ##ed characters produced the solid background , and pixels untouched by any of the characters produced the actual design ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this developed into a sophisticated set , particularly in combination with super ##script and sub ##script . [SEP]
[CLS] scott fa ##hl ##man was the first documented person to use the em ##otic ##ons cod ##ice _ 1 and cod ##ice _ 2 , with a specific suggestion that they be used to express emotion . [SEP]
[CLS] the text of his original proposal , posted to the carnegie mellon university computer science general board on september 19 , 1982 ( 11 : 44 ) , was thought to have been lost , but was recovered 20 years later by jeff baird from old backup tapes . [SEP]
[CLS] other notable computer scientists who participated in this thread include david tour ##etz ##ky , guy steele , and jaime carbon ##ell . [SEP]
[CLS] within a few months , it had spread to the ar ##pan ##et and use ##net . [SEP]
[CLS] many variations on the theme were immediately suggested by scott and others . [SEP]
[CLS] usually , em ##otic ##ons in western style have the eyes on the left , followed by nose and the mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] the two character version cod ##ice _ 8 which om ##its the nose is also very popular . [SEP]
[CLS] the most basic em ##otic ##ons are relatively consistent in form , but each of them can be transformed by being rotated ( making them tiny am ##bi ##gram ##s ) , with or without a h ##yp ##hen ( nose ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also some possible variations to em ##otic ##ons to get new definitions , like changing a character to express a new feeling , or slightly change the mood of the em ##otic ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , cod ##ice _ 9 equals sad and cod ##ice _ 10 equals very sad . [SEP]
[CLS] weeping can be written as cod ##ice _ 11 . [SEP]
[CLS] a blush can be expressed as cod ##ice _ 12 . [SEP]
[CLS] others include wink cod ##ice _ 13 , a grin cod ##ice _ 14 , smug cod ##ice _ 15 , and tongue out cod ##ice _ 16 , such as when blowing a ras ##p ##berry . [SEP]
[CLS] an often used combination is also cod ##ice _ 17 for a heart , and cod ##ice _ 18 for a broken heart . [SEP]
[CLS] cod ##ice _ 19 is also sometimes used to depict shock . [SEP]
[CLS] a broad grin is sometimes shown with cr ##ink ##led eyes to express further amusement ; cod ##ice _ 20 and the addition of further " d " letters can suggest laughter or extreme amusement e . g . cod ##ice _ 21 . [SEP]
[CLS] there are hundreds of other variations including cod ##ice _ 22 for anger , or cod ##ice _ 23 for an evil grin , which can be , again , used in reverse , for an unhappy angry face , in the shape of cod ##ice _ 24 . [SEP]
[CLS] cod ##ice _ 25 for vampire teeth , cod ##ice _ 26 for grimace , and cod ##ice _ 27 can be used to denote a flirting or joking tone , or may be implying a second meaning in the sentence preceding it . [SEP]
[CLS] as computers offer increasing built - in support for non - western writing systems , it has become possible to use other g ##ly ##phs to build em ##otic ##ons . [SEP]
[CLS] the ' shrug ' em ##otic ##on , cod ##ice _ 28 , uses the g ##ly ##ph ツ from the japanese kata ##kan ##a writing system . [SEP]
[CLS] an equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon , seen as cod ##ice _ 29 , without changing the meaning of the em ##otic ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] in these instances , the h ##yp ##hen is almost always either omitted or , occasionally , replaced with an " o " as in cod ##ice _ 30 . [SEP]
[CLS] in most circles it has become acceptable to om ##it the h ##yp ##hen , whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes , but in some areas of usage people still prefer the larger , more traditional em ##otic ##on cod ##ice _ 1 or cod ##ice _ 32 . [SEP]
[CLS] one linguistic study has indicated that the use of a nose in an em ##otic ##on may be related to the user ' s age . [SEP]
[CLS] similar - looking characters are commonly substituted for one another : for instance , cod ##ice _ 33 , cod ##ice _ 34 , and cod ##ice _ 35 can all be used interchange ##ably , sometimes for subtly different effect or , in some cases , one type of character may look better in a certain font and therefore be preferred over another . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also common for the user to replace the rounded brackets used for the mouth with other , similar brackets , such as cod ##ice _ 36 instead of cod ##ice _ 37 . [SEP]
[CLS] some variants are also more common in certain countries due to keyboard layout ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the smiley cod ##ice _ 29 may occur in scandinavia , where the keys for cod ##ice _ 39 and cod ##ice _ 37 are placed right beside each other . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the cod ##ice _ 8 variant is without a doubt the dominant one in scandinavia , making the cod ##ice _ 29 version a ra ##rity . [SEP]
[CLS] dia ##cr ##itical marks are sometimes used . [SEP]
[CLS] the letters cod ##ice _ 43 and cod ##ice _ 44 can be seen as an em ##otic ##on , as the upright version of cod ##ice _ 19 ( meaning that one is surprised ) and cod ##ice _ 14 ( meaning that one is very happy ) respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] some em ##otic ##ons may be read right to left instead , and in fact can only be written using standard as ##ci ##i keyboard characters this way round ; for example cod ##ice _ 47 which refers to being shocked or anxious , opposite to the large grin of cod ##ice _ 14 . [SEP]
[CLS] users from japan popularized a style of em ##otic ##ons ( , " ka ##omo ##ji , lit . " [SEP]
[CLS] " face characters " ) that can be understood without tilting one ' s head to the left . [SEP]
[CLS] this style arose on as ##ci ##i net , an early japanese online service , in 1986 . [SEP]
[CLS] similar - looking em ##otic ##ons were used on the byte information exchange ( bi ##x ) around the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] these em ##otic ##ons are usually found in a format similar to cod ##ice _ 49 . [SEP]
[CLS] the as ##ter ##isk ##s indicate the eyes ; the central character , commonly an under ##sco ##re , the mouth ; and the parentheses , the outline of the face . [SEP]
[CLS] different emotions can be expressed by changing the character representing the eyes : for example , " t " can be used to express crying or sadness : cod ##ice _ 50 . [SEP]
[CLS] cod ##ice _ 51 may also be used to mean " un ##im ##pressed " . [SEP]
[CLS] the emphasis on the eyes in this style is reflected in the common usage of em ##otic ##ons that use only the eyes , e . g . cod ##ice _ 52 . [SEP]
[CLS] looks of stress are represented by the likes of cod ##ice _ 53 , while cod ##ice _ 54 is a generic em ##otic ##on for nervous ##ness , the semi ##col ##on representing an anxiety - induced sweat drop ( discussed further below ) . [SEP]
[CLS] cod ##ice _ 55 can indicate embarrassment by symbol ##izing blushing . [SEP]
[CLS] characters like h ##yp ##hen ##s or periods can replace the under ##sco ##re ; the period is often used for a smaller , " cute ##r " mouth , or to represent a nose , e . g . cod ##ice _ 56 . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatively , the mouth / nose can be left out entirely , e . g . cod ##ice _ 57 . [SEP]
[CLS] parentheses are sometimes replaced with brace ##s or square brackets , e . g . cod ##ice _ 58 or cod ##ice _ 59 . [SEP]
[CLS] many times , the parentheses are left out completely , e . g . cod ##ice _ 52 , cod ##ice _ 61 , cod ##ice _ 62 , cod ##ice _ 63 , cod ##ice _ 64 , or cod ##ice _ 65 . [SEP]
[CLS] a quota ##tion mark cod ##ice _ 66 , ap ##ost ##rop ##he cod ##ice _ 67 , or semi ##col ##on cod ##ice _ 68 can be added to the em ##otic ##on to imply apprehension or embarrassment , in the same way that a sweat drop is used in manga and anime . [SEP]
[CLS] microsoft im ##e 2000 ( japanese ) or later supports the input of em ##otic ##ons like the above by enabling the microsoft im ##e spoken language / emotion dictionary . [SEP]
[CLS] in im ##e 2007 , this support was moved to the em ##otic ##ons dictionary . [SEP]
[CLS] such di ##ction ##aries allow users to call up em ##otic ##ons by typing words that represent them . [SEP]
[CLS] communication software allowing the use of shift ji ##s encoded japanese characters rather than just as ##ci ##i allowed for the development of new ka ##omo ##ji using the extended character set , such as cod ##ice _ 69 or cod ##ice _ 70 . [SEP]
[CLS] modern communication software generally utilizes unicode , which allows for the incorporation of characters from other languages ( e . g . from the cyrillic alphabet ) , and a variety of symbols into the ka ##omo ##ji , as in cod ##ice _ 71 or cod ##ice _ 72 . [SEP]
[CLS] further variations can be produced using unicode combining characters , as in cod ##ice _ 73 or cod ##ice _ 74 . [SEP]
[CLS] english - language anime forums adopted those japanese - style em ##otic ##ons that could be used with the standard as ##ci ##i characters available on western keyboards . [SEP]
[CLS] because of this , they are often called " anime style " em ##otic ##ons in english . [SEP]
[CLS] they have since seen use in more mainstream venues , including online gaming , instant - messaging , and non - anime - related discussion forums . [SEP]
[CLS] em ##otic ##ons such as cod ##ice _ 75 , cod ##ice _ 76 , cod ##ice _ 77 , cod ##ice _ 78 , cod ##ice _ 79 , or cod ##ice _ 80 which include the parentheses , mouth or nose , and arms ( especially those represented by the inequality signs < or > ) also are often referred to as " kirby ##s " in reference to their likeness to nintendo ' s video game character kirby . [SEP]
[CLS] the parentheses are sometimes dropped when used in the english language context , and the under ##sco ##re of the mouth may be extended as an int ##ens ##ifier for the em ##otic ##on in question , e . g . cod ##ice _ 81 for very happy . [SEP]
[CLS] the em ##otic ##on cod ##ice _ 82 uses the eastern style , but incorporates a depiction of the western " middle - finger flick - off " using a " t " as the arm , hand , and finger . [SEP]
[CLS] using a lateral click for the nose such as in ( ° [UNK] ° ) is believed to originate from the finnish image - based message board y ##li ##lau ##ta , and is called a " lenny face " . [SEP]
[CLS] another apparently western invention is the use of em ##otic ##ons like cod ##ice _ 83 or cod ##ice _ 84 to indicate vampires or other mythical beasts with fangs . [SEP]
[CLS] exposure to both western and japanese style em ##otic ##ons or ka ##omo ##ji through blogs , instant messaging , and forums featuring a blend of western and japanese pop culture has given rise to many em ##otic ##ons that have an upright viewing format . [SEP]
[CLS] the parentheses are often dropped , and these em ##otic ##ons typically only use alpha ##num ##eric characters and the most commonly used english pun ##ct ##uation marks . [SEP]
[CLS] em ##otic ##ons such as cod ##ice _ 85 , cod ##ice _ 86 , cod ##ice _ 87 , cod ##ice _ 88 , cod ##ice _ 89 , cod ##ice _ 51 , cod ##ice _ 91 , and cod ##ice _ 92 are used to convey mixed emotions that are more difficult to convey with traditional em ##otic ##ons . [SEP]
[CLS] characters are sometimes added to em ##otic ##ons to convey an anime - or manga - styled sweat drop , for example cod ##ice _ 93 , cod ##ice _ 94 , cod ##ice _ 95 , cod ##ice _ 96 , and cod ##ice _ 97 . [SEP]
[CLS] the equals sign can also be used for closed , anime - looking eyes , for example cod ##ice _ 98 , cod ##ice _ 99 , cod ##ice _ 100 , cod ##ice _ 101 , and cod ##ice _ 102 . [SEP]
[CLS] the cod ##ice _ 103 face ( and its variations cod ##ice _ 104 and cod ##ice _ 105 ) , is an em ##otic ##on of japanese origin which denotes a cute expression or emotion felt by the user . [SEP]
[CLS] in brazil , sometimes combining characters ( accents ) are added to em ##otic ##ons to represent eyebrows , as in cod ##ice _ 106 , cod ##ice _ 107 , cod ##ice _ 108 , cod ##ice _ 109 , or cod ##ice _ 110 . [SEP]
[CLS] users of the japanese discussion board 2 ##channel , in particular , have developed a wide variety of unique em ##otic ##ons using characters from various languages , such as kannada , as in cod ##ice _ 111 ( for a look of disapproval , disbelief , or confusion ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these were quickly picked up by 4 ##chan and spread to other western sites soon after . [SEP]
[CLS] some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right , like mona . [SEP]
[CLS] in south korea , em ##otic ##ons use korean hangul letters , and the western style is rarely used . [SEP]
[CLS] the structures of korean and japanese em ##otic ##ons are somewhat similar , but they have some differences . [SEP]
[CLS] korean style contains korean jam ##o ( letters ) instead of other characters . [SEP]
[CLS] there are countless number of em ##otic ##ons that can be formed with such combinations of korean jam ##o letters . [SEP]
[CLS] consonant jam ##os cod ##ice _ 112 , cod ##ice _ 113 or cod ##ice _ 114 as the mouth / nose component and cod ##ice _ 115 , cod ##ice _ 116 or cod ##ice _ 117 for the eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] for example : cod ##ice _ 118 , cod ##ice _ 119 , cod ##ice _ 120 and cod ##ice _ 121 . [SEP]
[CLS] faces such as cod ##ice _ 122 , cod ##ice _ 123 , cod ##ice _ 124 and cod ##ice _ 125 , using quota ##tion marks cod ##ice _ 66 and ap ##ost ##rop ##hes cod ##ice _ 67 are also commonly used combinations . [SEP]
[CLS] vowel jam ##os such as ᅮ , ᅲ depict a crying face . [SEP]
[CLS] example : cod ##ice _ 128 , cod ##ice _ 129 and cod ##ice _ 130 ( same function as t in western style ) . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes ᅳ ( not an em - dash " — " but a vowel jam ##o ) , a com ##ma or an under ##sco ##re is added , and the two character sets can be mixed together , as in cod ##ice _ 131 , cod ##ice _ 132 , cod ##ice _ 133 , cod ##ice _ 134 , cod ##ice _ 135 and cod ##ice _ 136 . [SEP]
[CLS] also , semi ##col ##ons and care ##ts are commonly used in korean em ##otic ##ons ; semi ##col ##ons mean sweating ( embarrassed ) . [SEP]
[CLS] if they are used with ᅳ or – they depict a bad feeling . [SEP]
[CLS] examples : cod ##ice _ 137 , cod ##ice _ 138 , cod ##ice _ 139 , cod ##ice _ 140 and cod ##ice _ 141 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , cod ##ice _ 142 means smile ( almost all people use this without distinction of sex or age ) . [SEP]
[CLS] others include : cod ##ice _ 143 , cod ##ice _ 144 , cod ##ice _ 145 , cod ##ice _ 146 . [SEP]
[CLS] the character [UNK] ( u + 56 ##e ##7 ) , which means " bright " , it is also combined with posture em ##otic ##on or ##z , such as [UNK] r ##z . [SEP]
[CLS] the character existed in oracle bone script , but its use as em ##otic ##on was documented as early as january 20 , 2005 . [SEP]
[CLS] other id ##eo ##graphic variants for [UNK] include [UNK] ( king [UNK] ) , [UNK] ( queen [UNK] ) , [UNK] ( [UNK] with hat ) , [UNK] [UNK] ( turtle ) , [UNK] ( bomber ##man ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the character [UNK] ( u + 69 ##d ##1 ) , which sounds like the word for " plum " ( [UNK] ( u + fa ##44 ) ) , is used to represent double of [UNK] ( dull ) , or further magnitude of dull ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] in chinese , normally full characters ( as opposed to the stylistic use of [UNK] ) may be duplicate ##d to express emphasis . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##z ( other forms include : or ##2 , on _ , ot ##z , ot ##l , st ##o , j ##to , _ no , _ [UNK] [UNK] , [UNK] r ##z , ) is an em ##otic ##on representing a kneeling or bowing person ( the japanese version of which is called " dog ##eza " ) with the " o " being the head , the " r " being the arms and part of the body , and the " z " being part of the body and the legs . [SEP]
[CLS] this stick figure can represent failure and despair . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also commonly used for representing a great admiration ( sometimes with an over ##tone of sarcasm ) for someone else ' s view or action . [SEP]
[CLS] it was first used in late 2002 at the forum on tech ##side , a japanese personal website . [SEP]
[CLS] at the " tech ##side fa ##q forum " ( tech ##side [UNK] え ##て [UNK] bb ##s ( [UNK] え ##て ##bbs ) ) , a poster asked about a cable cover , typing " _ | | [UNK] " to show a cable and its cover . [SEP]
[CLS] others commented that it looked like a kneeling person , and the symbol became popular . [SEP]
[CLS] these comments were soon deleted as they were considered off - topic . [SEP]
[CLS] by 2005 , or ##z spawned a sub ##culture : blogs have been devoted to the em ##otic ##on , and ur ##l short ##ening services have been named after it . [SEP]
[CLS] in taiwan , or ##z is associated with the phrase " nice guy " that is , the concept of males being rejected for a date by girls they are pursuing with a phrase like " you are a nice guy . " [SEP]
[CLS] or ##z should not be confused with m ( _ _ ) m , which means " thank you " or an apology . [SEP]
[CLS] a port ##man ##tea ##u of " emotion " and " sound " , an em ##ot ##iso ##und is a brief sound transmitted and played back during the viewing of a message , typically an im message or e - mail message . [SEP]
[CLS] the sound is intended to communicate an emotional sub ##text . [SEP]
[CLS] many instant messaging clients automatically trigger sound effects in response to specific em ##otic ##ons . [SEP]
[CLS] some services , such as mu ##zic ##ons , combine em ##otic ##ons and music player in an adobe flash - based wi ##dget . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2004 , the tri ##lli ##an chat application introduced a feature called " em ##ot ##ib ##lip ##s " , which allows tri ##lli ##an users to stream files to their instant message recipients " as the voice and video equivalent of an em ##otic ##on " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2007 , mtv and paramount home entertainment promoted the " em ##otic ##lip " as a form of viral marketing for the second season of the show " the hills " . [SEP]
[CLS] the em ##otic ##lip ##s were twelve short s ##ni ##ppet ##s of dialogue from the show , uploaded to youtube , which the ad ##vert ##iser ##s hoped would be distributed between web users as a way of expressing feelings in a similar manner to em ##otic ##ons . [SEP]
[CLS] the em ##otic ##lip concept is credited to the bradley & montgomery advertising firm , which hopes they would be widely adopted as " greeting cards that just happen to be selling something " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2008 , an emotion - sequence animation tool , called fun ##icon ##s was created . [SEP]
[CLS] the adobe flash and java - based application allows users to create a short animation . [SEP]
[CLS] users can then email or save their own animation ##s to use them on similar social utility applications . [SEP]
[CLS] during the first half of the 2010s , there have been different forms of small audio ##vis ##ual pieces to be sent through instant messaging systems to express one ' s emotion . [SEP]
[CLS] these videos lack an established name , and there are several ways to designate them : " em ##otic ##lip ##s " ( named above ) , " em ##ot ##iv ##ide ##os " or more recently " em ##otic ##on videos " . [SEP]
[CLS] these are tiny videos which can be easily transferred from one mobile phone or other device to another . [SEP]
[CLS] current video compression code ##cs such as h . 264 allow these pieces of video to be light in terms of file size and very portable . [SEP]
[CLS] the popular computer and mobile app sky ##pe uses these in a separate keyboard or by typing the code of the " em ##otic ##on videos " between parentheses . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2000 , despair , inc . obtained a u . s . trademark registration for the " frown ##y " em ##otic ##on cod ##ice _ 2 when used on " greeting cards , posters and art prints " . [SEP]
