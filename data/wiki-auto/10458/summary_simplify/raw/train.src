Emperor Hanzei (反正天皇 , Hanzei-tennō ) was the 18th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
No firm dates can be assigned to this Emperor's life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 406 CE to 410 CE.
Hanzei is regarded by historians as a "legendary Emperor" of the 5th century.
The reign of Emperor Kinmei ( 509 – 571 AD), the 29th Emperor, is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates; however, the conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kanmu (737–806), the 50th sovereign of the Yamato dynasty.
Hanzei's contemporary title would not have been "tennō", as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō.
Alternatively, Hanzei might have been referred to as ヤマト大王/大君 or the "Great King of Yamato".
The description of Hanzei in the "Kojiki" is daunting as he is described as standing over nine feet tall and have enormous teeth all the same size.
He is said to have ruled from the palace of Shibagaki at Tajihi in Kawachi (present-day Matsubara, Osaka); and he is said to have died peacefully in his palace.
The actual site of Hanzei's grave is not known.
The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") in Sakai, Osaka.
