Emperor Hanzei (反正天皇, "Hanzei-tennō") was the 18th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Hanzei to be possibly legendary, but probable.
The name Hanzei"-tennō" was created for him posthumously by later generations.
No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign.
The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.
According to "Nihonshoki" and "Kojiki", he was a son of Emperor Nintoku.
The eldest son would become known as Emperor Richū.
Hanzei was the brother of Richū.
Hanzei's enthronement by-passed Richū's two sons.
Few other details have survived.
Very little is known about the events of Hanzei's life and reign.
Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.
Hanzei's reign is described as a time of peace.
He died quietly in his palace.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Hanzei.
According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun") at Sakai.
Hanzei is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.
