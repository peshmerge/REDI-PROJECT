[CLS] his wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel " a farewell to arms " ( 1929 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1921 , he married hadley richardson , the first of four wives . [SEP]
[CLS] they moved to paris where he worked as a foreign correspondent and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the 1920s " lost generation " ex ##pa ##tri ##ate community . [SEP]
[CLS] his debut novel " the sun also rises " was published in 1926 . [SEP]

[CLS] in 1959 , he bought a house in ke ##tch ##um , idaho where he ended his own life in mid - 1961 . [SEP]
[CLS] ernest miller hemingway was born on july 21 , 1899 , in oak park , illinois , a suburb of chicago . [SEP]
[CLS] his father , clarence edmond ##s hemingway , was a physician , and his mother , grace hall hemingway , was a musician . [SEP]
[CLS] both were well - educated and well - respected in oak park , a conservative community about which resident frank lloyd wright said , " so many churches for so many good people to go to . " [SEP]
[CLS] for a short period after their marriage , clarence and grace hemingway lived with grace ' s father , ernest hall , their first son ' s namesake . [SEP]
[CLS] later , ernest hemingway would say that he disliked his name , which he " associated with the naive , even foolish hero of oscar wilde ' s play " the importance of being earnest " " . [SEP]
[CLS] the family eventually moved into a seven - bedroom home in a respectable neighborhood with a music studio for grace and a medical office for clarence . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway ' s mother frequently performed in concerts around the village . [SEP]
[CLS] as an adult , hemingway prof ##essed to hate his mother , although biographer michael s . reynolds points out that hemingway mirrored her energy and enthusiasm . [SEP]
[CLS] her insistence that he learn to play the cello became a " source of conflict " , but he later admitted the music lessons were useful to his writing , as is evident in the " contra ##pu ##ntal structure " of " for whom the bell toll ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] the family spent summers at wind ##eme ##re on wall ##oon lake , near pet ##os ##key , michigan . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway ' s father taught him to hunt , fish , and camp in the woods and lakes of northern michigan as a young boy . [SEP]
[CLS] these early experiences in nature ins ##till ##ed a passion for outdoor adventure and living in remote or isolated areas . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1913 until 1917 , hemingway attended oak park and river forest high school . [SEP]
[CLS] he took part in a number of sports such as boxing , track and field , water polo , and football . [SEP]
[CLS] he excelled in english classes , and with his sister marcel ##line , performed in the school orchestra for two years . [SEP]
[CLS] during his junior year he had a journalism class , structured " as though the classroom were a newspaper office , " with better writers submit ##ting pieces to the school newspaper , " the trap ##ez ##e " . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway and marcel ##line both submitted pieces ; hemingway ' s first piece , published in january 1916 , was about a local performance by the chicago symphony orchestra . [SEP]
[CLS] he edited the " trap ##ez ##e " and the " tab ##ula " ( the yearbook ) , im ##itating the language of sports ##writer ##s , taking the pen name ring la ##rd ##ner , jr . — a nod to ring la ##rd ##ner of the " chicago tribune " whose by ##line was " line o ' type . " [SEP]
[CLS] like mark twain , stephen crane , theodore dr ##eis ##er , and sinclair lewis , hemingway was a journalist before becoming a novelist . [SEP]
[CLS] after leaving high school he went to work for " the kansas city star " as a cub reporter . [SEP]
[CLS] although he stayed there for only six months , he relied on the " star " ' s style guide as a foundation for his writing : " use short sentences . [SEP]
[CLS] use short first paragraph ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] be positive , not negative . " [SEP]
[CLS] early in 1918 , after applying to serve with , and being turned down by , the us army , navy and marines because of poor eyes ##ight , hemingway responded to a red cross recruitment effort in kansas city and signed on to become an ambulance driver in italy . [SEP]
[CLS] he left new york in may and arrived in paris as the city was under bombardment from german artillery . [SEP]
[CLS] by june , he was at the italian front . [SEP]
[CLS] it was probably around this time that he first met john dos pass ##os , with whom he had a rocky relationship for decades . [SEP]
[CLS] on his first day in milan , he was sent to the scene of a munitions factory explosion , where rescue ##rs retrieved the shredded remains of female workers . [SEP]
[CLS] he described the incident in his non - fiction book " death in the afternoon " : " i remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments . " [SEP]
[CLS] a few days later , he was stationed at f ##ossa ##lta di pia ##ve . [SEP]
[CLS] on july 8 , he was seriously wounded by mortar fire , having just returned from the canteen bringing chocolate and cigarettes for the men at the front line . [SEP]
[CLS] despite his wounds , hemingway assisted italian soldiers to safety , for which he received the italian silver medal of bravery . [SEP]
[CLS] he was still only 18 at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway later said of the incident : " when you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality . [SEP]
[CLS] other people get killed ; not you . . . then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you . " [SEP]
[CLS] he sustained severe sh ##ra ##p ##nel wounds to both legs , underwent an immediate operation at a distribution center , and spent five days at a field hospital before he was transferred for rec ##up ##eration to the red cross hospital in milan . [SEP]
[CLS] he spent six months at the hospital , where he met and formed a strong friendship with " chin ##k " dorm ##an - smith that lasted for decades and shared a room with future american foreign service officer , ambassador , and author henry serra ##no villa ##rd . [SEP]
[CLS] while rec ##up ##era ##ting , he fell in love for the first time with agnes von ku ##row ##sky , a red cross nurse seven years his senior . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time of his release and return to the united states in january 1919 , agnes and hemingway had decided to marry within a few months in america . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in march , she wrote that she had become engaged to an italian officer . [SEP]
[CLS] biographer jeffrey meyer ##s states in his book " hemingway : a biography " that hemingway was devastated by agnes ' s rejection , and in future relationships , he followed a pattern of abandoning a wife before she abandoned him . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway returned home early in 1919 to a time of read ##just ##ment . [SEP]
[CLS] before the age of 20 , he had gained from the war a maturity that was at odds with living at home without a job and with the need for rec ##up ##eration . [SEP]
[CLS] as reynolds explains , " hemingway could not really tell his parents what he thought when he saw his bloody knee . " [SEP]
[CLS] he was not able to tell them how scared he had been " in another country with surgeons who could not tell him in english if his leg was coming off or not . " [SEP]
[CLS] in september , he took a fishing and camping trip with high school friends to the back - country of michigan ' s upper peninsula . [SEP]
[CLS] the trip became the inspiration for his short story " big two - hearted river " , in which the semi - autobiographical character nick adams takes to the country to find solitude after returning from war . [SEP]
[CLS] a family friend offered him a job in toronto , and with nothing else to do , he accepted . [SEP]
[CLS] late that year he began as a freelance ##r and staff writer for the " toronto star weekly " . [SEP]
[CLS] he returned to michigan the following june and then moved to chicago in september 1920 to live with friends , while still filing stories for the " toronto star " . [SEP]
[CLS] in chicago , he worked as an associate editor of the monthly journal " cooperative commonwealth " , where he met novelist sherwood anderson . [SEP]
[CLS] when st . louis native hadley richardson came to chicago to visit the sister of hemingway ' s roommate , hemingway became in ##fat ##uated . [SEP]
[CLS] he later claimed , " i knew she was the girl i was going to marry . " [SEP]
[CLS] hadley , red - haired , with a " nur ##turing instinct , " was eight years older than hemingway . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the age difference , hadley , who had grown up with an over ##pro ##tec ##tive mother , seemed less mature than usual for a young woman her age . [SEP]
[CLS] bern ##ice ke ##rt , author of " the hemingway women " , claims hadley was " ev ##oca ##tive " of agnes , but that hadley had a childish ##ness that agnes lacked . [SEP]
[CLS] the two corresponded for a few months and then decided to marry and travel to europe . [SEP]
[CLS] they wanted to visit rome , but sherwood anderson convinced them to visit paris instead , writing letters of introduction for the young couple . [SEP]
[CLS] they were married on september 3 , 1921 ; two months later , hemingway was hired as foreign correspondent for the " toronto star " , and the couple left for paris . [SEP]
[CLS] of hemingway ' s marriage to hadley , meyer ##s claims : " with hadley , hemingway achieved everything he had hoped for with agnes : the love of a beautiful woman , a comfortable income , a life in europe . " [SEP]
[CLS] carlos baker , hemingway ' s first biographer , believes that while anderson suggested paris because " the monetary exchange rate " made it an inexpensive place to live , more importantly it was where " the most interesting people in the world " lived . [SEP]
[CLS] in paris , hemingway met american writer and art collector gertrude stein , irish novelist james joyce , american poet ezra pound ( who " could help a young writer up the run ##gs of a career " ) and other writers . [SEP]
[CLS] the hemingway of the early paris years was a " tall , handsome , muscular , broad - shouldered , brown - eyed , rosy - cheek ##ed , square - jaw ##ed , soft - voiced young man . " [SEP]
[CLS] he and hadley lived in a small walk - up at 74 rue du cardinal le ##mo ##ine in the latin quarter , and he worked in a rented room in a nearby building . [SEP]
[CLS] stein , who was the bastion of modernism in paris , became hemingway ' s mentor and god ##mot ##her to his son jack ; she introduced him to the ex ##pa ##tri ##ate artists and writers of the mont ##par ##nas ##se quarter , whom she referred to as the " lost generation " — a term hemingway popularized with the publication of " the sun also rises " . [SEP]
[CLS] a regular at stein ' s salon , hemingway met influential painters such as pablo picasso , joan mir ##o , and juan gr ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] he eventually withdrew from stein ' s influence and their relationship deteriorated into a literary quarrel that spanned decades . [SEP]
[CLS] ezra pound met hemingway by chance at sylvia beach ' s books ##hop shakespeare and company in 1922 . [SEP]
[CLS] the two toured italy in 1923 and lived on the same street in 1924 . [SEP]
[CLS] they forged a strong friendship , and in hemingway , pound recognized and foster ##ed a young talent . [SEP]
[CLS] pound introduced hemingway to james joyce , with whom hemingway frequently embarked on " alcoholic sp ##ree ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] during his first 20 months in paris , hemingway filed 88 stories for the " toronto star " newspaper . [SEP]
[CLS] he covered the greco - turkish war , where he witnessed the burning of sm ##yr ##na , and wrote travel pieces such as " tuna fishing in spain " and " trout fishing all across europe : spain has the best , then germany " . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway was devastated on learning that hadley had lost a suitcase filled with his manuscripts at the ga ##re de lyon as she was traveling to geneva to meet him in december 1922 . [SEP]
[CLS] the following september , the couple returned to toronto , where their son john hadley nic ##anor was born on october 10 , 1923 . [SEP]
[CLS] during their absence , hemingway ' s first book , " three stories and ten poems " , was published . [SEP]
[CLS] two of the stories it contained were all that remained after the loss of the suitcase , and the third had been written early the previous year in italy . [SEP]
[CLS] within months a second volume , " in our time " ( without capitals ) , was published . [SEP]
[CLS] the small volume included six vi ##gne ##ttes and a dozen stories hemingway had written the previous summer during his first visit to spain , where he discovered the thrill of the " co ##rri ##da " . [SEP]
[CLS] he missed paris , considered toronto boring , and wanted to return to the life of a writer , rather than live the life of a journalist . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway , hadley and their son ( nicknamed bum ##by ) returned to paris in january 1924 and moved into a new apartment on the rue notre - dame des champs . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway helped ford mad ##ox ford edit " the transatlantic review " , which published works by pound , john dos pass ##os , baroness elsa von frey ##tag - lori ##ng ##ho ##ven , and stein , as well as some of hemingway ' s own early stories such as " indian camp " . [SEP]
[CLS] when " in our time " was published in 1925 , the dust jacket bore comments from ford . [SEP]
[CLS] " indian camp " received considerable praise ; ford saw it as an important early story by a young writer , and critics in the united states praised hemingway for rein ##vi ##gor ##ating the short story genre with his crisp style and use of dec ##lar ##ative sentences . [SEP]
[CLS] six months earlier , hemingway had met f . scott fitzgerald , and the pair formed a friendship of " admiration and hostility " . [SEP]
[CLS] fitzgerald had published " the great ga ##ts ##by " the same year : hemingway read it , liked it , and decided his next work had to be a novel . [SEP]
[CLS] with his wife hadley , hemingway first visited the festival of san fe ##rmin in pam ##pl ##ona , spain , in 1923 , where he became fascinated by bull ##fighting . [SEP]
[CLS] it is at this time that he began to be referred to as " papa " , even by much older friends . [SEP]
[CLS] hadley would much later recall that hemingway had his own nickname ##s for everyone , and that he often did things for his friends ; she suggested that he liked to be looked up to . [SEP]
[CLS] she didn ' t remember precisely how the nickname came into being ; however , it certainly stuck . [SEP]
[CLS] the hemingway ##s returned to pam ##pl ##ona in 1924 and a third time in june 1925 ; that year they brought with them a group of american and british ex ##pa ##tri ##ates : hemingway ' s michigan boy ##hood friend bill smith , donald ogden stewart , lady duff t ##wy ##sden ( recently divorced ) , her lover pat guthrie , and harold lo ##eb . [SEP]
[CLS] a few days after the fiesta ended , on his birthday ( july 21 ) , he began to write the draft of what would become " the sun also rises " , finishing eight weeks later . [SEP]
[CLS] a few months later , in december 1925 , the hemingway ##s left to spend the winter in sc ##hr ##un ##s , austria , where hemingway began rev ##ising the manuscript extensively . [SEP]
[CLS] pauline p ##fe ##iff ##er joined them in january and against hadley ' s advice , urged hemingway to sign a contract with sc ##ri ##bner ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] he left austria for a quick trip to new york to meet with the publishers , and on his return , during a stop in paris , began an affair with p ##fe ##iff ##er , before returning to sc ##hr ##un ##s to finish the revisions in march . [SEP]
[CLS] the manuscript arrived in new york in april ; he corrected the final proof in paris in august 1926 , and sc ##ri ##bner ' s published the novel in october . [SEP]
[CLS] " the sun also rises " ep ##ito ##mi ##zed the post - war ex ##pa ##tri ##ate generation , received good reviews , and is " recognized as hemingway ' s greatest work " . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway himself later wrote to his editor max perkins that the " point of the book " was not so much about a generation being lost , but that " the earth ab ##ide ##th forever " ; he believed the characters in " the sun also rises " may have been " battered " but were not lost . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway ' s marriage to hadley deteriorated as he was working on " the sun also rises " . [SEP]
[CLS] in early 1926 , hadley became aware of his affair with p ##fe ##iff ##er , who came to pam ##pl ##ona with them that july . [SEP]
[CLS] on their return to paris , hadley asked for a separation ; in november she formally requested a divorce . [SEP]
[CLS] they split their possessions while hadley accepted hemingway ' s offer of the proceeds from " the sun also rises " . [SEP]
[CLS] the couple were divorced in january 1927 , and hemingway married p ##fe ##iff ##er in may . [SEP]
[CLS] p ##fe ##iff ##er , who was from a wealthy catholic arkansas family , had moved to paris to work for " vogue " magazine . [SEP]
[CLS] before their marriage , hemingway converted to catholicism . [SEP]
[CLS] they honeymoon ##ed in le gr ##au - du - roi , where he contracted ant ##hra ##x , and he planned his next collection of short stories , " men without women " , which was published in october 1927 , and included his boxing story " fifty grand " . [SEP]
[CLS] " cosmopolitan " magazine editor - in - chief ray long praised " fifty grand " , calling it , " one of the best short stories that ever came to my hands . . . the best prize - fight story i ever read . . . a remarkable piece of realism . " [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of the year pauline , who was pregnant , wanted to move back to america . [SEP]
[CLS] john dos pass ##os recommended key west , and they left paris in march 1928 . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway suffered a severe injury in their paris bathroom when he pulled a sky ##light down on his head thinking he was pulling on a toilet chain . [SEP]
[CLS] this left him with a prominent forehead scar , which he carried for the rest of his life . [SEP]
[CLS] when hemingway was asked about the scar , he was reluctant to answer . [SEP]
[CLS] after his departure from paris , hemingway " never again lived in a big city " . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway and pauline traveled to kansas city , where their son patrick was born on june 28 , 1928 . [SEP]
[CLS] pauline had a difficult delivery ; hemingway fictional ##ized a version of the event as a part of " a farewell to arms " . [SEP]
[CLS] after patrick ' s birth , pauline and hemingway traveled to wyoming , massachusetts , and new york . [SEP]
[CLS] in the winter , he was in new york with bum ##by , about to board a train to florida , when he received a cable telling him that his father had killed himself . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway was devastated , having earlier written to his father telling him not to worry about financial difficulties ; the letter arrived minutes after the suicide . [SEP]
[CLS] he realized how hadley must have felt after her own father ' s suicide in 1903 , and he commented , " i ' ll probably go the same way . " [SEP]
[CLS] upon his return to key west in december , hemingway worked on the draft of " a farewell to arms " before leaving for france in january . [SEP]
[CLS] he had finished it in august but delayed the revision . [SEP]
[CLS] the serial ##ization in " sc ##ri ##bner ' s magazine " was scheduled to begin in may , but as late as april , hemingway was still working on the ending , which he may have re ##written as many as seventeen times . [SEP]
[CLS] the completed novel was published on september 27 . [SEP]
[CLS] biographer james mel ##low believes " a farewell to arms " established hemingway ' s stature as a major american writer and displayed a level of complexity not apparent in " the sun also rises " . [SEP]
[CLS] in spain in mid - 1929 , hemingway researched his next work , " death in the afternoon " . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to write a comprehensive treatise on bull ##fighting , explaining the " tore ##ros " and " co ##rri ##das " complete with gloss ##aries and app ##end ##ices , because he believed bull ##fighting was " of great tragic interest , being literally of life and death . " [SEP]
[CLS] during the early 1930s , hemingway spent his winters in key west and summers in wyoming , where he found " the most beautiful country he had seen in the american west " and hunted deer , elk , and gr ##izzly bear . [SEP]
[CLS] he was joined there by dos pass ##os and in november 1930 , after bringing dos pass ##os to the train station in billings , montana , hemingway broke his arm in a car accident . [SEP]
[CLS] the surgeon tended the compound spiral fracture and bound the bone with kangaroo tend ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway was hospitalized for seven weeks , with pauline tending to him ; the nerves in his writing hand took as long as a year to heal , during which time he suffered intense pain . [SEP]
[CLS] his third son , gregory hancock hemingway , was born a year later on november 12 , 1931 , in kansas city . [SEP]
[CLS] pauline ' s uncle bought the couple a house in key west with a carriage house , the second floor of which was converted into a writing studio . [SEP]
[CLS] while in key west , hemingway frequented the local bar sloppy joe ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] he invited friends — including waldo pei ##rce , dos pass ##os , and max perkins — to join him on fishing trips and on an all - male expedition to the dry tor ##tu ##gas . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , he continued to travel to europe and to cuba , and — although in 1933 he wrote of key west , " we have a fine house here , and kids are all well " — mel ##low believes he " was plainly restless " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1933 , hemingway and pauline went on safari to east africa . [SEP]
[CLS] the 10 - week trip provided material for " green hills of africa " , as well as for the short stories " the snow ##s of ki ##lim ##an ##jar ##o " and " the short happy life of francis mac ##om ##ber " . [SEP]
[CLS] the couple visited mom ##bas ##a , nairobi , and mach ##ako ##s in kenya ; then moved on to tang ##any ##ika territory , where they hunted in the ser ##eng ##eti , around lake many ##ara , and west and southeast of present - day tara ##ng ##ire national park . [SEP]
[CLS] their guide was the noted " white hunter " philip percival who had guided theodore roosevelt on his 1909 safari . [SEP]
[CLS] during these travels , hemingway contracted am ##oe ##bic d ##yse ##nte ##ry that caused a pro ##la ##pse ##d int ##est ##ine , and he was evacuated by plane to nairobi , an experience reflected in " the snow ##s of ki ##lim ##an ##jar ##o " . [SEP]
[CLS] on hemingway ' s return to key west in early 1934 , he began work on " green hills of africa " , which he published in 1935 to mixed reviews . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway bought a boat in 1934 , named it the " pi ##lar " , and began sailing the caribbean . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1935 he first arrived at bi ##mini , where he spent a considerable amount of time . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period he also worked on " to have and have not " , published in 1937 while he was in spain , the only novel he wrote during the 1930s . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1937 , hemingway agreed to report on the spanish civil war for the north american newspaper alliance ( nana ) , arriving in spain in march with dutch filmmaker jo ##ris iv ##ens . [SEP]
[CLS] iv ##ens was filming " the spanish earth " , a propaganda film in support of the republican side . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted hemingway to replace john dos pass ##os as screenwriter , since dos pass ##os had left the project when his friend jose rob ##les was arrested and later executed . [SEP]
[CLS] the incident changed dos pass ##os ' initially positive opinion of the leftist republicans , creating a rift between him and hemingway , who later spread a rumor that dos pass ##os left spain out of coward ##ice . [SEP]
[CLS] he also rubbed shoulders with us volunteers fighting on the republican side , including the ace fighter pilot frank g . tin ##ker and robert hale mer ##rim ##an , leader of the abraham lincoln brigade . [SEP]
[CLS] journalist and writer martha gel ##lho ##rn , whom hemingway had met in key west the previous christmas ( 1936 ) , joined him in spain . [SEP]
[CLS] like hadley , martha was a st . louis native , and like pauline , she had worked for " vogue " in paris . [SEP]
[CLS] of martha , ke ##rt explains , " she never cater ##ed to him the way other women did " . [SEP]
[CLS] late in 1937 , while in madrid with martha , hemingway wrote his only play , " the fifth column " , as the city was being bomb ##arded by francois ##t forces . [SEP]
[CLS] he returned to key west for a few months , then back to spain twice in 1938 , where he was present at the battle of the e ##bro , the last republican stand , and he was among the british and american journalists who were some of the last to leave the battle as they crossed the river . [SEP]
[CLS] in early 1939 , hemingway crossed to cuba in his boat to live in the hotel am ##bos mundo ##s in havana . [SEP]
[CLS] this was the separation phase of a slow and painful split from pauline , which began when hemingway met martha gel ##lho ##rn . [SEP]
[CLS] martha soon joined him in cuba , and they rented " fin ##ca vi ##gia " ( " lookout farm " ) , a 15 acre property 15 mi from havana . [SEP]
[CLS] pauline and the children left hemingway that summer , after the family was reunited during a visit to wyoming ; when his divorce from pauline was finalized , he and martha were married on november 20 , 1940 in cheyenne , wyoming . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway moved his primary summer residence to ke ##tch ##um , idaho , just outside the newly built resort of sun valley , and moved his winter residence to cuba . [SEP]
[CLS] he had been disgusted when a parisian friend allowed his cats to eat from the table , but he became en ##amo ##red of cats in cuba and kept dozens of them on the property . [SEP]
[CLS] gel ##lho ##rn inspired him to write his most famous novel " for whom the bell toll ##s " , which he started in march 1939 and finished in july 1940 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was published in october 1940 . [SEP]
[CLS] his pattern was to move around while working on a manuscript , and he wrote " for whom the bell toll ##s " in cuba , wyoming , and sun valley . [SEP]
[CLS] it became a book - of - the - month club choice , sold half a million copies within months , was nominated for a pulitzer prize , and " triumphant ##ly re - established hemingway ' s literary reputation " in the words of meyer ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in january 1941 , martha was sent to china on assignment for " collier ' s " magazine . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway went with her , sending in dispatch ##es for the newspaper " pm " , but in general he disliked china . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2009 book suggests during that period he may have been recruited to work for soviet intelligence agents under the name " agent ar ##go " . [SEP]
[CLS] they returned to cuba before the declaration of war by the united states that december , when he convinced the cuban government to help him refit the " pi ##lar " , which he intended to use to ambush german submarines off the coast of cuba . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway was in europe from may 1944 to march 1945 . [SEP]
[CLS] when he arrived in london , he met " time " magazine correspondent mary welsh , with whom he became in ##fat ##uated . [SEP]
[CLS] martha had been forced to cross the atlantic in a ship filled with explosives because hemingway refused to help her get a press pass on a plane , and she arrived in london to find him hospitalized with a concussion from a car accident . [SEP]
[CLS] she was un ##sy ##mp ##ath ##etic to his plight ; she accused him of being a bully and told him that she was " through , absolutely finished " . [SEP]
[CLS] the last time that hemingway saw martha was in march 1945 as he was preparing to return to cuba , and their divorce was finalized later that year . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , he had asked mary welsh to marry him on their third meeting . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway accompanied the troops to the normandy landings wearing a large head bandage , according to meyer ##s , but he was considered " precious cargo " and not allowed ashore . [SEP]
[CLS] the landing craft came within sight of omaha beach before coming under enemy fire and turning back . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway later wrote in " collier ' s " that he could see " the first , second , third , fourth and fifth waves of landing troops lay where they had fallen , looking like so many heavily laden bundles on the flat pe ##bbly stretch between the sea and first cover " . [SEP]
[CLS] mel ##low explains that , on that first day , none of the correspondent ##s were allowed to land and hemingway was returned to the " dorothea di ##x " . [SEP]
[CLS] late in july , he attached himself to " the 22nd infantry regiment commanded by col . charles ' buck ' lan ##ham , as it drove toward paris " , and hemingway became de facto leader to a small band of village militia in ram ##bo ##uil ##let outside of paris . [SEP]
[CLS] paul fuss ##ell remarks : " hemingway got into considerable trouble playing infantry captain to a group of resistance people that he gathered because a correspondent is not supposed to lead troops , even if he does it well . " [SEP]
[CLS] this was in fact in contra ##vent ##ion of the geneva convention , and hemingway was brought up on formal charges ; he said that he " beat the rap " by claiming that he only offered advice . [SEP]
[CLS] on august 25 , he was present at the liberation of paris as a journalist ; contrary to the hemingway legend , he was not the first into the city , nor did he li ##ber ##ate the ri ##tz . [SEP]
[CLS] in paris , he visited sylvia beach and pablo picasso with mary welsh , who joined him there ; in a spirit of happiness , he for ##ga ##ve gertrude stein . [SEP]
[CLS] later that year , he observed heavy fighting in the battle of hurt ##gen forest . [SEP]
[CLS] on december 17 , 1944 , he had himself driven to luxembourg in spite of illness to cover the battle of the bulge . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as he arrived , however , lan ##ham handed him to the doctors , who hospitalized him with pneumonia ; he recovered a week later , but most of the fighting was over . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1947 , hemingway was awarded a bronze star for his bravery during world war ii . [SEP]
[CLS] he was recognized for having been " under fire in combat areas in order to obtain an accurate picture of conditions " , with the commendation that " through his talent of expression , mr . hemingway enabled readers to obtain a vivid picture of the difficulties and triumph ##s of the front - line soldier and his organization in combat " . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway said he " was out of business as a writer " from 1942 to 1945 during his residence in cuba . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1946 he married mary , who had an ec ##top ##ic pregnancy five months later . [SEP]
[CLS] the hemingway family suffered a series of accidents and health problems in the years following the war : in a 1945 car accident , he " smashed his knee " and sustained another " deep wound on his forehead " ; mary broke first her right ankle and then her left in successive skiing accidents . [SEP]
[CLS] a 1947 car accident left patrick with a head wound and severely ill . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway sank into depression as his literary friends began to die : in 1939 william butler ye ##ats and ford mad ##ox ford ; in 1940 scott fitzgerald ; in 1941 sherwood anderson and james joyce ; in 1946 gertrude stein ; and the following year in 1947 , max perkins , hemingway ' s long - time sc ##ri ##bner ' s editor and friend . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period , he suffered from severe headache ##s , high blood pressure , weight problems , and eventually diabetes — much of which was the result of previous accidents and many years of heavy drinking . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , in january 1946 , he began work on " the garden of eden " , finishing 800 pages by june . [SEP]
[CLS] during the post - war years , he also began work on a trilogy tentatively titled " the land " , " the sea " and " the air " , which he wanted to combine in one novel titled " the sea book " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , both projects stalled , and mel ##low says that hemingway ' s inability to continue was " a sy ##mpt ##om of his troubles " during these years . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1948 , hemingway and mary traveled to europe , staying in venice for several months . [SEP]
[CLS] while there , hemingway fell in love with the then 19 - year - old adrian ##a ivan ##cic ##h . [SEP]
[CLS] the plato ##nic love affair inspired the novel " across the river and into the trees " , written in cuba during a time of strife with mary , and published in 1950 to negative reviews . [SEP]
[CLS] the following year , furious at the critical reception of " across the river and into the trees " , he wrote the draft of " the old man and the sea " in eight weeks , saying that it was " the best i can write ever for all of my life " . [SEP]
[CLS] " the old man and the sea " became a book - of - the - month selection , made hemingway an international celebrity , and won the pulitzer prize in may 1952 , a month before he left for his second trip to africa . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1954 , while in africa , hemingway was almost fatally injured in two successive plane crashes . [SEP]
[CLS] he chartered a sights ##ee ##ing flight over the belgian congo as a christmas present to mary . [SEP]
[CLS] on their way to photograph mu ##rch ##ison falls from the air , the plane struck an abandoned utility pole and " crash landed in heavy brush " . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway ' s injuries included a head wound , while mary broke two ribs . [SEP]
[CLS] the next day , attempting to reach medical care in en ##te ##bbe , they boarded a second plane that exploded at take - off , with hemingway suffering burns and another concussion , this one serious enough to cause leaking of cerebral fluid . [SEP]
[CLS] they eventually arrived in en ##te ##bbe to find reporters covering the story of hemingway ' s death . [SEP]
[CLS] he brief ##ed the reporters and spent the next few weeks rec ##up ##era ##ting and reading his er ##rone ##ous ob ##it ##uaries . [SEP]
[CLS] despite his injuries , hemingway accompanied patrick and his wife on a planned fishing expedition in february , but pain caused him to be ira ##sc ##ible and difficult to get along with . [SEP]
[CLS] when a bush ##fire broke out , he was again injured , sustaining second degree burns on his legs , front torso , lips , left hand and right forearm . [SEP]
[CLS] months later in venice , mary reported to friends the full extent of hemingway ' s injuries : two cracked discs , a kidney and liver ru ##pt ##ure , a di ##sl ##oca ##ted shoulder and a broken skull . [SEP]
[CLS] the accidents may have pre ##ci ##pit ##ated the physical deterioration that was to follow . [SEP]
[CLS] after the plane crashes , hemingway , who had been " a thin ##ly controlled alcoholic throughout much of his life , drank more heavily than usual to combat the pain of his injuries . " [SEP]
[CLS] in october 1954 , hemingway received the nobel prize in literature . [SEP]
[CLS] he modest ##ly told the press that carl sand ##burg , isa ##k din ##ese ##n and bernard be ##ren ##son deserved the prize , but he gladly accepted the prize money . [SEP]
[CLS] mel ##low says hemingway " had coveted the nobel prize " , but when he won it , months after his plane accidents and the ensuing worldwide press coverage , " there must have been a lingering suspicion in hemingway ' s mind that his obituary notices had played a part in the academy ' s decision . " [SEP]
[CLS] because he was suffering pain from the african accidents , he decided against traveling to stockholm . [SEP]
[CLS] from the end of the year in 1955 to early 1956 , hemingway was bed ##rid ##den . [SEP]
[CLS] he was told to stop drinking to mit ##igate liver damage , advice he initially followed but then disregard ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] in october 1956 , he returned to europe and met basque writer pi ##o bar ##oja , who was seriously ill and died weeks later . [SEP]
[CLS] during the trip , hemingway became sick again and was treated for " high blood pressure , liver disease , and arte ##rio ##sc ##ler ##osis " . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 1956 , while staying in paris , he was reminded of trunks he had stored in the ri ##tz hotel in 1928 and never retrieved . [SEP]
[CLS] upon re - claiming and opening the trunks , hemingway discovered they were filled with notebook ##s and writing from his paris years . [SEP]
[CLS] excited about the discovery , when he returned to cuba in early 1957 , he began to shape the recovered work into his memoir " a move ##able feast " . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1959 he ended a period of intense activity : he finished " a move ##able feast " ( scheduled to be released the following year ) ; brought " true at first light " to 200 , 000 words ; added chapters to " the garden of eden " ; and worked on " islands in the stream " . [SEP]
[CLS] the last three were stored in a safe deposit box in havana , as he focused on the finishing touches for " a move ##able feast " . [SEP]
[CLS] author michael reynolds claims it was during this period that hemingway slid into depression , from which he was unable to recover . [SEP]
[CLS] the fin ##ca vi ##gia became crowded with guests and tourists , as hemingway , beginning to become unhappy with life there , considered a permanent move to idaho . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1959 he bought a home overlooking the big wood river , outside ke ##tch ##um , and left cuba — although he apparently remained on easy terms with the castro government , telling " the new york times " he was " delighted " with castro ' s overthrow of bat ##ista . [SEP]
[CLS] he was in cuba in november 1959 , between returning from pam ##pl ##ona and traveling west to idaho , and the following year for his 61 ##st birthday ; however , that year he and mary decided to leave after hearing the news that castro wanted to national ##ize property owned by americans and other foreign nationals . [SEP]
[CLS] on july 25 , 1960 , the hemingway ##s left cuba for the last time , leaving art and manuscripts in a bank vault in havana . [SEP]
[CLS] after the 1961 bay of pigs invasion , the fin ##ca vi ##gia was ex ##pro ##pr ##iated by the cuban government , complete with hemingway ' s collection of " four to six thousand books " . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway continued to re ##work the material that was published as " a move ##able feast " through the 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] in mid - 1959 , he visited spain to research a series of bull ##fighting articles commissioned by " life " magazine . [SEP]
[CLS] " life " wanted only 10 , 000 words , but the manuscript grew out of control . [SEP]
[CLS] he was unable to organize his writing for the first time in his life , so he asked a . e . hot ##chner to travel to cuba to help him . [SEP]
[CLS] hot ##chner helped him trim the " life " piece down to 40 , 000 words , and sc ##ri ##bner ' s agreed to a full - length book version ( " the dangerous summer " ) of almost 130 , 000 words . [SEP]
[CLS] hot ##chner found hemingway to be " unusually hesitant , di ##sor ##gan ##ized , and confused " , and suffering badly from failing eyes ##ight . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway and mary left cuba for the last time on july 25 , 1960 . [SEP]
[CLS] he set up a small office in his new york city apartment and attempted to work , but he left new york for good soon after . [SEP]
[CLS] he then traveled alone to spain to be photographed for the front cover of " life " magazine . [SEP]
[CLS] a few days later , the news reported that he was seriously ill and on the verge of dying , which panicked mary until she received a cable from him telling her , " reports false . [SEP]
[CLS] however , he " was " seriously ill and believed himself to be on the verge of a breakdown . [SEP]
[CLS] he was lonely and took to his bed for days , retreating into silence , despite having the first installment ##s of " the dangerous summer " published in " life " in september 1960 to good reviews . [SEP]
[CLS] in october , he left spain for new york , where he refused to leave mary ' s apartment on the pre ##text that he was being watched . [SEP]
[CLS] she quickly took him to idaho , where physician george sa ##vier ##s met them at the train . [SEP]
[CLS] at this time , hemingway was constantly worried about money and his safety . [SEP]
[CLS] he worried about his taxes and that he would never return to cuba to retrieve the manuscripts that he had left in a bank vault . [SEP]
[CLS] he became paranoid , thinking that the fbi was actively monitoring his movements in ke ##tch ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] the fbi had , in fact , opened a file on him during world war ii , when he used the " pi ##lar " to patrol the waters off cuba , and j . edgar hoover had an agent in havana watch him during the 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of november , mary was at her wits ' end , and sa ##vier ##s suggested that hemingway go to the mayo clinic in minnesota ; hemingway might have believed that he was to be treated there for hyper ##tension . [SEP]
[CLS] the fbi knew that hemingway was at the mayo clinic , as an agent later documented in a letter written in january 1961 . [SEP]
[CLS] he was checked in at the mayo clinic under sa ##vier ##s ' s name in order to maintain an ##ony ##mity . [SEP]
[CLS] meyer ##s writes that " an aura of secrecy surrounds hemingway ' s treatment at the mayo " but confirms that he was treated with electro ##con ##vu ##ls ##ive therapy as many as 15 times in december 1960 and was " released in ruins " in january 1961 . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway was back in ke ##tch ##um in april 1961 , three months after being released from the mayo clinic , when mary " found hemingway holding a shotgun " in the kitchen one morning . [SEP]
[CLS] she called sa ##vier ##s , who se ##date ##d him and admitted him to the sun valley hospital ; from there he was returned to the mayo for more electro ##sho ##ck treatments . [SEP]
[CLS] he was released in late june and arrived home in ke ##tch ##um on june 30 , and he " quite deliberately " shot himself with his favorite shotgun in the early morning hours of july 2 , 1961 . [SEP]
[CLS] he had unlocked the basement store ##room where his guns were kept , gone upstairs to the front entrance foyer , and shot himself with the " double - barrel ##ed shotgun that he had used so often it might have been a friend " . [SEP]
[CLS] mary called the sun valley hospital , and a doctor quickly arrived at the house who determined that hemingway " had died of a self - inflicted wound to the head " . [SEP]
[CLS] mary was se ##date ##d and taken to the hospital , returning home the next day where she cleaned the house and saw to the funeral and travel arrangements . [SEP]
[CLS] bern ##ice ke ##rt writes that it " did not seem to her a conscious lie " when she told the press that his death had been accidental . [SEP]
[CLS] in a press interview five years later , mary confirmed that he had shot himself . [SEP]
[CLS] family and friends flew to ke ##tch ##um for the funeral , off ##icia ##ted by the local catholic priest , who believed that the death had been accidental . [SEP]
[CLS] an altar boy faint ##ed at the head of the casket during the funeral , and hemingway ' s brother leicester wrote : " it seemed to me ernest would have approved of it all . " [SEP]
[CLS] he is buried in the ke ##tch ##um cemetery . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway ' s behavior during his final years had been similar to that of his father before he killed himself ; his father may have had the genetic disease hem ##och ##rom ##ato ##sis , whereby the inability to meta ##bol ##ize iron cu ##lm ##inates in mental and physical deterioration . [SEP]
[CLS] medical records made available in 1991 confirm that hemingway had been diagnosed with hem ##och ##rom ##ato ##sis in early 1961 . [SEP]
[CLS] his sister ursula and his brother leicester also killed themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway ' s health was further compromised by being a heavy drink ##er for most of his life . [SEP]
[CLS] " the new york times " wrote in 1926 of hemingway ' s first novel , " no amount of analysis can convey the quality of " the sun also rises " . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a truly gripping story , told in a lean , hard , athletic narrative prose that puts more literary english to shame . " [SEP]
[CLS] " the sun also rises " is written in the spare , tight prose that made hemingway famous , and , according to james na ##gel , " changed the nature of american writing . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1954 , when hemingway was awarded the nobel prize for literature , it was for " his mastery of the art of narrative , most recently demonstrated in " the old man and the sea " , and for the influence that he has ex ##erted on contemporary style . " [SEP]
[CLS] henry louis gates believes hemingway ' s style was fundamentally shaped " in reaction to his experience of world war " . [SEP]
[CLS] after world war i , he and other modernist ##s " lost faith in the central institutions of western civilization " by reacting against the elaborate style of 19th - century writers and by creating a style " in which meaning is established through dialogue , through action , and silence ##s — a fiction in which nothing crucial — or at least very little — is stated explicitly . " [SEP]
[CLS] because he began as a writer of short stories , baker believes hemingway learned to " get the most from the least , how to pr ##une language , how to multi ##ply int ##ens ##ities and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth . " [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway called his style the ice ##berg theory : the facts float above water ; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight . [SEP]
[CLS] the concept of the ice ##berg theory is sometimes referred to as the " theory of om ##iss ##ion " . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing ( such as nick adams fishing in " the big two - hearted river " ) though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface ( nick adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about anything else ) . [SEP]
[CLS] paul smith writes that hemingway ' s first stories , collected as " in our time " , showed he was still experimenting with his writing style . [SEP]
[CLS] he avoided complicated syntax . [SEP]
[CLS] about 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences — a child ##like syntax without sub ##ord ##ination . [SEP]
[CLS] jackson benson believes hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in general — not only about his life . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , benson post ##ulates that hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with " what if " scenarios : " what if i were wounded in such a way that i could not sleep at night ? [SEP]
[CLS] what if i were wounded and made crazy , what would happen if i were sent back to the front ? " [SEP]
[CLS] writing in " the art of the short story " , hemingway explains : " a few things i have found to be true . [SEP]
[CLS] if you leave out important things or events that you know about , the story is strengthened . [SEP]
[CLS] if you leave or skip something because you do not know it , the story will be worthless . [SEP]
[CLS] the test of any story is how very good the stuff that you , not your editors , om ##it . " [SEP]
[CLS] the simplicity of the prose is dec ##eptive . [SEP]
[CLS] zoe tr ##od ##d believes hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to henry james ' s observation that world war i had " used up words " . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway offers a " multi - focal " photographic reality . [SEP]
[CLS] his ice ##berg theory of om ##iss ##ion is the foundation on which he builds . [SEP]
[CLS] the syntax , which lacks sub ##ord ##inating conjunction ##s , creates static sentences . [SEP]
[CLS] the photographic " snaps ##hot " style creates a col ##lage of images . [SEP]
[CLS] many types of internal pun ##ct ##uation ( colon ##s , semi ##col ##ons , dash ##es , parentheses ) are omitted in favor of short dec ##lar ##ative sentences . [SEP]
[CLS] the sentences build on each other , as events build to create a sense of the whole . [SEP]
[CLS] multiple strands exist in one story ; an " embedded text " bridges to a different angle . [SEP]
[CLS] he also uses other cinematic techniques of " cutting " quickly from one scene to the next ; or of " sp ##lic ##ing " a scene into another . [SEP]
[CLS] intentional om ##iss ##ions allow the reader to fill the gap , as though responding to instructions from the author , and create three - dimensional prose . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway habit ##ually used the word " and " in place of com ##mas . [SEP]
[CLS] this use of poly ##sy ##nde ##ton may serve to convey im ##media ##cy . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway ' s poly ##sy ##nde ##tonic sentence — or in later works his use of subordinate clauses — uses conjunction ##s to ju ##xt ##ap ##ose startling visions and images . [SEP]
[CLS] benson compares them to hai ##kus . [SEP]
[CLS] many of hemingway ' s followers mis ##int ##er ##pre ##ted his lead and frowned upon all expression of emotion ; saul bell ##ow sat ##iri ##zed this style as " do you have emotions ? [SEP]
[CLS] however , hemingway ' s intent was not to eliminate emotion , but to portray it more scientific ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway thought it would be easy , and pointless , to describe emotions ; he sculpted col ##lage ##s of images in order to grasp " the real thing , the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or , with luck and if you stated it purely enough , always " . [SEP]
[CLS] this use of an image as an objective co ##rre ##lative is characteristic of ezra pound , t . s . eliot , james joyce , and pro ##ust . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway ' s letters refer to pro ##ust ' s " remembrance of things past " several times over the years , and indicate he read the book at least twice . [SEP]
[CLS] the popularity of hemingway ' s work depends on its themes of love , war , wilderness , and loss , all of which are strongly evident in the body of work . [SEP]
[CLS] these are recurring themes in american literature , and are quite clearly evident in hemingway ' s work . [SEP]
[CLS] critic leslie fi ##ed ##ler sees the theme he defines as " the sacred land " — the american west — extended in hemingway ' s work to include mountains in spain , switzerland and africa , and to the streams of michigan . [SEP]
[CLS] the american west is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the " hotel montana " in " the sun also rises " and " for whom the bell toll ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] according to st ##olt ##z ##fus and fi ##ed ##ler , in hemingway ' s work , nature is a place for rebirth and rest ; and it is where the hunter or fisherman might experience a moment of trans ##cend ##ence at the moment they kill their prey . [SEP]
[CLS] nature is where men exist without women : men fish ; men hunt ; men find redemption in nature . [SEP]
[CLS] although hemingway does write about sports , such as fishing , carlos baker notes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport . [SEP]
[CLS] at its core , much of hemingway ' s work can be viewed in the light of american natural ##ism , evident in detailed descriptions such as those in " big two - hearted river " . [SEP]
[CLS] fi ##ed ##ler believes hemingway in ##vert ##s the american literary theme of the evil " dark woman " versus the good " light woman " . [SEP]
[CLS] the dark woman — brett ashley of " the sun also rises " — is a goddess ; the light woman — margot mac ##om ##ber of " the short happy life of francis mac ##om ##ber " — is a murder ##ess . [SEP]
[CLS] robert sc ##holes admits that early hemingway stories , such as " a very short story " , present " a male character favorably and a female un ##fa ##vor ##ably " . [SEP]
[CLS] according to ren ##a sanders ##on , early hemingway critics lauded his male - cent ##ric world of masculine pursuits , and the fiction divided women into " cast ##rator ##s or love - slaves " . [SEP]
[CLS] feminist critics attacked hemingway as " public enemy number one " , although more recent re - evaluation ##s of his work " have given new visibility to hemingway ' s female characters ( and their strengths ) and have revealed his own sensitivity to gender issues , thus casting doubts on the old assumption that his writings were one - sided ##ly masculine . " [SEP]
[CLS] nina bay ##m believes that brett ashley and margot mac ##om ##ber " are the two outstanding examples of hemingway ' s ' bitch women . [SEP]
[CLS] the theme of women and death is evident in stories as early as " indian camp " . [SEP]
[CLS] the theme of death per ##me ##ates hemingway ' s work . [SEP]
[CLS] young believes the emphasis in " indian camp " was not so much on the woman who gives birth or the father who kills himself , but on nick adams who witnesses these events as a child , and becomes a " badly scarred and nervous young man " . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway sets the events in " indian camp " that shape the adams persona . [SEP]
[CLS] young believes " indian camp " holds the " master key " to " what its author was up to for some thirty - five years of his writing career " . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##olt ##z ##fus considers hemingway ' s work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in existent ##ial ##ism : if " nothing ##ness " is embraced , then redemption is achieved at the moment of death . [SEP]
[CLS] those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life . [SEP]
[CLS] francis mac ##om ##ber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic ; the bull ##fighter in the co ##rri ##da represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity . [SEP]
[CLS] in his paper " the uses of authenticity : hemingway and the literary field " , tim ##o muller writes that hemingway ' s fiction is successful because the characters live an " authentic life " , and the " soldiers , fisher ##s , boxers and back ##woods ##men are among the arch ##ety ##pes of authenticity in modern literature " . [SEP]
[CLS] the theme of em ##as ##cula ##tion is prevalent in hemingway ' s work , most notably in " the sun also rises " . [SEP]
[CLS] em ##as ##cula ##tion , according to fi ##ed ##ler , is a result of a generation of wounded soldiers ; and of a generation in which women such as brett gained emancipation . [SEP]
[CLS] this also applies to the minor character , frances cl ##yne , co ##hn ' s girlfriend in the beginning in the book . [SEP]
[CLS] her character supports the theme not only because the idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact she had on co ##hn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times . [SEP]
[CLS] baker believes hemingway ' s work emphasizes the " natural " versus the " unnatural " . [SEP]
[CLS] in " alpine id ##yl ##l " the " unnatural ##ness " of skiing in the high country late spring snow is ju ##xt ##ap ##osed against the " unnatural ##ness " of the peasant who allowed his wife ' s dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter . [SEP]
[CLS] the skier ##s and peasant retreat to the valley to the " natural " spring for redemption . [SEP]
[CLS] susan bee ##gel has written that some more recent critics — writing through the lens of a more modern social and cultural context several decades after hemingway ' s death , and more than half a century after his novels were first published — have characterized the social era portrayed in his fiction as mis ##ogy ##nist ##ic and homo ##phobic . [SEP]
[CLS] in her 1996 essay , " critical reception " , bee ##gel analyzed four decades of hemingway criticism and found that " critics interested in multicultural ##ism " , particularly in the 1980s , simply ignored hemingway , although some " apologetic ##s " have been written . [SEP]
[CLS] typical , according to bee ##gel , is an analysis of hemingway ' s 1926 novel , " the sun also rises " , in which a critic contend ##ed : " hemingway never lets the reader forget that co ##hn is a jew , not an una ##tt ##ractive character who happens to be a jew but a character who is una ##tt ##ractive because he is a jew . " [SEP]
[CLS] also during the 1980s , according to bee ##gel , criticism was published that focused on investigating the " horror of homosexuality " and the " racism " typical of the social era portrayed in hemingway ' s fiction . [SEP]
[CLS] in an overall assessment of hemingway ' s work bee ##gel has written : " throughout his remarkable body of fiction , he tells the truth about human fear , guilt , betrayal , violence , cruelty , drunken ##ness , hunger , greed , ap ##athy , ecstasy , tenderness , love and lust . " [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway ' s legacy to american literature is his style : writers who came after him em ##ulated it or avoided it . [SEP]
[CLS] after his reputation was established with the publication of " the sun also rises " , he became the spokesperson for the post - world war i generation , having established a style to follow . [SEP]
[CLS] his books were burned in berlin in 1933 , " as being a monument of modern decade ##nce " , and di ##sa ##vo ##wed by his parents as " fi ##lth " . [SEP]
[CLS] reynolds asserts the legacy is that " hemingway left stories and novels so stark ##ly moving that some have become part of our cultural heritage . " [SEP]
[CLS] benson believes the details of hemingway ' s life have become a " prime vehicle for exploitation " , resulting in a hemingway industry . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway scholar halle ##ng ##ren believes the " hard boiled style " and the mach ##ism ##o must be separated from the author himself . [SEP]
[CLS] benson agrees , describing him as intro ##verted and private as j . d . sal ##inger , although hemingway masked his nature with bragg ##ado ##cio . [SEP]
[CLS] during world war ii , sal ##inger met and corresponded with hemingway , whom he acknowledged as an influence . [SEP]
[CLS] in a letter to hemingway , sal ##inger claimed their talks " had given him his only hopeful minutes of the entire war " and joking ##ly " named himself national chairman of the hemingway fan clubs . " [SEP]
[CLS] the extent of hemingway ' s influence is seen in the tribute ##s and echoes of his fiction in popular culture . [SEP]
[CLS] a minor planet , discovered in 1978 by soviet astronomer nikolai cher ##ny ##kh , was named for him ( 365 ##6 hemingway ) ; ray brad ##bury wrote " the ki ##lim ##an ##jar ##o device " , with hemingway transported to the top of mount ki ##lim ##an ##jar ##o ; the 1993 motion picture " wrestling ernest hemingway " , about the friendship of two retired men , irish and cuban , in a seaside town in florida , starred robert duval ##l , richard harris , shirley mac ##lain ##e , sandra bullock , and piper laurie .
