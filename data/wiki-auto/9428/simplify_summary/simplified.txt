meanwhile , he asked mary welsh to marry him .
hemingway accompanied the troops to the normandy landings wearing a large head bandage , according to meyers , but he was considered " precious cargo " and not allowed ashore .

" life " wanted only 10,000 words , but the manuscript grew out of control .

hotchner helped him trim the " life " piece down to 40,000 words , and scribner 's agreed to a full-length book version saying " the dangerous summer "arth .

a few days later , the news reported that he was seriously ill and on the verge of dying , which panicked mary until she received a cable from him telling her , " reports false .
however , he " was seriously ill and believed himself to be on the verge of a breakdown .
he was lonely and took to his bed for days , and he was quiet .
in october , he left spain for new york .
she quickly took him to idaho , where physician george saviers met them at the train .
hemingway was constantly worried about money and his safety .
he worried about his taxes and that he would never return to cuba to get the manuscripts that he had left in a bank vault .
he became paranoid , thinking that the fbi was actively monitoring his movements in ketchum .
the fbi had opened a file on him during world war ii .
by the end of november , mary was at her wits ' end .
hemingway was at the mayo clinic .
he was checked in at the mayo clinic under saviers 's name in order to maintain anonymity .
meyers writes that " an aura of secrecy surrounds hemingway 's treatment at the mayo " .
hemingway was back in ketchum in april 1961 .
she called saviers , who sedated him and admitted him to the sun valley hospital .
he was released in late june and arrived home in june 30 , and he " quite deliberately " shot himself with his shotgun in the early morning hours of july 2,1961 .
he had unlocked the basement storeroom where his guns were kept , gone upstairs to the front entrance foyer , and shot himself with the " double-barreled shotgun that he had used so often it might have been a friend " .
mary called the sun valley hospital .
she returned home the next day where she cleaned the house and saw to the funeral and travel arrangements .
bernice kert writes that it " did not seem to her a conscious lie " when she told the press that his death had been accidental .
in a press interview five years later , mary confirmed that he had shot himself .
they flew to ketchum for the funeral .
hemingway 's brother , leicester , wrote : " it seemed to me ernest would have approved of it all . "
he is buried in the cemetery of ketchum .
hemingway 's behavior during his last years had been similar to that of his father before he killed himself .
hemingway was diagnosed with hemochromatosis in early 1961 .
his sister ursula and his brother leicester also killed themselves .
hemingway was a heavy drinker for most of his life .
hemingway 's first novel , " no amount of analysis can convey the quality of " the sun also rises " .
it is a truly gripping story , written in a lean , hard , athletic narrative prose puts more literary english to shame . "
hemingway wrote " the sun also rises " .
hemingway was awarded the nobel prize in literature in 1954 .
henry louis gates believes hemingway 's style was fundamentally shaped " in reaction to his experience of world war " .
after world war i , he and other modernists " lost faith in the central institutions of western civilization " .
he began as a writer of short stories .
hemingway called his style the iceberg theory : the facts float above water ; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight .
the iceberg theory is sometimes called the " theory of omission " .
hemingway believed the writer could describe one thingtish like nick adams fishing in " the big two-hearted river "arth .
hemingway 's first book , " in our time " , showed he was experimenting with his writing style .
he avoided complicated syntax .
about 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences .
hemingway believes hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in general – not only about his life .
hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with " what if i were wounded in such a way that i could not sleep at night ?
what if i were wounded and made crazy , what would happen if i were sent back to the front ? "
hemingway wrote " the art of the short story " .
if you leave out important things or events that you know about , the story is strengthened .
if you leave or skip something because you do not know it , the story will be worthless .
the test of any story is how very good the stuff you , not your editors , omit . "
the simplicity of the prose is deceptive .
zoe trodd believes hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to henry james 's observation that world war i had " used up words " .
hemingway offers a " multi focal " photographic reality .
his iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which he builds .
the syntax , which lacks subordinating conjunctions , creates static sentences .
the photographic " snapshot " style creates a collage of images .
many types of punctuationuationuation nasals , semicolons , dashes , parentheses edna and other types of punctuation are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences .
the sentences build on each other , as events build to create a sense of the whole .
in one story , there are several strands in each story .
he also uses other cinematic techniques of " cutting " quickly from one scene to the next , or of " splicing " a scene into another .
intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap , as though responding to instructions from the author , and create three-dimensional prose .
hemingway habitually used the word " and " in place of commas .
this use of polysyndeton may serve to convey immediacy .
hemingway 's polysyndetonic sentence , or in later works his use of subordinate clauses , uses conjunctions to juxtapose startling visions and images .
he compares them to haikus .
many of hemingway 's followers misinterpreted his lead and frowned upon all expression of emotion ; saul bellow satirized this style as " do you have emotions ?
hemingway 's intent was to eliminate emotion , but to portray it more scientifically .
hemingway thought it would be easy , and pointless , to describe emotions .
this use of an image as an objective correlative is characteristic of ezra pound , t . s . eliot , james joyce , and proust .
hemingway 's letters refer to proust 's " remembrance of things past " several times over the years .
hemingway 's work depends on its themes of love , war , wilderness , and loss .
these are recurring themes in american literature .
this extended in hemingway 's work to include mountains in spain , switzerland and africa , and to the streams of michigan .
the american west is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the " hotel montana " in " the sun also rises " and " for whom the bell tolls " .
hemingway 's work says that nature is a place for rebirth and rest .
nature is where men live without women : men fish ; men hunt ; men and men find redemption in nature .
although hemingway does write about sports , such as fishing , carlos baker notes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport .
hemingway 's work can be seen in the light of american naturalism .
fiedler believes hemingway inverts the american literary theme of the evil " dark woman " versus the good " light woman " .
she is the light woman — margot macomber of " the short happy life of francis macomber " — is a murderess .
some early hemingway stories , such as " a very short story " , present " a male character favorably and a female unfavorably " .
hemingway said that early hemingway hemingway -lrb- early -rrb- liked his male-centric world of male pursuits , and the fiction divided women into " castrators or love-slaves " .
hemingway 's works " have given new visibility to hemingway 's female charactersiciencies and their strengths strengths strengths strengths strengthschouse and have revealed his sensitivity to gender issues .
nina baym believes that brett ashley and margot macomber are the two best examples of hemingway 's ' bitch women .
the theme of women and death is evident in stories as early as " indian camp " .
hemingway wrote the theme of death .
young believes the emphasis in " indian camp " was not so much on the woman who gives birth or the father who kills himself , but on nick adams who witnesses these events as a child , and becomes a " badly scarred and nervous young man " .
hemingway sets the events in " indian camp " that shape the adams persona .
young believes " indian camp " holds the master key to " what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career " .
