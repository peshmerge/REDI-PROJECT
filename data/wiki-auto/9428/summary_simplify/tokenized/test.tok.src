[CLS] however , in march , she wrote that she had become engaged to an italian officer . [SEP]
[CLS] biographer jeffrey meyer ##s states in his book " hemingway : a biography " that hemingway was devastated by agnes ' s rejection , and in future relationships , he followed a pattern of abandoning a wife before she abandoned him . [SEP]

[CLS] when st . louis native hadley richardson came to chicago to visit the sister of hemingway ' s roommate , hemingway became in ##fat ##uated . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the age difference , hadley , who had grown up with an over ##pro ##tec ##tive mother , seemed less mature than usual for a young woman her age . [SEP]

[CLS] they wanted to visit rome , but sherwood anderson convinced them to visit paris instead , writing letters of introduction for the young couple . [SEP]
[CLS] they were married on september 3 , 1921 ; two months later , hemingway was hired as foreign correspondent for the " toronto star " , and the couple left for paris . [SEP]
[CLS] of hemingway ' s marriage to hadley , meyer ##s claims : " with hadley , hemingway achieved everything he had hoped for with agnes : the love of a beautiful woman , a comfortable income , a life in europe . " [SEP]
[CLS] carlos baker , hemingway ' s first biographer , believes that while anderson suggested paris because " the monetary exchange rate " made it an inexpensive place to live , more importantly it was where " the most interesting people in the world " lived . [SEP]
[CLS] in paris , hemingway met american writer and art collector gertrude stein , irish novelist james joyce , american poet ezra pound ( who " could help a young writer up the run ##gs of a career " ) and other writers . [SEP]
[CLS] stein , who was the bastion of modernism in paris , became hemingway ' s mentor and god ##mot ##her to his son jack ; she introduced him to the ex ##pa ##tri ##ate artists and writers of the mont ##par ##nas ##se quarter , whom she referred to as the " lost generation " — a term hemingway popularized with the publication of " the sun also rises " .

[CLS] when " in our time " was published in 1925 , the dust jacket bore comments from ford . [SEP]
[CLS] " indian camp " received considerable praise ; ford saw it as an important early story by a young writer , and critics in the united states praised hemingway for rein ##vi ##gor ##ating the short story genre with his crisp style and use of dec ##lar ##ative sentences . [SEP]
[CLS] fitzgerald had published " the great ga ##ts ##by " the same year : hemingway read it , liked it , and decided his next work had to be a novel . [SEP]
[CLS] it is at this time that he began to be referred to as " papa " , even by much older friends . [SEP]
[CLS] hadley would much later recall that hemingway had his own nickname ##s for everyone , and that he often did things for his friends ; she suggested that he liked to be looked up to . [SEP]
[CLS] the hemingway ##s returned to pam ##pl ##ona in 1924 and a third time in june 1925 ; that year they brought with them a group of american and british ex ##pa ##tri ##ates : hemingway ' s michigan boy ##hood friend bill smith , donald ogden stewart , lady duff t ##wy ##sden ( recently divorced ) , her lover pat guthrie , and harold lo ##eb .

[CLS] pauline p ##fe ##iff ##er joined them in january and against hadley ' s advice , urged hemingway to sign a contract with sc ##ri ##bner ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] the manuscript arrived in new york in april ; he corrected the final proof in paris in august 1926 , and sc ##ri ##bner ' s published the novel in october . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway himself later wrote to his editor max perkins that the " point of the book " was not so much about a generation being lost , but that " the earth ab ##ide ##th forever " ; he believed the characters in " the sun also rises " may have been " battered " but were not lost . [SEP]
[CLS] they honeymoon ##ed in le gr ##au - du - roi , where he contracted ant ##hra ##x , and he planned his next collection of short stories , " men without women " , which was published in october 1927 , and included his boxing story " fifty grand " . [SEP]

[CLS] in the winter , he was in new york with bum ##by , about to board a train to florida , when he received a cable telling him that his father had killed himself . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway was devastated , having earlier written to his father telling him not to worry about financial difficulties ; the letter arrived minutes after the suicide . [SEP]
[CLS] he realized how hadley must have felt after her own father ' s suicide in 1903 , and he commented , " i ' ll probably go the same way . " [SEP]
[CLS] upon his return to key west in december , hemingway worked on the draft of " a farewell to arms " before leaving for france in january . [SEP]
[CLS] the serial ##ization in " sc ##ri ##bner ' s magazine " was scheduled to begin in may , but as late as april , hemingway was still working on the ending , which he may have re ##written as many as seventeen times . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to write a comprehensive treatise on bull ##fighting , explaining the " tore ##ros " and " co ##rri ##das " complete with gloss ##aries and app ##end ##ices , because he believed bull ##fighting was " of great tragic interest , being literally of life and death . " [SEP]
[CLS] during the early 1930s , hemingway spent his winters in key west and summers in wyoming , where he found " the most beautiful country he had seen in the american west " and hunted deer , elk , and gr ##izzly bear . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway was hospitalized for seven weeks , with pauline tending to him ; the nerves in his writing hand took as long as a year to heal , during which time he suffered intense pain . [SEP]
[CLS] pauline ' s uncle bought the couple a house in key west with a carriage house , the second floor of which was converted into a writing studio . [SEP]
[CLS] the couple visited mom ##bas ##a , nairobi , and mach ##ako ##s in kenya ; then moved on to tang ##any ##ika territory , where they hunted in the ser ##eng ##eti , around lake many ##ara , and west and southeast of present - day tara ##ng ##ire national park . [SEP]
[CLS] during these travels , hemingway contracted am ##oe ##bic d ##yse ##nte ##ry that caused a pro ##la ##pse ##d int ##est ##ine , and he was evacuated by plane to nairobi , an experience reflected in " the snow ##s of ki ##lim ##an ##jar ##o " . [SEP]
[CLS] on hemingway ' s return to key west in early 1934 , he began work on " green hills of africa " , which he published in 1935 to mixed reviews . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1935 he first arrived at bi ##mini , where he spent a considerable amount of time . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period he also worked on " to have and have not " , published in 1937 while he was in spain , the only novel he wrote during the 1930s . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted hemingway to replace john dos pass ##os as screenwriter , since dos pass ##os had left the project when his friend jose rob ##les was arrested and later executed . [SEP]
[CLS] the incident changed dos pass ##os ' initially positive opinion of the leftist republicans , creating a rift between him and hemingway , who later spread a rumor that dos pass ##os left spain out of coward ##ice . [SEP]
[CLS] he also rubbed shoulders with us volunteers fighting on the republican side , including the ace fighter pilot frank g . tin ##ker and robert hale mer ##rim ##an , leader of the abraham lincoln brigade . [SEP]
[CLS] journalist and writer martha gel ##lho ##rn , whom hemingway had met in key west the previous christmas ( 1936 ) , joined him in spain . [SEP]
[CLS] he returned to key west for a few months , then back to spain twice in 1938 , where he was present at the battle of the e ##bro , the last republican stand , and he was among the british and american journalists who were some of the last to leave the battle as they crossed the river . [SEP]
[CLS] pauline and the children left hemingway that summer , after the family was reunited during a visit to wyoming ; when his divorce from pauline was finalized , he and martha were married on november 20 , 1940 in cheyenne , wyoming . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway moved his primary summer residence to ke ##tch ##um , idaho , just outside the newly built resort of sun valley , and moved his winter residence to cuba . [SEP]
[CLS] he had been disgusted when a parisian friend allowed his cats to eat from the table , but he became en ##amo ##red of cats in cuba and kept dozens of them on the property . [SEP]
[CLS] it became a book - of - the - month club choice , sold half a million copies within months , was nominated for a pulitzer prize , and " triumphant ##ly re - established hemingway ' s literary reputation " in the words of meyer ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway went with her , sending in dispatch ##es for the newspaper " pm " , but in general he disliked china . [SEP]
[CLS] they returned to cuba before the declaration of war by the united states that december , when he convinced the cuban government to help him refit the " pi ##lar " , which he intended to use to ambush german submarines off the coast of cuba . [SEP]
[CLS] when he arrived in london , he met " time " magazine correspondent mary welsh , with whom he became in ##fat ##uated . [SEP]
[CLS] martha had been forced to cross the atlantic in a ship filled with explosives because hemingway refused to help her get a press pass on a plane , and she arrived in london to find him hospitalized with a concussion from a car accident . [SEP]
[CLS] the last time that hemingway saw martha was in march 1945 as he was preparing to return to cuba , and their divorce was finalized later that year . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway accompanied the troops to the normandy landings wearing a large head bandage , according to meyer ##s , but he was considered " precious cargo " and not allowed ashore . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway later wrote in " collier ' s " that he could see " the first , second , third , fourth and fifth waves of landing troops lay where they had fallen , looking like so many heavily laden bundles on the flat pe ##bbly stretch between the sea and first cover " . [SEP]
[CLS] mel ##low explains that , on that first day , none of the correspondent ##s were allowed to land and hemingway was returned to the " dorothea di ##x " . [SEP]
[CLS] late in july , he attached himself to " the 22nd infantry regiment commanded by col . charles ' buck ' lan ##ham , as it drove toward paris " , and hemingway became de facto leader to a small band of village militia in ram ##bo ##uil ##let outside of paris . [SEP]
[CLS] paul fuss ##ell remarks : " hemingway got into considerable trouble playing infantry captain to a group of resistance people that he gathered because a correspondent is not supposed to lead troops , even if he does it well . " [SEP]
[CLS] this was in fact in contra ##vent ##ion of the geneva convention , and hemingway was brought up on formal charges ; he said that he " beat the rap " by claiming that he only offered advice . [SEP]
[CLS] on august 25 , he was present at the liberation of paris as a journalist ; contrary to the hemingway legend , he was not the first into the city , nor did he li ##ber ##ate the ri ##tz . [SEP]
[CLS] in paris , he visited sylvia beach and pablo picasso with mary welsh , who joined him there ; in a spirit of happiness , he for ##ga ##ve gertrude stein . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as he arrived , however , lan ##ham handed him to the doctors , who hospitalized him with pneumonia ; he recovered a week later , but most of the fighting was over . [SEP]
[CLS] he was recognized for having been " under fire in combat areas in order to obtain an accurate picture of conditions " , with the commendation that " through his talent of expression , mr . hemingway enabled readers to obtain a vivid picture of the difficulties and triumph ##s of the front - line soldier and his organization in combat " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1946 he married mary , who had an ec ##top ##ic pregnancy five months later . [SEP]
[CLS] the hemingway family suffered a series of accidents and health problems in the years following the war : in a 1945 car accident , he " smashed his knee " and sustained another " deep wound on his forehead " ; mary broke first her right ankle and then her left in successive skiing accidents . [SEP]
[CLS] a 1947 car accident left patrick with a head wound and severely ill . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway sank into depression as his literary friends began to die : in 1939 william butler ye ##ats and ford mad ##ox ford ; in 1940 scott fitzgerald ; in 1941 sherwood anderson and james joyce ; in 1946 gertrude stein ; and the following year in 1947 , max perkins , hemingway ' s long - time sc ##ri ##bner ' s editor and friend . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period , he suffered from severe headache ##s , high blood pressure , weight problems , and eventually diabetes — much of which was the result of previous accidents and many years of heavy drinking . [SEP]
[CLS] during the post - war years , he also began work on a trilogy tentatively titled " the land " , " the sea " and " the air " , which he wanted to combine in one novel titled " the sea book " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , both projects stalled , and mel ##low says that hemingway ' s inability to continue was " a sy ##mpt ##om of his troubles " during these years . [SEP]
[CLS] the plato ##nic love affair inspired the novel " across the river and into the trees " , written in cuba during a time of strife with mary , and published in 1950 to negative reviews . [SEP]
[CLS] the following year , furious at the critical reception of " across the river and into the trees " , he wrote the draft of " the old man and the sea " in eight weeks , saying that it was " the best i can write ever for all of my life " . [SEP]
[CLS] " the old man and the sea " became a book - of - the - month selection , made hemingway an international celebrity , and won the pulitzer prize in may 1952 , a month before he left for his second trip to africa . [SEP]
[CLS] the next day , attempting to reach medical care in en ##te ##bbe , they boarded a second plane that exploded at take - off , with hemingway suffering burns and another concussion , this one serious enough to cause leaking of cerebral fluid . [SEP]
[CLS] despite his injuries , hemingway accompanied patrick and his wife on a planned fishing expedition in february , but pain caused him to be ira ##sc ##ible and difficult to get along with . [SEP]
[CLS] when a bush ##fire broke out , he was again injured , sustaining second degree burns on his legs , front torso , lips , left hand and right forearm . [SEP]
[CLS] months later in venice , mary reported to friends the full extent of hemingway ' s injuries : two cracked discs , a kidney and liver ru ##pt ##ure , a di ##sl ##oca ##ted shoulder and a broken skull . [SEP]
[CLS] he modest ##ly told the press that carl sand ##burg , isa ##k din ##ese ##n and bernard be ##ren ##son deserved the prize , but he gladly accepted the prize money . [SEP]
[CLS] mel ##low says hemingway " had coveted the nobel prize " , but when he won it , months after his plane accidents and the ensuing worldwide press coverage , " there must have been a lingering suspicion in hemingway ' s mind that his obituary notices had played a part in the academy ' s decision . " [SEP]
[CLS] he was told to stop drinking to mit ##igate liver damage , advice he initially followed but then disregard ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] during the trip , hemingway became sick again and was treated for " high blood pressure , liver disease , and arte ##rio ##sc ##ler ##osis " . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 1956 , while staying in paris , he was reminded of trunks he had stored in the ri ##tz hotel in 1928 and never retrieved . [SEP]
[CLS] upon re - claiming and opening the trunks , hemingway discovered they were filled with notebook ##s and writing from his paris years . [SEP]
[CLS] excited about the discovery , when he returned to cuba in early 1957 , he began to shape the recovered work into his memoir " a move ##able feast " . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1959 he ended a period of intense activity : he finished " a move ##able feast " ( scheduled to be released the following year ) ; brought " true at first light " to 200 , 000 words ; added chapters to " the garden of eden " ; and worked on " islands in the stream " . [SEP]
[CLS] the last three were stored in a safe deposit box in havana , as he focused on the finishing touches for " a move ##able feast " . [SEP]
[CLS] author michael reynolds claims it was during this period that hemingway slid into depression , from which he was unable to recover . [SEP]
[CLS] the fin ##ca vi ##gia became crowded with guests and tourists , as hemingway , beginning to become unhappy with life there , considered a permanent move to idaho . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1959 he bought a home overlooking the big wood river , outside ke ##tch ##um , and left cuba — although he apparently remained on easy terms with the castro government , telling " the new york times " he was " delighted " with castro ' s overthrow of bat ##ista . [SEP]
[CLS] he was in cuba in november 1959 , between returning from pam ##pl ##ona and traveling west to idaho , and the following year for his 61 ##st birthday ; however , that year he and mary decided to leave after hearing the news that castro wanted to national ##ize property owned by americans and other foreign nationals . [SEP]
[CLS] after the 1961 bay of pigs invasion , the fin ##ca vi ##gia was ex ##pro ##pr ##iated by the cuban government , complete with hemingway ' s collection of " four to six thousand books " . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway continued to re ##work the material that was published as " a move ##able feast " through the 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] in mid - 1959 , he visited spain to research a series of bull ##fighting articles commissioned by " life " magazine . [SEP]
[CLS] he was unable to organize his writing for the first time in his life , so he asked a . e . hot ##chner to travel to cuba to help him . [SEP]
[CLS] he set up a small office in his new york city apartment and attempted to work , but he left new york for good soon after . [SEP]
[CLS] he then traveled alone to spain to be photographed for the front cover of " life " magazine . [SEP]
[CLS] a few days later , the news reported that he was seriously ill and on the verge of dying , which panicked mary until she received a cable from him telling her , " reports false . [SEP]
[CLS] he was lonely and took to his bed for days , retreating into silence , despite having the first installment ##s of " the dangerous summer " published in " life " in september 1960 to good reviews . [SEP]
[CLS] in october , he left spain for new york , where he refused to leave mary ' s apartment on the pre ##text that he was being watched . [SEP]
[CLS] he worried about his taxes and that he would never return to cuba to retrieve the manuscripts that he had left in a bank vault . [SEP]
[CLS] the fbi had , in fact , opened a file on him during world war ii , when he used the " pi ##lar " to patrol the waters off cuba , and j . edgar hoover had an agent in havana watch him during the 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of november , mary was at her wits ' end , and sa ##vier ##s suggested that hemingway go to the mayo clinic in minnesota ; hemingway might have believed that he was to be treated there for hyper ##tension . [SEP]
[CLS] the fbi knew that hemingway was at the mayo clinic , as an agent later documented in a letter written in january 1961 . [SEP]
[CLS] meyer ##s writes that " an aura of secrecy surrounds hemingway ' s treatment at the mayo " but confirms that he was treated with electro ##con ##vu ##ls ##ive therapy as many as 15 times in december 1960 and was " released in ruins " in january 1961 . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway was back in ke ##tch ##um in april 1961 , three months after being released from the mayo clinic , when mary " found hemingway holding a shotgun " in the kitchen one morning . [SEP]
[CLS] she called sa ##vier ##s , who se ##date ##d him and admitted him to the sun valley hospital ; from there he was returned to the mayo for more electro ##sho ##ck treatments . [SEP]
[CLS] he was released in late june and arrived home in ke ##tch ##um on june 30 , and he " quite deliberately " shot himself with his favorite shotgun in the early morning hours of july 2 , 1961 . [SEP]
[CLS] he had unlocked the basement store ##room where his guns were kept , gone upstairs to the front entrance foyer , and shot himself with the " double - barrel ##ed shotgun that he had used so often it might have been a friend " . [SEP]
[CLS] mary called the sun valley hospital , and a doctor quickly arrived at the house who determined that hemingway " had died of a self - inflicted wound to the head " . [SEP]
[CLS] mary was se ##date ##d and taken to the hospital , returning home the next day where she cleaned the house and saw to the funeral and travel arrangements . [SEP]
[CLS] bern ##ice ke ##rt writes that it " did not seem to her a conscious lie " when she told the press that his death had been accidental . [SEP]
[CLS] an altar boy faint ##ed at the head of the casket during the funeral , and hemingway ' s brother leicester wrote : " it seemed to me ernest would have approved of it all . " [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway ' s behavior during his final years had been similar to that of his father before he killed himself ; his father may have had the genetic disease hem ##och ##rom ##ato ##sis , whereby the inability to meta ##bol ##ize iron cu ##lm ##inates in mental and physical deterioration . [SEP]
[CLS] " the sun also rises " is written in the spare , tight prose that made hemingway famous , and , according to james na ##gel , " changed the nature of american writing . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1954 , when hemingway was awarded the nobel prize for literature , it was for " his mastery of the art of narrative , most recently demonstrated in " the old man and the sea " , and for the influence that he has ex ##erted on contemporary style . " [SEP]
[CLS] henry louis gates believes hemingway ' s style was fundamentally shaped " in reaction to his experience of world war " . [SEP]
[CLS] after world war i , he and other modernist ##s " lost faith in the central institutions of western civilization " by reacting against the elaborate style of 19th - century writers and by creating a style " in which meaning is established through dialogue , through action , and silence ##s — a fiction in which nothing crucial — or at least very little — is stated explicitly . " [SEP]
[CLS] because he began as a writer of short stories , baker believes hemingway learned to " get the most from the least , how to pr ##une language , how to multi ##ply int ##ens ##ities and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth . " [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway called his style the ice ##berg theory : the facts float above water ; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight . [SEP]
[CLS] hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing ( such as nick adams fishing in " the big two - hearted river " ) though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface ( nick adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about anything else ) . [SEP]
[CLS] paul smith writes that hemingway ' s first stories , collected as " in our time " , showed he was still experimenting with his writing style . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , benson post ##ulates that hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with " what if " scenarios : " what if i were wounded in such a way that i could not sleep at night ? [SEP]
