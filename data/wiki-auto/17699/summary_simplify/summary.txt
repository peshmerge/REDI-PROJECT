It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or a proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true.
This represents a type of false dichotomy in that it excludes the possibility that there may have been an insufficient investigation to prove that the proposition is either true or false.
It also does not allow for the possibility that the answer is unknowable, only knowable in the future, or neither completely true nor completely false.
In debates, appeals to ignorance are sometimes used in an attempt to shift the burden of proof.
In research, low-power experiments are subject to false negatives (there would have been an observable effect if there had been a larger sample size or better experimental design) and false positives (there was an observable effect; however, this was a coincidence due purely to random chance, or the events correlate, but there is no cause-effect relationship).
Contraposition is a logically valid rule of inference that allows the creation of a new proposition from the negation and reordering of an existing one.
The method applies to any proposition of the type "If A then B" and says that negating all the variables and switching them back to front leads to a new proposition i.e.
"If Not-B then Not-A" that is just as true as the original one and that the first implies the second and the second implies the first.
Transposition is exactly the same thing as Contraposition, described in a different language.
In practice these arguments are often false and rely on the truth of the supporting premise.
