[CLS] argument from ignorance ( from ) , also known as appeal to ignorance ( in which " ignorance " represents " a lack of contrary evidence " ) , is a fall ##acy in informal logic . [SEP]
[CLS] it asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or a proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true . [SEP]
[CLS] this represents a type of false di ##cho ##tom ##y in that it exclude ##s the possibility that there may have been an insufficient investigation to prove that the proposition is either true or false . [SEP]
[CLS] it also does not allow for the possibility that the answer is un ##k ##now ##able , only know ##able in the future , or neither completely true nor completely false . [SEP]
[CLS] in debates , appeals to ignorance are sometimes used in an attempt to shift the burden of proof . [SEP]
[CLS] in research , low - power experiments are subject to false negative ##s ( there would have been an ob ##ser ##vable effect if there had been a larger sample size or better experimental design ) and false positive ##s ( there was an ob ##ser ##vable effect ; however , this was a coincidence due purely to random chance , or the events co ##rre ##late , but there is no cause - effect relationship ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the term was likely coined by philosopher john locke in the late 17th century . [SEP]
[CLS] these examples contain or represent missing information . [SEP]
[CLS] these examples have the potential for " false negative " results . [SEP]
[CLS] these examples contain definite evidence that can be used to show , indicate , suggest , in ##fer or de ##du ##ce the non - existence or non - presence of something . [SEP]
[CLS] contra ##position is a logical ##ly valid rule of inference that allows the creation of a new proposition from the ne ##gation and re ##ord ##ering of an existing one . [SEP]
[CLS] the method applies to any proposition of the type " if a then b " and says that ne ##gating all the variables and switching them back to front leads to a new proposition i . e . " if not - b then not - a " that is just as true as the original one and that the first implies the second and the second implies the first . [SEP]
[CLS] trans ##position is exactly the same thing as contra ##position , described in a different language . [SEP]
[CLS] " null result " is a term often used in science to indicate " evidence of absence " . [SEP]
[CLS] a search for water on the ground may yield a null result ( the ground is dry ) ; therefore , it probably did not rain . [SEP]
[CLS] in practice these arguments are often false and rely on the truth of the supporting premise . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the argument that " if i had just sat on a wild por ##cup ##ine then i would know it " is probably not a fall ##acy and depends entirely on the truth of the leading proposition ( the ability to know it ) . [SEP]
