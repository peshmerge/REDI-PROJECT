argument from ignorance aboard is a fallacy in informal logic .
it says that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or that it has not yet been proven true .
this also means that the possibility is not true or false .
it also says that the answer can not be true , but not completely , or that it will be true .
appeals to ignorance are often used to try to prove the proof .
in research , low-power experiments are subject to false negatives .
the term was coined by john locke in the late 17th century .
these examples contain or represent missing information .
these examples can be written as " false negative " results .
these examples contain definite evidence that can be used to show , suggest , infer or deduce the non-existence or non-existence of something .
contraposition is a logically valid rule of inference .
the first step is that the second implies the second and the second implies the first .
transposition is the same thing as contraposition .
null result is a term often used in science to indicate " evidence of absence " .
a search for water on the ground may yield a null result whenever the ground is dry henan ; therefore , it probably did not rain .
in practice these arguments are often false .
for example , the argument that " if i had just sat on a wild porcupine then i would know it " is probably not a fallacy and depends entirely on the truth of the leading proposition .
