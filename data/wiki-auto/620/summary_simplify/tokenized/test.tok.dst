[CLS] the book tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer , hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal , free , and happy . [SEP]
[CLS] ultimately , however , the rebellion is betrayed and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before , under the dictatorship of a pig named napoleon . [SEP]
[CLS] according to or ##well , the fable reflects events leading up to the russian revolution of 1917 and then on into the stalin ##ist era of the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet union , he believed , had become a brutal dictatorship , built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror . [SEP]
[CLS] the original title was " animal farm : a fairy story , " but u . s . publishers dropped the sub ##ti ##tle when it was published in 1946 , and only one of the translations during or ##well ' s lifetime kept it . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##well wrote the book between november 1943 and february 1944 , when the uk was in its wartime alliance with the soviet union against nazi germany and the british people and intelligent ##sia held stalin in high esteem , a phenomenon or ##well hated . [SEP]
[CLS] it won a retrospective hugo award in 1996 and is included in the great books of the western world selection . [SEP]
[CLS] the poorly - run manor farm near willing ##don , england , is ripe ##ned for rebellion from its animal populace by neglect at the hands of the ir ##res ##pon ##sible and alcoholic farmer mr . jones . [SEP]
[CLS] one night , the ex ##al ##ted boar old major organizes a meeting , at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called " beasts of england " . [SEP]
[CLS] they adopt the seven command ##ments of animal ##ism , the most important of which is , " all animals are equal " . [SEP]
[CLS] following an unsuccessful attempt by mr . jones and his associates to re ##take the farm ( later dubbed the " battle of the cows ##hed " ) , snow ##ball announces his plans to modern ##ize the farm by building a windmill . [SEP]
[CLS] napoleon en ##act ##s changes to the governance structure of the farm , replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm . [SEP]
[CLS] through a young pig named sq ##ue ##ale ##r , napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea . [SEP]
[CLS] when the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm , napoleon and sq ##ue ##ale ##r convince the animals that snow ##ball is trying to sabotage their project , and begin to purge the farm of animals napoleon accuse ##s of consort ##ing with his old rival . [SEP]
[CLS] when some animals recall the battle of the cows ##hed , napoleon ( who was nowhere to be found during the battle ) frequently sm ##ears snow ##ball as a collaborator of mr . jones , while falsely representing himself as the hero of the battle . [SEP]
[CLS] although the animals win the battle , they do so at great cost , as many , including boxer the work ##horse , are wounded . [SEP]
[CLS] although boxer is clearly taken away in a kn ##acker ' s van , sq ##ue ##ale ##r quickly assure ##s the animals that the van had been purchased from the kn ##acker by an animal hospital and that the previous owner ' s sign ##board had not been rep ##aint ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the truth is that napoleon had engineered the sale of boxer to the kn ##acker , allowing napoleon and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] years pass , the windmill is rebuilt , and another windmill is constructed , which makes the farm a good amount of income . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to boxer , many of the animals who participated in the rebellion are dead or old . [SEP]
[CLS] the seven command ##ments are ab ##ridge ##d to just two phrases : " " all animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others . " " [SEP]
[CLS] napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers , with whom he celebrates a new alliance . [SEP]
[CLS] both napoleon and mr . pi ##lk ##ington , one of the farmers , play the ace of spade ##s at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first . [SEP]
[CLS] george or ##well wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 after his experiences during the spanish civil war , which he described in " homage to catalonia " ( 1938 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the preface of a 1947 ukrainian edition of " animal farm " , he explained how escaping the communist purge ##s in spain taught him " how easily total ##itarian propaganda can control the opinion of en ##light ##ened people in democratic countries " . [SEP]
[CLS] this motivated or ##well to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the stalin ##ist corruption of the original socialist ideals . [SEP]
[CLS] " homage at catalonia " sold poorly ; after seeing arthur ko ##est ##ler ' s best - selling " darkness at noon " about the same war , or ##well decided that fiction was the best way to describe total ##itarian ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] the booklet included instructions on how to que ##ll ideological fears of the soviet union , such as directions to claim that the red terror was a fig ##ment of nazi imagination . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##well initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published , largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between britain , the united states , and the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] four publishers refused ; one had initially accepted the work but declined it after consulting the ministry of information . [SEP]
[CLS] he also submitted the manuscript to faber and faber , where the poet t . s . eliot ( who was a director of the firm ) rejected it ; eliot wrote back to or ##well praising the book ' s " good writing " and " fundamental integrity " , but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint " which i take to be generally tr ##ots ##ky ##ite " . [SEP]
[CLS] eliot said he found the view " not convincing " , and contend ##ed that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm ; he po ##sit ##ed that someone might argue " what was needed . . . was not more communism but more public - spirited pigs " . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##well let andre de ##uts ##ch , who was working for nicholson & watson in 1944 , read the types ##cript , and de ##uts ##ch was convinced that nicholson & watson would want to publish it ; however , they did not , and " lectured or ##well on what they perceived to be errors in " animal farm " . " [SEP]
[CLS] the publisher jonathan cape , who had initially accepted " animal farm " , subsequently rejected the book after an official at the british ministry of information warned him off — although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a soviet spy . [SEP]
[CLS] writing to leonard moore , a partner in the literary agency of christy & moore , publisher jonathan cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the ministry of information . [SEP]
[CLS] it may reasonably be assumed that the ' important official ' was a man named peter sm ##oll ##ett , who was later un ##mas ##ked as a soviet agent . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##well was suspicious of sm ##oll ##ett / sm ##ol ##ka , and he would be one of the names or ##well included in his list of crypt ##o - communists and fellow - travellers sent to the information research department in 1949 . [SEP]
[CLS] frederic war ##burg also faced pressures against publication , even from people in his own office and from his wife pamela , who felt that it was not the moment for ing ##rat ##itude towards stalin and the heroic red army , which had played a major part in defeating adolf hitler . [SEP]
[CLS] in october 1945 , or ##well wrote to frederic war ##burg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist david low might illustrate " animal farm " . [SEP]
[CLS] low had written a letter saying that he had had " a good time with " animal farm " — an excellent bit of satire — it would illustrate perfectly . " [SEP]
[CLS] nothing came of this , and a trial issue produced by sec ##ker & war ##burg in 1956 illustrated by john driver was abandoned , but the f ##olio society published an edition in 1984 illustrated by quentin blake and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist ralph ste ##ad ##man was published by sec ##ker & war ##burg in 1995 to celebrate the fi ##ft ##ie ##th anniversary of the first edition of " animal farm " . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##well originally wrote a preface complaining about british self - censorship and how the british people were suppress ##ing criticism of the ussr , their world war ii ally : although the first edition allowed space for the preface , it was not included , and as of june 2009 most editions of the book have not included it . [SEP]
[CLS] for reasons unknown , no preface was supplied , and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1972 , ian angus found the original types ##cript titled " the freedom of the press " , and bernard cr ##ick published it , together with his own introduction , in " the times literary supplement " on 15 september 1972 as " how the essay came to be written " . [SEP]
[CLS] the same essay also appeared in the italian 1976 edition of " animal farm " with another introduction by cr ##ick , claiming to be the first edition with the preface . [SEP]
[CLS] the all ##ego ##ry turned out to be a cr ##eak ##ing machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly . " [SEP]
[CLS] soul ##e believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real - world inspiration ##s , and said , " it seems to me that the failure of this book ( commercially it is already assured of tremendous success ) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced , but rather with stereo ##type ##d ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well " . [SEP]
[CLS] to ##sco f ##y ##vel , writing in " tribune " on the same day , called the book " a gentle satire on a certain state and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us . " [SEP]
[CLS] julian sy ##mons responded , on 7 september , " should we not expect , in " tribune " at least , acknowledge ##ment of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular state — soviet russia ? [SEP]
[CLS] it seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify napoleon with stalin , and snow ##ball with tr ##ots ##ky , and express an opinion favourable or un ##fa ##vo ##urable to the author , upon a political ground . [SEP]
[CLS] the cia from 1952 to 1957 in operation ae ##din ##osa ##ur sent millions of balloons carrying copies of the novel into poland , hungary , and czechoslovakia , whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down . [SEP]
[CLS] the pigs snow ##ball , napoleon , and sq ##ue ##ale ##r adapt old major ' s ideas into " a complete system of thought " , which they formally name animal ##ism , an all ##ego ##ric reference to communism , not to be confused with the philosophy animal ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] soon after , napoleon and sq ##ue ##ale ##r part ##ake in activities associated with the humans ( drinking alcohol , sleeping in beds , trading ) , which were explicitly prohibited by the seven command ##ments . [SEP]
[CLS] sq ##ue ##ale ##r is employed to alter the seven command ##ments to account for this human ##isation , an all ##usion to the soviet government ' s rev ##ising of history in order to exercise control of the people ' s beliefs about themselves and their society . [SEP]
[CLS] which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm , often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of animal ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] this is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the seven command ##ments , which were supposed to keep order within animal farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans ' evil habits . [SEP]
[CLS] through the revision of the command ##ments , or ##well demonstrates how simply political dog ##ma can be turned into mall ##ea ##ble propaganda . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##well himself wrote in 1946 , " of course i intended it primarily as a satire on the russian revolution . . . and " that kind " of revolution ( violent con ##sp ##ira ##tori ##al revolution , led by unconscious ##ly power - hungry people ) can only lead to a change of masters - revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert . " [SEP]
[CLS] on my return from spain in 1937 i thought of exposing the soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages . " [SEP]
[CLS] the " battle of the cows ##hed " has been said to represent the allied invasion of soviet russia in 1918 , and the defeat of the white russians in the russian civil war . [SEP]
[CLS] the pigs ' app ##ropriation of milk and apples for their own use , " the turning point of the story " as or ##well termed it in a letter to dwight macdonald , stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left - wing 1921 k ##rons ##tadt revolt against the bolsheviks , and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various five year plans . [SEP]
[CLS] the pup ##pies controlled by napoleon parallel the nur ##ture of the secret police in the stalin ##ist structure , and the pigs ' treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s . [SEP]
[CLS] in chapter seven , when the animals confess their none ##xi ##sten ##t crimes and are killed , or ##well directly all ##udes to the purge ##s , confessions and show trials of the late 1930s . [SEP]
[CLS] peter edge ##rly fir ##cho ##w and peter davis ##on consider that the " battle of the windmill " represents world war ii , especially the battle of stalin ##grad and the battle of moscow . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##well had the publisher alter this to " all the animals except napoleon " in recognition of stalin ' s decision to remain in moscow during the german advance . [SEP]
[CLS] c ##za ##ps ##ki , a survivor of the katy ##n massacre and an opponent of the soviet regime , told or ##well , as or ##well wrote to arthur ko ##est ##ler , that it had been " the character and great ##ness of stalin " that saved russia from the german invasion . [SEP]
[CLS] other connections that writers have suggested illustrate or ##well ' s tel ##es ##co ##ping of russian history from 1917 to 1943 include the wave of rebellious ##ness that ran through the countryside after the rebellion , which stands for the ab ##ort ##ive revolutions in hungary and in germany ( ch iv ) ; the conflict between napoleon and snow ##ball ( ch v ) , parallel ##ing " the two rival and quasi - mess ##iani ##c beliefs that seemed pitted against one another : tr ##ots ##ky ##ism , with its faith in the revolutionary vo ##cation of the pro ##let ##aria ##t of the west ; and stalin ##ism with its g ##lor ##ification of russia ' s socialist destiny " ; napoleon ' s dealings with why ##mp ##er and the willing ##don markets ( ch vi ) , parallel ##ing the treaty of rap ##all ##o ; and frederick ' s forged bank notes , parallel ##ing the hitler - stalin pact of august 1939 , after which frederick attacks animal farm without warning and destroys the windmill . [SEP]
[CLS] the book ' s close , with the pigs and men in a kind of rap ##pro ##che ##ment , reflected or ##well ' s view of the 1943 te ##her ##an conference that seemed to display the establishment of " the best possible relations between the ussr and the west " — but in reality were destined , as or ##well pre ##sc ##ient ##ly predicted , to continue to un ##rave ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] the disagreement between the allies and the start of the cold war is suggested when napoleon and pi ##lk ##ington , both suspicious , " played an ace of spade ##s simultaneously " . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , the music in the novel , starting with " beasts of england " and the later anthem ##s , parallels " the internationale " and its adoption and rep ##udi ##ation by the soviet authorities as to the anthem of the ussr in the 1920s and 1930s . [SEP]
[CLS] a theatrical version , with music by richard peas ##lee and lyrics by adrian mitchell , was staged at the national theatre london on 25 april 1984 , directed by peter hall . [SEP]
