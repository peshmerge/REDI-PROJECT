the book tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their farmer .
the farm ends up as bad as it was before , under the dictatorship of a pig named napoleon .
the fable was about the events leading up to the russian revolution of 1917 and then on into the stalinist era of the soviet union .
the soviet union , he believed , had become a brutal dictatorship , built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror .
the original title was " animal farm : a fairy story , " but u . s . publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946 .
he wrote the book between november 1943 and february 1944 .
it won a hugo award in 1996 .

the most important of these is , " all animals are equal " .

both napoleon and mr . pilkington , one of the farmers , play the ace of spades at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first .
george orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 after his experiences during the spanish civil war .
in the preface of a 1947 ukrainian edition of " animal farm " , he explained how escaping the communist purges in spain taught him " how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries " .
this motivated orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals .
after seeing arthur koestler 's best-selling " darkness at noon " about the same war , orwell decided that fiction was the best way to describe totalitarianism .
the booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the soviet union , such as directions to say that the red terror was a figment of nazi imagination .
at first , orwell encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published .
four publishers refused ; one had originally accepted the work , but declined it after consulting the ministry of information .
eliot wrote back to orwell praising the book 's " good writing " and " fundamental integrity " , but said that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for trotskyite " .
eliot said he found the view " not convincing " .
orwell let andre deutsch , who was working for nicholson & watson in 1944 , read the typescript .
the publisher jonathan cape , who had initially accepted " animal farm " , subsequently rejected the book after an official at the british ministry of information warned him off .
he wrote to leonard moore , a partner in the literary agency of christy & moore , who published the decision .
it may reasonably be assumed that the ' important official ' was a man named peter smollett , who was later unmasked as a soviet agent .
orwell was suspicious of smollett / smolka , and he would be included in his list of crypto-communists and fellow travellers sent to the information research department in 1949 .
frederic warburg also faced pressures against publication , even from people in his own office and from his wife pamela , who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards stalin and the heroic red army , which had played a major part in defeating adolf hitler .
in october 1945 , orwell wrote to frederic warburg .
low had written a letter saying that he had " a good time with " animal farm " — an excellent bit of satire — it would illustrate perfectly . "
nothing came of this , and a trial issue produced by secker & warburg in 1956 illustrated by john driver was abandoned , but the folio society published an edition illustrated by quentin blake and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist ralph steadman was illustrated by the cartoonist ralph steadman .
orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about british self-censorship and how the british people were suppressing criticism of the ussr , their world war ii ally : although the first edition allowed space for the preface , it was not included , and as of june 2009 most editions of the book have not included it .
no preface was supplied , and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute .
in 1972 , angus found the first typescript titled " the freedom of the press " .
the same essay also appeared in the italian 1976 edition of " animal farm " with another introduction by crick .
the allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly . "
soule believed that the animals were not consistent with their real-world inspirations , and said , " it seems to me that the failure of this book commercially it is already assured of tremendous successocation arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced , but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well " .
tosco fyvel , writing in " tribune " on the same day , called the book " a gentle satire on a certain state and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us . "
julian symons responded , on 7 september , " tribune " at least , acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular state — soviet russia ?
it seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify napoleon with stalin , and snowball with trotsky .
the cia from 1952 to 1957 in operation aedinosaur sent millions of balloons carrying copies of the novel into poland , hungary , and czechoslovakia , whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down .
the pigs snowball , napoleon , and squealer adapt old major 's ideas into " a complete system of thought " .
napoleon and squealer did activities associated with the humans ashore drinking alcohol , sleeping in beds , trading posts , which were prohibited by the seven commandments .
this is a list of the leaders of the soviet government to use their beliefs about themselves and their society .
it is mainly used by the sheep on the farm .
this is a ironic twist to the original purpose of the seven commandments , which were supposed to keep order within animal farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from being following the humans ' evil habits .
through the revision of the commandments , orwell demonstrates how political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda .
in 1946 , " of course i intended it primarily as a satire on the russian revolution . . . and " that kind " of revolution .
on my return from spain in 1937 i thought of exposing the soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages .
the battle of the cowshed was a battle that was fought in 1918 for the allied invasion of soviet russia and the defeat of the white russians in the russian civil war .
the pigs ' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use , " the turning point of the story " as orwell termed it in a letter to dwight macdonald , stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left-wing 1921 kronstadt revolt against the bolsheviks , and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill .
the puppies controlled by napoleon parallel the secret police in the stalinist structure .
orwell tells the purges , confessions and show trials of the late 1930s .
peter edgerly firchow and peter davison consider that the " battle of the windmill " represents world war ii , especially the battle of stalingrad and the battle of moscow .
this was because of stalin 's decision to remain in moscow during the german advance .
czapski , a survivor of the katyn massacre and an opponent of the soviet regime , told orwell , that it had been " the character and greatness of stalin " that saved russia from the german invasion .
other connections that writers have suggested that writers have illustrated the history of russia from 1917 to 1943 include the rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the rebellion .
the book 's close , with the pigs and men in a kind of fighting , showed orwell 's view of the 1943 teheran conference that seemed to show the establishment of " the best possible relations between the ussr and the west " .
the disagreement between the allies and the start of the cold war is suggested when napoleon and pilkington , both suspicious , " played an ace of spades simultaneously " .
the music in the novel starts with " beasts of england " and the later anthems .
a theatrical version was staged at the national theatre london on 25 april 1984 .
