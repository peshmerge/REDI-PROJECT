[CLS] most significant languages in the modern era are written down , and for most such languages a standard or ##th ##ography has been developed , often based on a standard variety of the language , and thus exhibiting less dialect variation than the spoken language . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes there may be variation in a language ' s or ##th ##ography , as between american and british spelling in the case of english or ##th ##ography . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##th ##ography is largely concerned with matters of spelling , and in particular the relationship between phone ##mes and graph ##eme ##s in a language . [SEP]
[CLS] other elements that may be considered part of or ##th ##ography include h ##yp ##hen ##ation , capital ##ization , word breaks , emphasis , and pun ##ct ##uation . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##th ##ography thus describes or defines the set of symbols used in writing a language , and the rules regarding how to use those symbols . [SEP]
[CLS] the rules for doing this tend to become standardized for a given language , leading to the development of an or ##th ##ography that is generally considered " correct " . [SEP]
[CLS] the original sense of the word , though , implies a di ##cho ##tom ##y of correct and incorrect , and the word is still most often used to refer specifically to a thoroughly standardized , pre ##script ##ively correct , way of writing a language . [SEP]
[CLS] these are a type of abstraction , analogous to the phone ##mes of spoken languages ; different physical forms of written symbols are considered to represent the same graph ##eme if the differences between them are not significant for meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , different forms of the letter " b " are all considered to represent a single graph ##eme in the or ##th ##ography of , say , english . [SEP]
[CLS] the writing systems on which or ##th ##og ##raph ##ies are based can be divided into a number of types , depending on what type of unit each symbol serves to represent . [SEP]
[CLS] many writing systems combine features of more than one of these types , and a number of detailed classifications have been proposed . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##th ##og ##raph ##ies that use alphabet ##s and sy ##lla ##bari ##es are based on the principle that the written symbols ( graph ##eme ##s ) correspond to units of sound of the spoken language : phone ##mes in the former case , and syllables in the latter . [SEP]
[CLS] english or ##th ##ography , french or ##th ##ography and danish or ##th ##ography , for example , are highly irregular , whereas the or ##th ##og ##raph ##ies of languages such as russian , german and spanish represent pronunciation much more faithful ##ly , although the correspondence between letters and phone ##mes is still not exact . [SEP]
[CLS] an or ##th ##ography in which the correspondence ##s between spelling and pronunciation are highly complex or inconsistent is called a " deep or ##th ##ography " ( or less formally , the language is said to have " irregular spelling " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the main reasons for which spelling and pronunciation devi ##ate is that sound changes taking place in the spoken language are not always reflected in the or ##th ##ography , and hence spelling ##s correspond to historical rather than present - day pronunciation . [SEP]
[CLS] one consequence of this is that many spelling ##s come to reflect a word ' s mor ##ph ##ophone ##mic structure rather than its purely phone ##mic structure ( for example , the english regular past tense mor ##ph ##eme is consistently spelled " - ed " in spite of its different pronunciation ##s in various words ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the sy ##lla ##bar ##y systems of japanese ( hi ##ragan ##a and kata ##kan ##a ) are examples of almost perfectly shallow or ##th ##og ##raph ##ies — the kan ##a correspond with almost perfect consistency to the spoken syllables , although with a few exceptions where symbols reflect historical or mor ##ph ##ophone ##mic features : notably the use of ち " ji " and つ " zu " ( rather than し " ji " and す " zu " , their pronunciation in standard tokyo dialect ) when the character is a vo ##icing of an underlying ち or つ ( see ren ##dak ##u ) , and the use of は , を , and へ to represent the sounds [UNK] , お , and え , as relics of historical kan ##a usage . [SEP]
[CLS] the korean " hangul " system was also originally an extremely shallow or ##th ##ography , but as a representation of the modern language it frequently also reflects mor ##ph ##ophone ##mic features . [SEP]
[CLS] for full discussion of degrees of correspondence between spelling and pronunciation in alphabet ##ic or ##th ##og ##raph ##ies , including reasons why such correspondence may break down , see phone ##mic or ##th ##ography . [SEP]
[CLS] an or ##th ##ography based on the principle that symbols correspond to phone ##mes may , in some cases , lack characters to represent all the phone ##mes or all the phone ##mic distinctions in the language . [SEP]
[CLS] a more systematic example is that of ab ##jad ##s like the arabic and hebrew alphabet ##s , in which the short vowels are normally left un ##written and must be in ##fer ##red by the reader . [SEP]
[CLS] when an alphabet is borrowed from its original language for use with a new language — as has been done with the latin alphabet for many languages , or japanese kata ##kan ##a for non - japanese words — it often proves defective in representing the new language ' s phone ##mes . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes this problem is addressed by the use of such devices as dig ##raph ##s ( such as " sh " and " ch " in english , where pairs of letters represent single sounds ) , dia ##cr ##itic ##s ( like the car ##on on the letters " s " and " c " , which represent those same sounds in czech ) , or the addition of completely new symbols ( as some languages have introduced the letter " w " to the latin alphabet ) or of symbols from another alphabet , such as the rune " þ " in icelandic . [SEP]
[CLS] after the classical period , greek developed a lower ##case letter system that introduced dia ##cr ##itic marks to enable foreigners to learn pronunciation and in some cases , grammatical features . [SEP]
[CLS] in modern greek types ##etti ##ng , this system has been simplified to only have a single accent to indicate which syllable is stressed . [SEP]
