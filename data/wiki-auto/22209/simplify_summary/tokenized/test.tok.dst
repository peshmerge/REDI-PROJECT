[CLS] an or ##th ##ography is a set of conventions for writing a language . [SEP]
[CLS] it includes norms of spelling , h ##yp ##hen ##ation , capital ##ization , word breaks , emphasis , and pun ##ct ##uation . [SEP]
[CLS] most significant languages in the modern era are written down , and for most such languages a standard or ##th ##ography has been developed , often based on a standard variety of the language , and thus exhibiting less dialect variation than the spoken language . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes there may be variation in a language ' s or ##th ##ography , as between american and british spelling in the case of english or ##th ##ography . [SEP]
[CLS] in some languages or ##th ##ography is regulated by language academies , although for many languages ( including english ) there are no such authorities , and or ##th ##ography develops in a more natural way . [SEP]
[CLS] even in the latter languages , a significant amount of consensus arises naturally , although a maximum of consistency or standardization occurs only when pre ##script ##ively imposed according to style guides . [SEP]
[CLS] the english word " or ##th ##ography " dates from the 15th century . [SEP]
[CLS] it comes from the french " or ##th ##og ##raph ##ie " , from latin " or ##th ##og ##raph ##ia " , which derives from greek ο ##ρ ##θ ##ος " or ##th ##os " , " correct " , and γ ##ρ ##α ##φ ##ε ##ι ##ν " graph ##ein " , " to write " . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##th ##ography is largely concerned with matters of spelling , and in particular the relationship between phone ##mes and graph ##eme ##s in a language . [SEP]
[CLS] other elements that may be considered part of or ##th ##ography include h ##yp ##hen ##ation , capital ##ization , word breaks , emphasis , and pun ##ct ##uation . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##th ##ography thus describes or defines the set of symbols used in writing a language , and the rules regarding how to use those symbols . [SEP]
[CLS] most natural languages developed as oral languages , and writing systems have usually been crafted or adapted as ways of representing the spoken language . [SEP]
[CLS] the rules for doing this tend to become standardized for a given language , leading to the development of an or ##th ##ography that is generally considered " correct " . [SEP]
[CLS] in linguistics the term " or ##th ##ography " is often used to refer to any method of writing a language , without judgment as to right and wrong , with a scientific understanding that or ##th ##ographic standardization exists on a spectrum of strength of convention . [SEP]
[CLS] the original sense of the word , though , implies a di ##cho ##tom ##y of correct and incorrect , and the word is still most often used to refer specifically to a thoroughly standardized , pre ##script ##ively correct , way of writing a language . [SEP]
[CLS] a distinction may be made here between " et ##ic " and " emi ##c " viewpoint ##s : the purely descriptive ( et ##ic ) approach , which simply considers any system that is actually used — and the emi ##c view , which takes account of language users ' perceptions of correct ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##th ##ographic units , such as letters of an alphabet , are technically called graph ##eme ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] these are a type of abstraction , analogous to the phone ##mes of spoken languages ; different physical forms of written symbols are considered to represent the same graph ##eme if the differences between them are not significant for meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , different forms of the letter " b " are all considered to represent a single graph ##eme in the or ##th ##ography of , say , english . [SEP]
[CLS] graph ##eme ##s or sequences of them are sometimes placed between angle brackets , as in or . [SEP]
[CLS] this distinguishes them from phone ##mic transcription , which is placed between slash ##es ( / b / , / b ##æ ##k / ) , and from phonetic transcription , which is placed between square brackets ( b , b ##æ ##k ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the writing systems on which or ##th ##og ##raph ##ies are based can be divided into a number of types , depending on what type of unit each symbol serves to represent . [SEP]
[CLS] the principal types are " logo ##graphic " ( with symbols representing words or mor ##ph ##eme ##s ) , " sy ##lla ##bic " ( with symbols representing syllables ) , and " alphabet ##ic " ( with symbols roughly representing phone ##mes ) . [SEP]
[CLS] many writing systems combine features of more than one of these types , and a number of detailed classifications have been proposed . [SEP]
[CLS] japanese is an example of a language that can be written in all three : logo ##graphic kan ##ji , sy ##lla ##bic hi ##ragan ##a and kata ##kan ##a , and alphabet ##ic roma ##ji . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##th ##og ##raph ##ies that use alphabet ##s and sy ##lla ##bari ##es are based on the principle that the written symbols ( graph ##eme ##s ) correspond to units of sound of the spoken language : phone ##mes in the former case , and syllables in the latter . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in virtually all cases , this correspondence is not exact . [SEP]
[CLS] different languages ' or ##th ##og ##raph ##ies offer different degrees of correspondence between spelling and pronunciation . [SEP]
[CLS] english or ##th ##ography , french or ##th ##ography and danish or ##th ##ography , for example , are highly irregular , whereas the or ##th ##og ##raph ##ies of languages such as russian , german and spanish represent pronunciation much more faithful ##ly , although the correspondence between letters and phone ##mes is still not exact . [SEP]
[CLS] finnish , turkish and serb ##o - croatian or ##th ##og ##raph ##ies are remarkably consistent : approximation of the principle " one letter per sound " . [SEP]
[CLS] an or ##th ##ography in which the correspondence ##s between spelling and pronunciation are highly complex or inconsistent is called a " deep or ##th ##ography " ( or less formally , the language is said to have " irregular spelling " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] an or ##th ##ography with relatively simple and consistent correspondence ##s is called " shallow " ( and the language has " regular spelling " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the main reasons for which spelling and pronunciation devi ##ate is that sound changes taking place in the spoken language are not always reflected in the or ##th ##ography , and hence spelling ##s correspond to historical rather than present - day pronunciation . [SEP]
[CLS] one consequence of this is that many spelling ##s come to reflect a word ' s mor ##ph ##ophone ##mic structure rather than its purely phone ##mic structure ( for example , the english regular past tense mor ##ph ##eme is consistently spelled " - ed " in spite of its different pronunciation ##s in various words ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this is discussed further at . [SEP]
[CLS] the sy ##lla ##bar ##y systems of japanese ( hi ##ragan ##a and kata ##kan ##a ) are examples of almost perfectly shallow or ##th ##og ##raph ##ies — the kan ##a correspond with almost perfect consistency to the spoken syllables , although with a few exceptions where symbols reflect historical or mor ##ph ##ophone ##mic features : notably the use of ち " ji " and つ " zu " ( rather than し " ji " and す " zu " , their pronunciation in standard tokyo dialect ) when the character is a vo ##icing of an underlying ち or つ ( see ren ##dak ##u ) , and the use of は , を , and へ to represent the sounds [UNK] , お , and え , as relics of historical kan ##a usage . [SEP]
[CLS] the korean " hangul " system was also originally an extremely shallow or ##th ##ography , but as a representation of the modern language it frequently also reflects mor ##ph ##ophone ##mic features . [SEP]
[CLS] for full discussion of degrees of correspondence between spelling and pronunciation in alphabet ##ic or ##th ##og ##raph ##ies , including reasons why such correspondence may break down , see phone ##mic or ##th ##ography . [SEP]
[CLS] an or ##th ##ography based on the principle that symbols correspond to phone ##mes may , in some cases , lack characters to represent all the phone ##mes or all the phone ##mic distinctions in the language . [SEP]
[CLS] this is called a defective or ##th ##ography . [SEP]
[CLS] an example in english is the lack of any indication of stress . [SEP]
[CLS] another is the dig ##raph " th " , which represents two different phone ##mes ( as in " then " and " thin " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a more systematic example is that of ab ##jad ##s like the arabic and hebrew alphabet ##s , in which the short vowels are normally left un ##written and must be in ##fer ##red by the reader . [SEP]
[CLS] when an alphabet is borrowed from its original language for use with a new language — as has been done with the latin alphabet for many languages , or japanese kata ##kan ##a for non - japanese words — it often proves defective in representing the new language ' s phone ##mes . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes this problem is addressed by the use of such devices as dig ##raph ##s ( such as " sh " and " ch " in english , where pairs of letters represent single sounds ) , dia ##cr ##itic ##s ( like the car ##on on the letters " s " and " c " , which represent those same sounds in czech ) , or the addition of completely new symbols ( as some languages have introduced the letter " w " to the latin alphabet ) or of symbols from another alphabet , such as the rune " þ " in icelandic . [SEP]
[CLS] after the classical period , greek developed a lower ##case letter system that introduced dia ##cr ##itic marks to enable foreigners to learn pronunciation and in some cases , grammatical features . [SEP]
[CLS] however , as pronunciation of letters changed over time , the dia ##cr ##itic marks were reduced to representing the stressed syllable . [SEP]
[CLS] in modern greek types ##etti ##ng , this system has been simplified to only have a single accent to indicate which syllable is stressed . [SEP]
