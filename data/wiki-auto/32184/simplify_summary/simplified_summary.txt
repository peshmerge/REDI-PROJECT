the jic is supported by the joint intelligence agency under the cabinet office .
the jic was founded on 7 july 1936 as a sub-committee of the committee of imperial defence , the advisory peacetime defence planning agency .
during world war ii it became the senior intelligence assessment body in the uk .
there were allegations that the dossier was " sexed up " before publication in order to bolster the case for military action .
evidence that the wording of the dossier was " strengthened " was presented to the hutton inquiry , a judicial review set up to investigate the circumstances leading up to the death of an expert , david kelly , who had criticised the wording of the dossier in off-the record briefings to journalists .
kelly committed suicide shortly after his identity was confirmed to the media by the government .
similarly , the us senate intelligence committee , while critical of us intelligence officials , did not recommend any resignations in its report , also issued in july 2004 .
the committee is chaired by a permanent chairman , a member of the senior civil service .
the assessment staff is made up of experienced senior analysts drawn from across government and the military .
jic papers draw input from across the intelligence and security agencies and other related bodies .
members of the cabinet are appointed to the ministry of defence , the home office , the department for international development , hm treasury and the cabinet office .
since world war ii , the chief of the london station of the united states central intelligence agency has attended the jic 's weekly meetings .
resident intelligence chiefs from australia , canada , and new zealand may attend when certain issues are discussed .
