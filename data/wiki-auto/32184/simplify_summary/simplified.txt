in 1957 the jic moved to the cabinet office .
the jic played a controversial role in making a dossier in which the uk government highlighted the threat posed by iraq 's weapons of mass destruction in the run up to the iraq war .
there were allegations that the dossier was " sexed up " before publication in order to bolster the case for military action .
evidence that the wording of the dossier was " strengthened " was presented to the hutton inquiry , a judicial review set up to investigate the circumstances leading up to the death of an expert , david kelly , who had criticised the wording of the dossier in off-the record briefings to journalists .
kelly committed suicide shortly after his identity was confirmed to the media by the government .
jic members john scarlett and sir richard dearlovewyl gave evidence to the inquiry .
