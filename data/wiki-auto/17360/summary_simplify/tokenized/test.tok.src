[CLS] a member of the monitor lizard family var ##ani ##dae , it is the largest living species of lizard , growing to a maximum length of 3 m in rare cases and weighing up to approximately 70 kg . [SEP]
[CLS] its unusually large size has been attributed to island gig ##ant ##ism , since no other car ##nivorous animals fill the niche on the islands where it lives . [SEP]
[CLS] however , recent research suggests the large size of ko ##mo ##do dragons may be better understood as representative of a relic ##t population of very large var ##ani ##d lizards that once lived across indonesia and australia , most of which , along with other mega ##fa ##una , died out after the pleistocene ( as a result of human activity ) . [SEP]
[CLS] fossils very similar to " v . ko ##mo ##do ##ensis " have been found in australia dating to more than 3 . 8 million years ago , and its body size remained stable on flores , one of the small number of indonesian islands where it is currently found , over the last 900 , 000 years , " a time marked by major fauna ##l turnover ##s , extinction of the island ' s mega ##fa ##una , and the arrival of early ho ##mini ##ds by 880 ka ki ##lo ##ann ##ums . " [SEP]
[CLS] the biological significance of these proteins is disputed , but the glands have been shown to secret ##e an anti ##co ##ag ##ula ##nt . [SEP]
[CLS] the diet of big ko ##mo ##do dragons mainly consists of timor deer , though they also eat considerable amounts of carr ##ion . [SEP]
[CLS] the eggs are inc ##uba ##ted for seven to eight months , hatch ##ing in april , when insects are most pl ##ent ##iful . [SEP]
[CLS] in the wild , their range has contracted due to human activities , and they are listed as vulnerable by the iucn . [SEP]
[CLS] ko ##mo ##do dragons were first documented by europeans in 1910 , when rumors of a " land crocodile " reached lieutenant van ste ##yn van hen ##sb ##ro ##ek of the dutch colonial administration . [SEP]
[CLS] widespread notoriety came after 1912 , when peter ou ##wen ##s , the director of the zoological museum at bog ##or , java , published a paper on the topic after receiving a photo and a skin from the lieutenant , as well as two other specimens from a collector . [SEP]
[CLS] the first two live ko ##mo ##do dragons to arrive in europe were exhibited in the rep ##tile house at london zoo when it opened in 1927 . [SEP]
[CLS] joan beau ##champ pro ##cter made some of the earliest observations of these animals in captivity and she demonstrated the behaviour of one of these animals at a scientific meeting of the zoological society of london in 1928 . [SEP]
[CLS] three of his specimens were stuffed and are still on display in the american museum of natural history . [SEP]
[CLS] the dutch , realizing the limited number of individuals in the wild , outlawed sport hunting and heavily limited the number of individuals taken for scientific study . [SEP]
[CLS] collecting expeditions ground to a halt with the occurrence of world war ii , not res ##uming until the 1950s and 1960s , when studies examined the ko ##mo ##do dragon ' s feeding behavior , reproduction , and body temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] at around this time , an expedition was planned in which a long - term study of the ko ##mo ##do dragon would be undertaken . [SEP]
[CLS] the research from the auf ##fen ##berg expedition would prove to be enormous ##ly influential in raising ko ##mo ##do dragons in captivity . [SEP]
[CLS] research after that of the auf ##fen ##berg family has shed more light on the nature of the ko ##mo ##do dragon , with biologist ##s such as claudio ci ##of ##i continuing to study the creatures . [SEP]
[CLS] the evolutionary development of the ko ##mo ##do dragon started with the genus " var ##anus " , which originated in asia about 40 million years ago and migrated to australia , where it evolved into giant forms ( the largest of all being the recently extinct " mega ##lani ##a " ) , helped by the absence of competing place ##ntal car ##ni ##vor ##ans . [SEP]
[CLS] around 15 million years ago , a collision between australia and southeast asia allowed these larger var ##ani ##ds to move back into what is now the indonesian archipelago , extending their range as far east as the island of timor . [SEP]
[CLS] the ko ##mo ##do dragon was believed to have differentiated from its australian ancestors 4 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] dramatic lowering of sea level during the last glacial period uncovered extensive stretches of continental shelf that the ko ##mo ##do dragon colon ##ised , becoming isolated in their present island range as sea levels rose afterwards . [SEP]
[CLS] extinct pl ##io ##cene species of similar size to the modern ko ##mo ##do dragon , such as " var ##anus si ##vale ##nsis " , have been found in eu ##rasia as well , indicating that they fare ##d well even in environments containing competition such as mammalian car ##ni ##vor ##es until the climate change and extinction events that marked the beginning of the pleistocene . [SEP]
[CLS] genetic analysis of mitochondrial dna shows the ko ##mo ##do dragon to be the closest relative ( sister taxon ) of the lace monitor ( " v . var ##ius " ) , with their common ancestor diver ##ging from a lineage that gave rise to the crocodile monitor ( " var ##anus salvador ##ii " ) of new guinea . [SEP]
[CLS] according to " guinness world records " , an average adult male will weigh 79 to and measure 2 . 59 m , while an average female will weigh 68 to and measure 2 . 29 m . [SEP]
[CLS] the largest verified wild specimen was 3 . 13 m long and weighed 166 kg , including und ##ige ##sted food . [SEP]
[CLS] the ko ##mo ##do dragon has a tail as long as its body , as well as about 60 frequently replaced , serra ##ted teeth that can measure up to 2 . 5 cm in length . [SEP]
[CLS] as with other var ##ani ##ds , ko ##mo ##do dragons have only a single ear bone , the st ##apes , for transferring vibrations from the ty ##mp ##ani ##c membrane to the co ##ch ##lea . [SEP]
[CLS] they were formerly thought to be deaf when a study reported no agitation in wild ko ##mo ##do dragons in response to whispers , raised voices , or shouts . [SEP]
[CLS] this was disputed when london zoological garden employee joan proctor trained a captive specimen to come out to feed at the sound of her voice , even when she could not be seen . [SEP]
[CLS] the ko ##mo ##do dragon uses its tongue to detect , taste , and smell stimuli , as with many other reptiles , with the vo ##mer ##ona ##sal sense using the jacobs ##on ' s organ , rather than using the nostrils . [SEP]
[CLS] the scales around the ears , lips , chin , and sole ##s of the feet may have three or more sensory plaques . [SEP]
[CLS] they are capable of running rapidly in brief sprint ##s up to 20 km / h , diving up to 4 . 5 m , and climbing trees proficient ##ly when young through use of their strong claws . [SEP]
[CLS] for shelter , the ko ##mo ##do dragon dig ##s holes that can measure from 1 to wide with its powerful fore ##lim ##bs and claws . [SEP]
[CLS] because of its large size and habit of sleeping in these burrows , it is able to conserve body heat throughout the night and mini ##mise its bas ##king period the morning after . [SEP]
[CLS] although they have been considered as eating mostly carr ##ion , they will frequently ambush live prey with a stealth ##y approach . [SEP]
[CLS] when suitable prey arrives near a dragon ' s ambush site , it will suddenly charge at the animal at high speeds and go for the underside or the throat . [SEP]
[CLS] ko ##mo ##do dragons do not deliberately allow the prey to escape with fatal injuries , but try to kill prey outright using a combination of lace ##rating damage and blood loss . [SEP]
[CLS] they have been recorded as killing wild pigs within seconds , and observations of ko ##mo ##do dragons tracking prey for long distances are likely mis ##int ##er ##pre ##ted cases of prey escaping an attack before su ##cc ##umb ##ing to infection . [SEP]
[CLS] they are able to locate car ##cas ##ses using their keen sense of smell , which can locate a dead or dying animal from a range of up to 9 . 5 km . [SEP]
[CLS] a ko ##mo ##do dragon may attempt to speed up the process by ram ##ming the car ##cas ##s against a tree to force it down its throat , sometimes ram ##ming so forcefully , the tree is knocked down . [SEP]
[CLS] because of their slow metabolism , large dragons can survive on as few as 12 meals a year . [SEP]
[CLS] after digest ##ion , the ko ##mo ##do dragon reg ##urg ##itate ##s a mass of horns , hair , and teeth known as the gas ##tric pe ##llet , which is covered in mal ##od ##orous mu ##cus . [SEP]
[CLS] after reg ##urg ##itating the gas ##tric pe ##llet , it rubs its face in the dirt or on bushes to get rid of the mu ##cus , suggesting it does not re ##lish the scent of its own ex ##cre ##tions . [SEP]
[CLS] the largest male asserts his dominance and the smaller males show their submission by use of body language and rumbling hiss ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] losers usually retreat , though they have been known to be killed and eaten by victor ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes they consume human corpses , digging up bodies from shallow graves . [SEP]
[CLS] this habit of raiding graves caused the villagers of ko ##mo ##do to move their graves from sandy to clay ground and pile rocks on top of them to deter the lizards . [SEP]
[CLS] the ko ##mo ##do dragon may have evolved to feed on the extinct dwarf elephant " ste ##go ##don " that once lived on flores , according to evolutionary biologist jared diamond . [SEP]
[CLS] the ko ##mo ##do dragon drinks by sucking water into its mouth via bu ##cca ##l pumping ( a process also used for res ##piration ) , lifting its head , and letting the water run down its throat . [SEP]
[CLS] although previous studies proposed that ko ##mo ##do dragon saliva contains a variety of highly sept ##ic bacteria that would help to bring down prey , research in 2013 suggested that the bacteria in the mouths of ko ##mo ##do dragons are ordinary and similar to those found in other car ##ni ##vor ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] as bryan fry put it : " after they are done feeding , they will spend 10 to 15 minutes lip - licking and rubbing their head in the leaves to clean their mouth . . . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike people have been led to believe , they do not have chunks of rotting flesh from their meals on their teeth , cult ##ivating bacteria . " [SEP]
[CLS] nor do ko ##mo ##do dragons wait for prey to die and track it at a distance , as viper ##s do ; observations of them hunting deer , boar and in some cases buffalo reveal that they kill prey in less than half an hour , using their dent ##ition to cause shock and trauma . [SEP]
[CLS] the observation of prey dying of sep ##sis would then be explained by the natural instinct of water buffalo ##s , who are not native to the islands where the ko ##mo ##do dragon lives , to run into water after escaping an attack . [SEP]
[CLS] based on their analysis of this peptide , they have synthesized a short peptide dubbed dr ##gn - 1 and tested it against multi ##dr ##ug - resistant ( md ##r ) pathogen ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] preliminary results of these tests show that dr ##gn - 1 is effective in killing drug - resistant bacterial strains and even some fungi . [SEP]
[CLS] in late 2005 , researchers at the university of melbourne speculated the pere ##nti ##e ( " var ##anus gig ##ante ##us " ) , other species of monitors , and ag ##ami ##ds may be somewhat venom ##ous . [SEP]
[CLS] bites on human digits by a lace monitor ( " v . var ##ius " ) , a ko ##mo ##do dragon , and a spotted tree monitor ( " v . scala ##ris " ) all produced similar effects : rapid swelling , local ##ised disruption of blood cl ##otti ##ng , and shooting pain up to the elbow , with some symptoms lasting for several hours . [SEP]
[CLS] mri scans of a preserved skull showed the presence of two glands in the lower jaw . [SEP]
[CLS] the researchers extracted one of these glands from the head of a terminal ##ly ill dragon in the singapore zoological gardens , and found it secret ##ed several different toxic proteins . [SEP]
[CLS] the known functions of these proteins include inhibition of blood cl ##otti ##ng , lowering of blood pressure , muscle paralysis , and the induction of h ##yp ##oth ##er ##mia , leading to shock and loss of consciousness in en ##ven ##oma ##ted prey . [SEP]
[CLS] other scientists have stated that this all ##ega ##tion of venom glands " has had the effect of under ##est ##imating the variety of complex roles played by oral secret ##ions in the biology of reptiles , produced a very narrow view of oral secret ##ions and resulted in mis ##int ##er ##pre ##tation of rep ##ti ##lian evolution " . [SEP]
[CLS] these researchers concluded that , " calling all in this clade venom ##ous implies an overall potential danger that does not exist , mis ##lea ##ds in the assessment of medical risks , and confuse ##s the biological assessment of sq ##ua ##mate bio ##chemical systems " . [SEP]
[CLS] evolutionary biologist sc ##h ##wen ##k says that even if the lizards have venom - like proteins in their mouths they may be using them for a different function , and he doubts venom is necessary to explain the effect of a ko ##mo ##do dragon bite , arguing that shock and blood loss are the primary factors . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period , males fight over females and territory by gr ##app ##ling with one another upon their hind legs , with the loser eventually being pinned to the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] the winner of the fight will then flick his long tongue at the female to gain information about her rec ##ept ##ivity . [SEP]
[CLS] females are antagonist ##ic and resist with their claws and teeth during the early phases of courtship . [SEP]
[CLS] female ko ##mo ##dos lay their eggs from august to september and may use several types of locality ; in one study , 60 % laid their eggs in the nests of orange - footed scrub ##fo ##wl ( a mound ##bu ##ilde ##r or mega ##pod ##e ) , 20 % on ground level and 20 % in hilly areas . [SEP]
[CLS] after cutting themselves out , the hatch ##lings may lie in their eggs ##hell ##s for hours before starting to dig out of the nest . [SEP]
[CLS] young ko ##mo ##do dragons spend much of their first few years in trees , where they are relatively safe from predators , including can ##ni ##bal ##istic adults , as juvenile dragons make up 10 % of their diet ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the habit of can ##ni ##bal ##ism may be advantage ##ous in sustaining the large size of adults , as medium - sized prey on the islands is rare . [SEP]
[CLS] when the young approach a kill , they roll around in fae ##cal matter and rest in the int ##est ##ines of ev ##is ##cera ##ted animals to deter these hungry adults . [SEP]
[CLS] a ko ##mo ##do dragon at london zoo named sung ##ai laid a clutch of eggs in late 2005 after being separated from male company for more than two years . [SEP]
[CLS] scientists initially assumed she had been able to store sperm from her earlier encounter with a male , an adaptation known as super ##fe ##cu ##nda ##tion . [SEP]
[CLS] on 20 december 2006 , it was reported that flora , a captive ko ##mo ##do dragon living in the chester zoo in england , was the second known ko ##mo ##do dragon to have laid un ##fer ##ti ##lis ##ed eggs : she laid 11 eggs , and seven of them hatch ##ed , all of them male . [SEP]
[CLS] scientists at liverpool university in england performed genetic tests on three eggs that collapsed after being moved to an inc ##uba ##tor , and verified flora had never been in physical contact with a male dragon . [SEP]
[CLS] only two eggs were inc ##uba ##ted and hatch ##ed due to space issues ; the first hatch ##ed on 31 january 2008 , while the second hatch ##ed on 1 february . [SEP]
[CLS] ko ##mo ##do dragons have the z ##w ch ##rom ##osomal sex - determination system , as opposed to the mammalian x ##y system . [SEP]
[CLS] male pro ##geny prove flora ' s un ##fer ##ti ##lis ##ed eggs were ha ##pl ##oid ( n ) and doubled their chromosomes later to become dip ##loid ( 2 ##n ) ( by being fe ##rti ##lis ##ed by a polar body , or by chromosome du ##plication without cell division ) , rather than by her laying dip ##loid eggs by one of the mei ##osis reduction - divisions in her o ##var ##ies failing . [SEP]
[CLS] when a female ko ##mo ##do dragon ( with z ##w sex chromosomes ) reproduce ##s in this manner , she provides her pro ##geny with only one chromosome from each of her pairs of chromosomes , including only one of her two sex chromosomes . [SEP]
[CLS] eggs receiving a z chromosome become z ##z ( male ) ; those receiving a w chromosome become w ##w and fail to develop , meaning that only males are produced by part ##hen ##ogen ##esis in this species . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been hypothesis ##ed that this reproductive adaptation allows a single female to enter an isolated ecological niche ( such as an island ) and by part ##hen ##ogen ##esis produce male offspring , thereby establishing a sexually rep ##rod ##uc ##ing population ( via reproduction with her offspring that can result in both male and female young ) . [SEP]
[CLS] attacks on humans are rare , but this species has been responsible for several human fatalities , in both the wild and captivity . [SEP]
[CLS] the ko ##mo ##do dragon is a vulnerable species and is on the iucn red list . [SEP]
[CLS] later , the wa ##e wu ##ul and wo ##lo tad ##o reserves were opened on flores to aid with ko ##mo ##do dragon conservation . [SEP]
[CLS] juveniles are very shy and will flee quickly into a hideout if a human comes closer than about 100 m . [SEP]
[CLS] older animals will also retreat from humans from a shorter distance away . [SEP]
[CLS] although there are an ##ec ##dote ##s of un ##pro ##vo ##ked ko ##mo ##do dragons attacking or prey ##ing on humans , most of these reports are either not rep ##utable or caused by defensive bites . [SEP]
[CLS] only a very few cases are truly the result of un ##pro ##vo ##ked attacks by abnormal individuals , which lost their fear of humans . [SEP]
[CLS] volcanic activity , earthquakes , loss of habitat , fire , loss of prey due to po ##achi ##ng , tourism , and illegal po ##achi ##ng of the dragons themselves have all contributed to the vulnerable status of the ko ##mo ##do dragon . [SEP]
[CLS] on pad ##ar , a former population of the ko ##mo ##do dragon became extinct , of which the last individuals were seen in 1975 . [SEP]
[CLS] it is widely assumed that the ko ##mo ##do dragon died out on pad ##ar after a strong decline of the populations of large un ##gul ##ate prey , for which po ##achi ##ng was most likely responsible . [SEP]
[CLS] ko ##mo ##do dragons have long been great zoo attractions , where their size and reputation make them popular exhibits . [SEP]
[CLS] they are , however , rare in zoo ##s because they are susceptible to infection and parasitic disease if captured from the wild , and do not readily reproduce . [SEP]
[CLS] more attempts to exhibit ko ##mo ##do dragons were made , but the lifespan of these animals was very short , averaging five years in the national zoological park . [SEP]
[CLS] studies done by walter auf ##fen ##berg , which were documented in his book " the behavioral ecology of the ko ##mo ##do monitor " , eventually allowed for more successful managing and rep ##rod ##uc ##ing of the dragons in captivity . [SEP]
[CLS] most individuals are relatively tame within a short time , and are capable of rec ##og ##nis ##ing individual humans and disc ##rim ##inating between familiar keepers . [SEP]
[CLS] ko ##mo ##do dragons have also been observed to engage in play with a variety of objects , including shovel ##s , cans , plastic rings , and shoes . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 2001 , a ko ##mo ##do dragon seriously injured phil bro ##nstein , the then husband of actress sharon stone , when he entered its enclosure at the los angeles zoo after being invited in by its keeper . [SEP]
[CLS] the most recent attempt was in march 2019 when indonesian police in the east java city of sur ##aba ##ya reported that a criminal network had been caught trying to smug ##gle 41 young ko ##mo ##do out of indonesia . [SEP]
[CLS] the plan was said to include shipping the animals to several other countries in southeast asia through singapore . [SEP]
[CLS] it was believed that the ko ##mo ##do had been smug ##gled out of east nu ##sa ten ##gga ##ra province through the port at end ##e in central flores . [SEP]
