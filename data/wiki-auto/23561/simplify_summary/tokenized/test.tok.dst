[CLS] para ##nt ##hr ##opus ( from greek π ##α ##ρ ##α , " para " " beside " ; α ##ν ##θ ##ρ ##ω ##π ##ος , " ant ##hr ##op ##os " " human " ) is a genus of extinct ho ##mini ##ns that lived between 2 . 6 and 1 . 1 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] also known as robust aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ecin ##es , they were bi ##ped ##al ho ##mini ##ds probably descended from the gr ##ac ##ile aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ecin ##e ho ##mini ##ds ( " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " ) 2 . 7 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] the genus is characterised by robust cr ##ani ##ode ##ntal anatomy , including gorilla - like sa ##git ##tal cr ##anial crest ##s which suggest strong muscles of mast ##ication , and broad , grinding herb ##ivo ##rous teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] however , " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " skulls lack the transverse cr ##anial crest ##s of modern gorilla ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the low rate of enamel fractures on " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " teeth suggest this characteristic cr ##ani ##ode ##ntal anatomy evolved to cope with a diet of tough vegetation , rather than hard foods . [SEP]
[CLS] a partial cr ##ani ##um and man ##di ##ble of " para ##nt ##hr ##opus robust ##us " was discovered in 1938 by a school ##boy , ge ##rt ter ##bla ##nche , at k ##rom ##dra ##ai b ( 70 km south west of pretoria ) in south africa . [SEP]
[CLS] it was described as a new genus and species by robert broom of the transvaal museum . [SEP]
[CLS] the site has been excavated since 1993 by francis tha ##cker ##ay of the transvaal museum . [SEP]
[CLS] a date of at least 1 . 95 million years has been obtained for k ##rom ##dra ##ai b . " para ##nt ##hr ##opus boise ##i " was discovered by mary leak ##ey on july 17 , 1959 , at the fl ##k bed i site of old ##u ##va ##i gorge in tanzania ( specimen oh 5 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] mary was working alone , as louis leak ##ey was ill in camp . [SEP]
[CLS] she rushed back to camp and , at the news , louis made a remarkable recovery . [SEP]
[CLS] they refrain ##ed from ex ##ca ##vating until des bartlett had photographed the site . [SEP]
[CLS] in louis recorded a first name , " titan ##oh ##omo mira ##bilis " , reflecting an initial impression of close human affinity . [SEP]
[CLS] louis and mary began to call it " dear boy " . [SEP]
[CLS] recovery was halted on august 7 . [SEP]
[CLS] " dear boy " was found in context with old ##owa ##n tools and animal bones . [SEP]
[CLS] the fossil was published in " nature " dated august 15 , 1959 , but due to a strike of the printers the issue was not released until september . [SEP]
[CLS] in it louis placed the fossil in william king gregory ' s subfamily aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ecin ##ae , creating a new genus for it , " z ##in ##jan ##th ##rop ##us " , species " boise ##i " , which is no longer used . [SEP]
[CLS] " z ##in ##j " is an ancient arabic word for the coast of east africa and " boise ##i " referred to charles watson boise , an anthropological benefactor of the leak ##ey ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] louis based his classification on twenty differences from " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " . [SEP]
[CLS] at that time pal ##ae ##oa ##nt ##hr ##op ##ology was in an overall mood to lump species . [SEP]
[CLS] consequently , the presentation of z ##in ##j during the fourth pan - african congress of pre ##his ##tori ##ans in july in the then belgian congo , at which louis was forced to read the delayed " nature " article , nearly came to grief for louis over the creation of a new genus . [SEP]
[CLS] dart rescued him with the now famous joke , " . . . what would have happened if mrs . pl ##es had met dear boy one dark night . " [SEP]
[CLS] the battle of the name went on for many years and drove a wedge between louis and sir wil ##frid leg ##ros clark , from 1955 , who took the " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " view . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , it brought the leak ##ey ##s and dr . melville bell gr ##os ##venor of the national geographic society together . [SEP]
[CLS] the leak ##ey ##s became international figures and had no trouble finding funds from then on . [SEP]
[CLS] the z ##in ##j question ultimately became part of the " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " / " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " question ( which only applied to the robust aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ecin ##es ) . [SEP]
[CLS] all species of " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " were bi ##ped ##al , and many lived during a time when species of the genus " homo " ( which were possibly descended from " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " ) , were prevalent . [SEP]
[CLS] " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " first appeared roughly 2 . 7 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] most species of " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " had a brain about 40 percent the size of that of a modern human . [SEP]
[CLS] there was some size variation between the different species of " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " , but most stood roughly tall and were quite well muscled . [SEP]
[CLS] " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " is thought to have lived in wooded areas rather than the grasslands of " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " . [SEP]
[CLS] " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " is thought to be bi ##ped ##al based on the anatomical structure of its hips , legs , and feet , which resemble both its ancestor , " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us afar ##ensis " , and modern humans . [SEP]
[CLS] the pe ##lvis is similar to " a . afar ##ensis " , but the hip joint , including the fe ##moral head and ace ##ta ##bu ##lum , are smaller in " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " . [SEP]
[CLS] the similar hip structure between " a . afar ##ensis " and " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " implies that they had a similar walking ga ##it , and that " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " moved like the " gr ##ac ##ile aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] they show anatomical similarity to modern humans in the big toe of their foot and their well developed plant ##ar ap ##one ##uro ##sis . [SEP]
[CLS] the hall ##ux meta ##tar ##sal shows increased base for more internal support , and more distal art ##icular surface which causes more connection and support to the other bones in the foot . [SEP]
[CLS] the extra support in the big toe and extensive plant ##ar ap ##one ##uro ##sis shows that " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " had hyper ##ex ##tension of their toes for a " toe - off " ga ##it cycle , characteristic of modern bi ##ped ##alis ##m in humans . [SEP]
[CLS] the behavior of " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " was quite different from that of the genus " homo " , in that it was not as adapt ##able to its environment or as resource ##ful . [SEP]
[CLS] evidence exists in its anatomy , which was specifically tailored to a diet of gr ##ub ##s and plants . [SEP]
[CLS] this would have made it more re ##lian ##t on favorable environmental conditions than members of the genus " homo " , which consumed a much wider variety of foods . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , because it was a specialist species , it had more difficulty adapting to a changing climate , leading to its extinction . [SEP]
[CLS] evolutionary biologist richard da ##wk ##ins notes " perhaps several different species " of robust ho ##mini ##ds , and " as usual their af ##fin ##ities , and the exact number of species , are hot ##ly disputed . [SEP]
[CLS] names that have been attached to various of these creatures . . . are " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " ( or " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " ) " robust ##us " , " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " ( or " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " or " z ##in ##jan ##th ##rop ##us " ) " boise ##i " , and " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " ( or " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " ) " ae ##thi ##op ##icus " . " [SEP]
[CLS] opinions differ whether the species " p . ae ##thi ##op ##icus , p . boise ##i " and " p . robust ##us " should be included within the genus " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " . [SEP]
[CLS] the emergence of the robust ##s could be either a display of diver ##gent or converge ##nt evolution . [SEP]
[CLS] there is currently no consensus in the scientific community whether " p . ae ##thi ##op ##icus , p . boise ##i " and " p . robust ##us " should be placed into a distinct genus , " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " , which is believed to have evolved from the ancestral " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " line . [SEP]
[CLS] up through the late 20th century the majority of the scientific community included all the species of both " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " and " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " in a single genus . [SEP]
[CLS] currently , both taxonomic systems are used and accepted in the scientific community . [SEP]
[CLS] however , although " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us robust ##us " and " para ##nt ##hr ##opus robust ##us " are used interchange ##ably for the same specimens , some researchers , beginning with robert broom , and continuing with people such as bernard a . wood , think that there is a difference between " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " and " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " , and that there should be two genera . [SEP]
[CLS] however , this discussion appears largely mo ##ot as the genus homo also appears to have emerged in the genus aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us , and a genus can formally not be part of another genus . [SEP]
[CLS] for the most part the " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " species " a . afar ##ensis " , " a . african ##us " , and " a . ana ##men ##sis " either disappeared from the fossil record before the appearance of early humans or seem to have been the ancestors of " homo ha ##bilis " , yet " p . boise ##i " and " p . ae ##thi ##op ##icus " continued to evolve along a separate path distinct and unrelated to early humans . [SEP]
[CLS] " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " shared the earth with some early examples of the genus " homo " , such as " h . ha ##bilis " , " h . er ##gas ##ter " , and possibly even " h . erect ##us " . [SEP]
[CLS] " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us afar ##ensis " and " a . ana ##men ##sis " had mostly disappeared by this time . [SEP]
[CLS] there were significant morphological differences between " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " and " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " , although the differences were found on the cr ##anial remains . [SEP]
[CLS] the post ##cr ##anial remains were still very similar . [SEP]
[CLS] " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " was more massive ##ly built cr ##ani ##ode ##ntal ##ly and tended to contain gorilla - like sa ##git ##tal crest ##s on the cr ##ani ##um which anchored massive temporal ##is muscles of mast ##ication . [SEP]
[CLS] species of " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " had smaller brain ##case ##s than " homo " , yet they had significantly larger brain ##case ##s than " aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ec ##us " . [SEP]
[CLS] " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " is associated with stone tools both in southern and eastern africa , although there is considerable debate whether they were made and utilized by these robust aus ##tral ##op ##ith ##ecin ##es or con ##tem ##por ##aneous " homo " . [SEP]
[CLS] most believe that early " homo " was the tool maker , but hand fossils from sw ##art ##kra ##ns , south africa , indicate that the hand of " para ##nt ##hr ##opus robust ##us " was also adapted for precision grasping and tool use . [SEP]
[CLS] most " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " species seem almost certainly not to have used language nor to have controlled fire , although they are directly associated with the latter at sw ##art ##kra ##ns . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2011 th ##ure e . ce ##rling of the university of utah and colleagues , published a study in the " proceedings of the national academy of sciences " of their work with the carbon isotope ##s in the enamel of 24 teeth from 22 " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " individuals who lived in east africa between 1 . 4 million and 1 . 9 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] their results suggest that " para ##nt ##hr ##opus boise ##i " din ##ed more heavily on c ##4 plants , possibly as a part - time gram ##ini ##vor ##e ( as many grass species are c ##4 plants ) , than any other human ancestor or human relative studied to date . [SEP]
[CLS] it is debated whether the large mo ##lars of " para ##nt ##hr ##opus " was an adaptation to eating hard foods , however recent research , including a low rate of enamel fractures in " para ##nt ##hr ##opus robust ##us " , suggests a diet containing tough vegetation was more commonly consumed .
