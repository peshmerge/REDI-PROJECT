[CLS] e - prime ( short for english - prime or english prime , sometimes denoted e or e â€² ) is a version of the english language that exclude ##s all forms of the verb " to be " , including all con ##ju ##gation ##s , contraction ##s and archaic forms . [SEP]
[CLS] some scholars advocate using e - prime as a device to clarify thinking and strengthen writing . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of other scholars have criticized e - prime ' s utility . [SEP]
[CLS] d . david bo ##ur ##land jr . , who had studied under alfred ko ##rzy ##bs ##ki , devised e - prime as an addition to ko ##rzy ##bs ##ki ' s general semantics in the late 1940s . [SEP]
[CLS] bo ##ur ##land published the concept in a 1965 essay entitled " a linguistic note : writing in e - prime " ( originally published in " general semantics bulletin " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the essay quickly generated controversy within the general semantics field , partly because practitioners of general semantics sometimes saw bo ##ur ##land as attacking the verb ' " to be " ' as such , and not just certain usage ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] bo ##ur ##land collected and published three volumes of essays in support of his innovation . [SEP]
[CLS] the first ( 1991 ) , co - edited by paul den ##ni ##thor ##ne johnston , bore the title : " to be or not : an e - prime anthology " . [SEP]
[CLS] for the second , " more e - prime : to be or not ii " , published in 1994 , he added a third editor , jeremy klein . [SEP]
[CLS] bo ##ur ##land and johnston then edited a third book , " e - prime iii : a third anthology " , published in 1997 . [SEP]
[CLS] bo ##ur ##land sees specifically the " identity " and " pre ##dication " functions as per ##nic ##ious , but advocates eliminating all forms for the sake of simplicity . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of the " existence " form ( and less id ##iom ##atic ##ally , the " location " form ) , one might ( for example ) simply substitute the verb " exists " . [SEP]
[CLS] other cop ##ula - substitutes in english include " taste " , " feel " , " smell " , " sound " , " grow " , " remain " , " stay " , and " turn " , among others a user of e - prime might use instead of " to be " . [SEP]
[CLS] words not used in e - prime include : be , being , been , am , is , isn ' t , are , aren ' t , was , wasn ' t , were , and weren ' t . [SEP]
[CLS] contraction ##s formed from a pro ##no ##un and a form of " to be " are also not used , including : i ' m , you ' re , we ' re , they ' re , he ' s , she ' s , it ' s , there ' s , here ' s , where ' s , how ' s , what ' s , who ' s , and that ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] e - prime also prohibits contraction ##s of " to be " found in non ##stand ##ard dialects of english , such as " ain ' t " . [SEP]
[CLS] bo ##ur ##land and other advocates also suggest that use of e - prime leads to a less dog ##matic style of language that reduces the possibility of misunderstanding or conflict . [SEP]
[CLS] kellogg and bo ##ur ##land describe mis ##use of the verb " to be " as creating a " deity mode of speech " , allowing " even the most ignorant to transform their opinions magical ##ly into god - like pro ##no ##unce ##ments on the nature of things " . [SEP]
[CLS] while teaching at the university of florida , alfred ko ##rzy ##bs ##ki counsel ##ed his students to eliminate the in ##fin ##itive and verb forms of " to be " from their vocabulary , whereas a second group continued to use " i am , " " you are , " " they are " statements as usual . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , instead of saying , " i am depressed , " a student was asked to eliminate that emotionally prime ##d verb and to say something else , such as , " i feel depressed when . . . " or " i tend to make myself depressed about . . . " ko ##rzy ##bs ##ki observed improvement " of one full letter grade " by " students who did not general ##ize by using that in ##fin ##itive " . [SEP]
[CLS] albert ellis advocated the use of e - prime when discussing psychological distress to encourage framing these experiences as temporary ( see also solution focused brief therapy ) and to encourage a sense of agency by specify ##ing the subject of statements . [SEP]
[CLS] according to ellis , rational em ##ot ##ive behavior therapy " has favored e - prime more than any other form of psycho ##therapy and i think it is still the only form of therapy that has some of its main books written in e - prime " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , ellis did not always use e - prime because he believed it interfere ##s with read ##ability . [SEP]
[CLS] many authors have questioned e - prime ' s effectiveness at improving read ##ability and reducing prejudice ( la ##koff , 1992 ; murphy , 1992 ; parkinson , 1992 ; ken ##yon , 1992 ; french , 1992 , 1993 ; lo ##hre ##y , 1993 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these authors observed that a communication under the cop ##ula ban can remain extremely unclear and imply prejudice , while losing important speech patterns , such as identities and identification . [SEP]
[CLS] further , prejudice ##s and judgments that are made are more difficult to notice or ref ##ute . [SEP]
[CLS] according to an article ( written in e - prime and advocating a role for e - prime in es ##l and e ##fl programs ) published by the office of english language programs of the bureau of educational and cultural affairs in the state department of the united states , " requiring students to avoid the verb to be on every assignment would deter students from developing other fundamental skills of fluent writing .
