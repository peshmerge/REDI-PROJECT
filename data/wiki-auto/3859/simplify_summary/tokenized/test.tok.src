[CLS] the award was established in 1940 by the chicago chapter of the bb ##wa ##a , which selected an annual winner from 1940 through 1946 . [SEP]
[CLS] the award became national in 1947 ; jackie robinson , the brooklyn dodgers ' second baseman , won the inaugural award . [SEP]
[CLS] one award was presented for all of mlb in 1947 and 1948 ; since 1949 , the honor has been given to one player each in the nl and al . [SEP]
[CLS] originally , the award was known as the j . louis com ##isk ##ey memorial award , named after the chicago white sox owner of the 1930s . [SEP]
[CLS] the award was renamed the jackie robinson award in july 1987 , 40 years after robinson broke the baseball color line . [SEP]

[CLS] from 1947 through 1956 , each bb ##wa ##a voter used discretion as to who qualified as a rookie . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1957 , the term was first defined as someone with fewer than 75 at bats or 45 innings pitched in any previous major league season . [SEP]
[CLS] this guide ##line was later amended to 90 at bats , 45 innings pitched , or 45 days on a major league roster before september 1 of the previous year . [SEP]

[CLS] ed ##ins ##on vol ##que ##z received three second - place votes in 2008 ballot ##ing despite no longer being a rookie under the award ' s definition . [SEP]
[CLS] the award has drawn criticism in recent years because several players with experience in nippon professional baseball ( np ##b ) have won the award , such as hide ##o no ##mo in 1995 , ka ##zu ##hiro sas ##aki in 2000 , ich ##iro suzuki in 2001 , and sho ##hei oh ##tani in 2018 . [SEP]
[CLS] the current definition of rookie status for the award is based only on major league experience , but some feel that past np ##b players are not true rookie ##s because of their past professional experience . [SEP]
[CLS] others , however , believe it should make no difference since the first recipient and the award ' s namesake played for the negro leagues prior to his mlb career and thus could also not be considered a " true rookie " . [SEP]
[CLS] this issue arose in 2003 when hide ##ki mats ##ui narrowly lost the al award to angel be ##rro ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] jim so ##uh ##an of the " minneapolis star tribune " said he did not see mats ##ui as a rookie in 2003 because " it would be an insult to the japanese league to pretend that experience didn ' t count . " [SEP]
[CLS] " the japan times " ran a story in 2007 on the labeling of dai ##suke mats ##uz ##aka , kei i ##gawa , and hide ##ki ok ##aj ##ima as rookie ##s , saying " these guys aren ' t rookie ##s . " [SEP]
[CLS] past winners such as jackie robinson , don new ##combe , and sam jet ##hr ##oe had professional experience in the negro leagues . [SEP]
