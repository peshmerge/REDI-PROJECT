The Premier of Victoria is the head of government in the Australian state of Victoria.
The Premier is appointed by the governor of Victoria, and is the leader of the political party able to secure a majority in the Legislative Assembly.
Responsible government came to the colony of Victoria in 1855.
Between 1856 and 1892, the head of the government was commonly called the premier or the prime minister, but neither title had any legal basis.
The head of government always held another portfolio, usually Chief Secretary or Treasurer, for which they were paid a salary.
The first head of government to hold the title of premier without holding another portfolio was William Shiels in 1892.
The incumbent premier of Victoria since the 2014 election is Daniel Andrews of the Australian Labor Party.
As of none }} , six former premiers are alive, the oldest being John Cain Jr. (1982–1990, born 1931).
The most recent (and also most-recently serving) Premier to die was Joan Kirner (1990–92), on 1 June 2015.
