[CLS] theoretical chemistry is the branch of chemistry which develops theoretical general ##izations that are part of the theoretical arsenal of modern chemistry : for example , the concepts of chemical bonding , chemical reaction , vale ##nce , the surface of potential energy , molecular orbital ##s , orbital interactions , molecule activation , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] theoretical chemistry unite ##s principles and concepts common to all branches of chemistry . [SEP]
[CLS] within the framework of theoretical chemistry , there is a system ##ati ##zation of chemical laws , principles and rules , their ref ##ine ##ment and detailing , the construction of a hierarchy . [SEP]
[CLS] the central place in theoretical chemistry is occupied by the doctrine of the inter ##con ##ne ##ction of the structure and properties of molecular systems . [SEP]
[CLS] it uses mathematical and physical methods to explain the structures and dynamics of chemical systems and to co ##rre ##late , understand , and predict their the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mic and kinetic properties . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast to theoretical physics , in connection with the high complexity of chemical systems , theoretical chemistry , in addition to approximate mathematical methods , often uses semi - empirical and empirical methods . [SEP]
[CLS] chemical dynamics includes : bi ##mo ##le ##cular kinetic ##s and the collision theory of reactions and energy transfer ; un ##imo ##le ##cular rate theory and meta ##sta ##ble states ; condensed - phase and macro ##mo ##le ##cular aspects of dynamics . [SEP]
[CLS] with the rise of the density functional theory and other methods like molecular mechanics , the range of application has been extended to chemical systems which are relevant to other fields of chemistry and physics , including biochemistry , condensed matter physics , nano ##tech ##nology or molecular biology . [SEP]
