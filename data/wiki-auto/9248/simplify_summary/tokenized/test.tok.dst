[CLS] es ##per ##anto is the most widely spoken constructed international auxiliary language . [SEP]
[CLS] it was created in the late 19th century by l . l . za ##men ##hof . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1887 he published a book detailing the language , " un ##ua li ##bro " ( " first book " ) , under the pseudonym dr . es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] " es ##per ##anto " translates to english as " one who hopes " . [SEP]
[CLS] za ##men ##hof ' s goal was to create an easy and flexible language that would serve as a universal second language to foster peace and international understanding , and to build a community of speakers , as he correctly in ##fer ##red that one could not have a language without a community of speakers . [SEP]
[CLS] his original title for the language was simply the international language ( " ling ##vo intern ##ac ##ia " ) , but early speakers grew fond of the name " es ##per ##anto " and began to use it as the name for the language in 1889 ; the name quickly gained prominence and has been used as an official name ever since . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1905 , za ##men ##hof published " fund ##ament ##o de es ##per ##anto " as a definitive guide to the language . [SEP]
[CLS] later that year , he organized the first world es ##per ##anto congress , an ongoing annual conference , in bo ##ulo ##gne - sur - mer , france . [SEP]
[CLS] the first congress ratified the declaration of bo ##ulo ##gne , which established several foundation ##al premises for the es ##per ##anto movement . [SEP]
[CLS] one of its pro ##no ##unce ##ments is that " fund ##ament ##o de es ##per ##anto " is the only obligatory authority over the language . [SEP]
[CLS] another is that the es ##per ##anto movement is exclusively a linguistic movement and that no further meaning can ever be ascribed to it . [SEP]
[CLS] za ##men ##hof also proposed to the first congress that an independent body of linguistic scholars should steward the future evolution of es ##per ##anto , fore ##sha ##do ##wing the founding of the aka ##de ##mi ##o de es ##per ##anto ( in part modeled after the academie francaise ) which was established soon thereafter . [SEP]
[CLS] since 1905 , congresses have been held in various countries every year , with the exceptions of years during the world wars . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1908 , a group of young es ##per ##anto speakers led by hector ho ##dler established the universal es ##per ##anto association , in order to provide a central organization for the global es ##per ##anto community . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto grew throughout the 20th century , both as a language and as a linguistic community . [SEP]
[CLS] despite speakers facing persecution in regimes such as nazi germany and the soviet union under stalin , es ##per ##anto speakers continued to establish organizations and publish periodicals tailored to specific regions and interests . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1954 , the united nations granted official support to es ##per ##anto as an international auxiliary language in the montevideo resolution . [SEP]
[CLS] several writers have contributed to the growing body of es ##per ##anto literature , including william au ##ld , who received the first nomination for the nobel prize in literature for a literary work in es ##per ##anto in 1999 , followed by two more in 2004 and 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto - language writers are also officially represented in pen international , the worldwide writers association , through es ##per ##anto pen centro . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto has continued to develop in the 21st century . [SEP]
[CLS] the advent of the internet has had a significant impact on the language , as learning it has become increasingly accessible on platforms such as duo ##ling ##o and as speakers have increasingly network ##ed on platforms such as ami ##ku ##mu . [SEP]
[CLS] with approximately two ##mill ##ion speakers , a small portion of whom are native speakers , it is the most widely spoken constructed language in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] although no country has adopted es ##per ##anto officially , es ##per ##ant ##uj ##o is the collective name given to places where it is spoken , and the language is widely employed in world travel , correspondence , cultural exchange , conventions , literature , language instruction , television and radio broadcasting . [SEP]
[CLS] while its advocates continue to hope for the day that es ##per ##anto becomes officially recognized as the international auxiliary language , an increasing number have stopped focusing on this goal and instead view the es ##per ##anto community as a " state ##less dia ##sp ##oric linguistic minority " based on freedom of association , with a culture worthy of preservation based on its own merit . [SEP]
[CLS] some have also chosen to learn es ##per ##anto due to its purported help in third language acquisition . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the database " et ##hn ##olo ##gue " ( published by the summer institute of linguistics ) , up to two million people worldwide , to varying degrees , speak es ##per ##anto , including about 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 native speakers who learned es ##per ##anto from birth . [SEP]
[CLS] the universal es ##per ##anto association has more than 550 ##0 members in 120 countries . [SEP]
[CLS] its usage is highest in europe , east asia , and south america . [SEP]
[CLS] is one of the most popular on - line learning platforms for es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] already in 2013 , the " le ##rn ##u . net " site reported 150 , 000 registered users and had between 150 , 000 and 200 , 000 visitors each month . [SEP]
[CLS] le ##rn ##u currently has nearly 291 , 000 registered users , who are able to view the site ' s interface in their choice of 23 languages – catalan , chinese ( both " simplified " and " traditional " characters ) danish , english , es ##per ##anto , finnish , french , georgian , german , hebrew , hungarian , italian , ki ##run ##di , ki ##sw ##ah ##ili , norwegian ( " bo ##km ##al " ) , persian , portuguese , romanian , russian , serbian , slovak , swedish and ukrainian ; a further six languages — bulgarian , croatian , czech , dutch , indonesian and spanish – have at least 60 percent of the interface localized ; nine additional languages – greek , japanese , korean , lithuanian , polish , slovenian , thai , turkish and vietnamese – are in varying stages of completing the interface translation . [SEP]
[CLS] about 50 , 000 le ##rn ##u . net users possess at least a basic understanding of es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] with about articles , es ##per ##anto wikipedia ( vi ##ki ##ped ##io ) is the 32nd - largest wikipedia , as measured by the number of articles , and is the largest wikipedia in a constructed language . [SEP]
[CLS] about 151 , 000 users consult the vi ##ki ##ped ##io regularly . [SEP]
[CLS] on february 22 , 2012 , google translate added es ##per ##anto as its 64 ##th language . [SEP]
[CLS] on july 25 , 2016 , yan ##de ##x translate added es ##per ##anto as a language . [SEP]
[CLS] on may 28 , 2015 , the language learning platform duo ##ling ##o launched a free es ##per ##anto course for english speakers . [SEP]
[CLS] on march 25 , 2016 , when the first duo ##ling ##o es ##per ##anto course completed its beta - testing phase , that course had 350 , 000 people registered to learn es ##per ##anto through the medium of english . [SEP]
[CLS] s of 27 2017 , over one million users had begun learning es ##per ##anto on duo ##ling ##o ; by july 2018 the number of learners had risen to 1 . 36 million . [SEP]
[CLS] on july 20 , 2018 , duo ##ling ##o changed from recording users cumulative ##ly ; it now reports only the number of " active learners " , i . e . , those who are currently studying , but not those who have completed the course . [SEP]
[CLS] on october 26 , 2016 , a second duo ##ling ##o es ##per ##anto course , for which the language of instruction is spanish , appeared on the same platform and currently has a further 306 , 000 students . [SEP]
[CLS] a third es ##per ##anto course , taught in brazilian portuguese , began its beta - testing phase on may 14 , 2018 , and 179 , 000 people are currently using this course to learn the international language . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is now one of 27 courses that duo ##ling ##o teaches through english , one of nine courses taught through spanish and one of six courses taught through portuguese . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto was created in the late 1870s and early 1880s by l . l . za ##men ##hof , a polish - jewish op ##ht ##hal ##mo ##logist from bi ##a ##ł ##yst ##ok , then part of the russian empire but now part of poland . [SEP]
[CLS] according to za ##men ##hof , he created the language to reduce the " time and labour we spend in learning foreign tongues " and to foster harmony between people from different countries : " were there but an international language , all translations would be made into it alone . . . and all nations would be united in a common brotherhood . " [SEP]
[CLS] about his goals za ##men ##hof wrote that he wants mankind to " learn and use " , " en mass ##e " , " the proposed language as a living one " . [SEP]
[CLS] the goal for es ##per ##anto to become a general world language was not the only goal of za ##men ##hof ; he also wanted to " enable the learn ##er to make direct use of his knowledge with persons of any nationality , whether the language be universally accepted or not ; in other words , the language is to be directly a means of international communication . " [SEP]
[CLS] after some ten years of development , which za ##men ##hof spent translating literature into es ##per ##anto as well as writing original prose and verse , the first book of es ##per ##anto grammar was published in warsaw on july 26 , 1887 . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of speakers grew rapidly over the next few decades , at first primarily in the russian empire and central europe , then in other parts of europe , the americas , china , and japan . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early years , speakers of es ##per ##anto kept in contact primarily through correspondence and periodicals , but in 1905 the first world congress of es ##per ##anto speakers was held in bo ##ulo ##gne - sur - mer , france . [SEP]
[CLS] since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year , except during the two world wars . [SEP]
[CLS] since the second world war , they have been attended by an average of more than 2000 people and up to 6000 people . [SEP]
[CLS] za ##men ##hof ' s name for the language was simply ( " international language " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the autonomous territory of neutral more ##s ##net , between what is today belgium and germany , had a sizable proportion of es ##per ##anto - speakers among its small and multi - ethnic population . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a proposal to make es ##per ##anto its official language . [SEP]
[CLS] however , neither belgium nor prussia ( now within germany ) had ever surrendered its original claim to it . [SEP]
[CLS] around 1900 , germany in particular was taking a more aggressive stance towards the territory and was accused of sabotage and of ob ##st ##ru ##cting the administrative process in order to force the issue . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the first world war , however , that was the catalyst that brought about the end of neutrality . [SEP]
[CLS] on august 4 , 1914 , germany invaded belgium , leaving more ##s ##net at first " an oasis in a desert of destruction " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1915 , the territory was annexed by the kingdom of prussia , without international recognition . [SEP]
[CLS] after the great war , a great opportunity seemed to arise for es ##per ##anto when the iranian delegation to the league of nations proposed that it be adopted for use in international relations , following a report by ni ##to ##be ina ##zo , an official delegate of the league of nations during the 13th world congress of es ##per ##anto in prague . [SEP]
[CLS] ten delegates accepted the proposal with only one voice against , the french delegate , gabriel han ##ota ##ux . [SEP]
[CLS] han ##ota ##ux did not like how the french language was losing its position as the international language and saw es ##per ##anto as a threat , effectively wielding his veto power to block the decision . [SEP]
[CLS] however , two years later , the league recommended that its member states include es ##per ##anto in their educational cu ##rri ##cula . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , many people see the 1920s as the hey ##day of the es ##per ##anto movement . [SEP]
[CLS] ana ##rch ##ism as a political movement was very supportive during this time of ana ##tion ##alis ##m as well as of the es ##per ##anto language . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto attracted the suspicion of many states . [SEP]
[CLS] the situation was especially pronounced in nazi germany , francois ##t spain up until the 1950s , and in the soviet union from 1937 to 1956 . [SEP]
[CLS] in nazi germany , there was a motivation to forbid es ##per ##anto because za ##men ##hof was jewish , and due to the international ##ist nature of es ##per ##anto , which was perceived as " bo ##ls ##he ##vis ##t " . [SEP]
[CLS] in his work , " mein kam ##pf " , adolf hitler specifically mentioned es ##per ##anto as an example of a language that could be used by an international jewish conspiracy once they achieved world domination . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##ant ##ists were killed during the holocaust , with za ##men ##hof ' s family in particular singled out for being killed . [SEP]
[CLS] the efforts of a minority of es ##per ##ant ##ists to ex ##pel jewish colleagues and align themselves with the reich were futile and es ##per ##anto was legally forbidden in 1935 . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##ant ##ists in german concentration camps taught the language to fellow prisoners , telling guards they were teaching italian , the language of one of germany ' s axis allies . [SEP]
[CLS] in imperial japan , the left - wing of the japanese es ##per ##anto movement was forbidden , but its leaders were careful enough not to give the impression to the government that the es ##per ##ant ##ists were socialist revolutionaries , which proved a successful strategy . [SEP]
[CLS] after the october revolution of 1917 , es ##per ##anto was given a measure of government support by the new workers ' states in the former russian empire and later by the soviet union government , with the soviet es ##per ##anto association being established as an officially recognized organization . [SEP]
[CLS] in his biography on joseph stalin , leon tr ##ots ##ky mentions that stalin had studied es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in 1937 , at the height of the great purge , stalin completely reversed the soviet government ' s policies on es ##per ##anto ; many es ##per ##anto speakers were executed , exiled or held in captivity in the gu ##lag labour camps . [SEP]
[CLS] quite often the accusation was : " you are an active member of an international spy organisation which hides itself under the name of ' association of soviet es ##per ##ant ##ists ' on the territory of the soviet union . " [SEP]
[CLS] until the end of the stalin era , it was dangerous to use es ##per ##anto in the soviet union , despite the fact that it was never officially forbidden to speak es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] fascist italy allowed the use of es ##per ##anto , finding its ph ##ono ##logy similar to that of italian and publishing some tourist material in the language . [SEP]
[CLS] during and after the spanish civil war , francois ##t spain suppressed anarchist ##s , socialists and catalan nationalists for many years , among whom the use of es ##per ##anto was extensive , but in the 1950s the es ##per ##anto movement was again tolerated . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto has not been a secondary official language of any recognized country , but it entered the education system of several countries such as hungary and china . [SEP]
[CLS] there were plans at the beginning of the 20th century to establish neutral more ##s ##net as the world ' s first es ##per ##anto state . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , the self - proclaimed artificial island micro ##nation of rose island used es ##per ##anto as its official language in 1968 , and another micro ##nation , the extant republic of mo ##los ##sia , uses es ##per ##anto as an official language alongside english . [SEP]
[CLS] the chinese government has used es ##per ##anto since 2001 for daily news on china . org . cn . [SEP]
[CLS] china also uses es ##per ##anto in china radio international and for the internet magazine " el pop ##ola ci ##nio " . [SEP]
[CLS] the vatican radio has an es ##per ##anto version of its website . [SEP]
[CLS] the us army has published military phrase books in es ##per ##anto , to be used from the 1950s until the 1970s in war games by mock enemy forces . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is the working language of several non - profit international organizations such as the , a left - wing cultural association which had 72 ##4 members in over 85 countries in 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] there is also education @ internet , which has developed from an es ##per ##anto organization ; most others are specifically es ##per ##anto organizations . [SEP]
[CLS] the largest of these , the universal es ##per ##anto association , has an official consultative relationship with the united nations and unesco , which recognized es ##per ##anto as a medium for international understanding in 1954 . [SEP]
[CLS] the world es ##per ##anto association collaborated in 2017 with unesco to deliver an es ##per ##anto translation of its magazine " unesco courier " ( " une ##sko ku ##rier ##o en es ##per ##anto " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is also the first language of teaching and administration of the international academy of sciences san marino . [SEP]
[CLS] in the summer of 1924 , the american radio relay league adopted es ##per ##anto as its official international auxiliary language , and hoped that the language would be used by radio amateurs in international communications , but its actual use for radio communications was ne ##gli ##gible . [SEP]
[CLS] all the personal documents sold by the world service authority , including the world passport , are written in es ##per ##anto , together with english , french , spanish , russian , arabic , and chinese . [SEP]
[CLS] za ##men ##hof ' s goal to " enable the learn ##er to make direct use of his knowledge with persons of any nationality , whether the language be universally accepted or not " , as he wrote in 1887 , has been achieved , as the language is currently spoken by people living in more than 100 countries . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , one common criticism made is that es ##per ##anto has failed to live up to the hopes of its creator , who dreamed of it becoming a universal second language . [SEP]
[CLS] in this regard it has to be noted that za ##men ##hof was well aware that it might take much time , maybe even " many centuries " , to get this hope into reality . [SEP]
[CLS] in his speech at the world es ##per ##anto congress in cambridge in 1907 he said , " we hope that earlier or later , maybe after many centuries , on a neutral language foundation , understanding one each other , the nations will build . . . a big family circle . " [SEP]
[CLS] the es ##per ##anto alphabet is based on the latin script , using a one - sound - one - letter principle , except for d ##z . [SEP]
[CLS] it includes six letters with dia ##cr ##itic ##s : c , g , h , j , s ( with ci ##rc ##um ##fle ##x ) , and u ( with br ##eve ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the alphabet does not include the letters " q , w , x , " or " y " , which are only used when writing una ##ssi ##mi ##lated foreign terms or proper names . [SEP]
[CLS] the 28 - letter alphabet is : all una ##cc ##ented letters are pronounced approximately as in the ipa , with the exception of " c " . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto " j " and " c " are used in a way familiar to speakers of many european languages , but unfamiliar to most english speakers : " j " has a " y " sound j ~ i , as in yellow " and " boy , " and " c " has a " ts " sound ts , as in " hits or the " z ##z " in " pizza " . [SEP]
[CLS] the accent ##ed letters are a bit like " h " - dig ##raph ##s in english : " c " is pronounced like english " ch " , and " s " like " sh " . [SEP]
[CLS] " g " is the " g " in gem " , " j " a " z ##h " sound , as in " fusion " or french jacques " , and the rare " h " is like the german , scottish gaelic , scots and scottish standard english " loch , or how sc ##ouse people sometimes pro ##no ##unce the ' k ' in " book and ' ck ' in " chicken " . [SEP]
[CLS] even with the widespread adoption of unicode , the letters with dia ##cr ##itic ##s ( found in the " latin - extended a " section of the unicode standard ) can cause problems with printing and computing , because they are not found on most physical keyboards and are left out of certain font ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] there are two principal work ##around ##s to this problem , which substitute dig ##raph ##s for the accent ##ed letters . [SEP]
[CLS] za ##men ##hof , the inventor of es ##per ##anto , created an " h - convention " , which replaces " c , g , h , j , s , " and " u " with " ch , g ##h , h ##h , j ##h , sh , " and " u , " respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] if used in a database , a program in principle could not determine whether to render , for example , " ch " as " c " followed by " h " or as " c " , and would fail to render , for example , the word properly . [SEP]
[CLS] a more recent " x - convention " has gained ground since the advent of computing . [SEP]
[CLS] this system replaces each dia ##cr ##itic with an " x " ( not part of the es ##per ##anto alphabet ) after the letter , producing the six dig ##raph ##s " c ##x , g ##x , h ##x , j ##x , s ##x , " and " u ##x " . [SEP]
[CLS] there are computer keyboard layout ##s that support the es ##per ##anto alphabet , and some systems use software that automatically replaces x - or h - convention dig ##raph ##s with the corresponding dia ##cr ##itic letters ( for example , for microsoft windows , mac os x , and linux , for windows phone , and gb ##oa ##rd and any ##so ##ft ##key ##board for android ) . [SEP]
[CLS] criticisms are made of the letters with ci ##rc ##um ##fle ##x dia ##cr ##itic ##s , which some find odd or cum ##bers ##ome , along with their being invented specifically for es ##per ##anto rather than borrowed from existing languages ; as well as being arguably unnecessary , as for example with the use of " h " instead of " x " and " u " instead of " w " . [SEP]
[CLS] the ph ##ono ##logy , grammar , vocabulary , and semantics are based on the indo - european languages spoken in europe . [SEP]
[CLS] the sound inventory is essentially slavic , as is much of the semantics , whereas the vocabulary derives primarily from the romance languages , with a lesser contribution from germanic languages and minor contributions from slavic languages and greek . [SEP]
[CLS] pr ##ag ##matic ##s and other aspects of the language not specified by za ##men ##hof ' s original documents were influenced by the native languages of early authors , primarily russian , polish , german , and french . [SEP]
[CLS] paul we ##x ##ler proposes that es ##per ##anto is re ##le ##xi ##fied yiddish , which he claims is in turn a re ##le ##xi ##fied slavic language , though this model is not accepted by mainstream academics . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto has been described as " a language lexi ##cal ##ly predominantly romani ##c , morphological ##ly intensive ##ly ag ##gl ##uti ##nat ##ive , and to a certain degree iso ##lating in character " . [SEP]
[CLS] ty ##pol ##ogical ##ly , es ##per ##anto has prep ##osition ##s and a pr ##ag ##matic word order that by default is " subject – verb – object . " [SEP]
[CLS] adjective ##s can be freely placed before or after the nouns they modify , though placing them before the noun is more common . [SEP]
[CLS] new words are formed through extensive prefix ##ing and suffix ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto words are mostly derived by string ##ing together roots , grammatical endings , and at times prefix ##es and suffix ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] this process is regular , so that people can create new words as they speak and be understood . [SEP]
[CLS] compound words are formed with a mod ##ifier - first , head - final order , as in english ( compare " birds ##ong " and " song ##bird , " and likewise , and ) . [SEP]
[CLS] speakers may optional ##ly insert an " o " between the words in a compound noun if placing them together directly without the " o " would make the resulting word hard to say or understand . [SEP]
[CLS] the different parts of speech are marked by their own suffix ##es : all common nouns end in , all adjective ##s in , all derived ad ##ver ##bs in , and all verbs except the ju ##ssi ##ve ( or imperative ) end in , specifically in one of six tense and mood suffix ##es , such as the present tense ; the ju ##ssi ##ve mood , which is tense ##less , ends in . [SEP]
[CLS] nouns and adjective ##s have two cases : no ##mina ##tive for grammatical subjects and in general , and acc ##usa ##tive for direct objects and ( after a prep ##osition ) to indicate direction of movement . [SEP]
[CLS] singular nouns used as grammatical subjects end in , plural subject nouns in ( pronounced o ##i like english " o ##y " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] singular direct object forms end in , and plural direct objects with the combination ( o ##in ; rhymes with " coin " ) : indicates that the word is a noun , indicates the plural , and indicates the acc ##usa ##tive ( direct object ) case . [SEP]
[CLS] adjective ##s agree with their nouns ; their endings are singular subject ( a ; rhymes with " ha ! " ) , [SEP]
[CLS] , plural subject ( ai , pronounced " eye " ) , singular object , and plural object ( ain ; rhymes with " fine " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the suffix , besides indicating the direct object , is used to indicate movement and a few other things as well . [SEP]
[CLS] the six verb in ##fle ##ctions consist of three tense ##s and three moods . [SEP]
[CLS] they are present tense , future tense , past tense , in ##fin ##itive mood , conditional mood and ju ##ssi ##ve mood ( used for wishes and commands ) . [SEP]
[CLS] verbs are not marked for person or number . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , means " to sing " , means " i sing " , means " you sing " , and means " they sing " . [SEP]
[CLS] word order is comparatively free . [SEP]
[CLS] adjective ##s may pre ##cede or follow nouns ; subjects , verbs and objects may occur in any order . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the article " the " , demons ##tra ##tive ##s such as " that " and prep ##osition ##s ( such as " at " ) must come before their related nouns . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , the negative " not " and conjunction ##s such as " and " and " that " must pre ##cede the phrase or clause that they introduce . [SEP]
[CLS] in cop ##ular ( a = b ) clauses , word order is just as important as in english : " people are animals " is distinguished from " animals are people " . [SEP]
[CLS] the hungarian academy of sciences has found that es ##per ##anto fulfill ##s all the requirements of a living language . [SEP]
[CLS] the vocabulary , or ##th ##ography , ph ##ono ##logy , and semantics , are all thoroughly european . [SEP]
[CLS] the vocabulary , for example , draws about two - thirds from romance and one - third from germanic languages ; the syntax is romance ; and the ph ##ono ##logy and semantics are slavic . [SEP]
[CLS] the grammar is arguably more european than not , but claude pi ##ron among others argues that the derivation system is not particularly european , though the in ##fle ##ction is . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is frequently accused of being inherently sex ##ist , because the default form of some nouns is masculine while a derived form is used for the feminine , which is said to retain traces of the male - dominated society of late 19th - century europe of which es ##per ##anto is a product . [SEP]
[CLS] these nouns are primarily titles and kin terms , such as " sin ##jo ##ro " " mr , sir " vs . " sin ##jo ##rino " " ms , lady " and " pat ##ro " " father " vs . " pat ##rino " " mother " . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , nouns that denote persons and whose definitions are not explicitly male are often assumed to be male unless explicitly made female , such as " do ##kt ##oro , " a phd doctor ( male or unspecified ) versus " do ##kt ##orin ##o , " a female phd . [SEP]
[CLS] this is analogous to the situation with the english suffix " - es ##s , " as in the words " baron / baroness " , " waiter / waitress " , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto pronouns are similar . [SEP]
[CLS] as in english , " li " " he " may be used generic ##ally , whereas " si " " she " is always female . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto typically has 22 to 24 consonants , depending on the phone ##mic analysis and individual speaker , five vowels , and two semi ##vo ##we ##ls that combine with the vowels to form six dip ##ht ##hong ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ( the consonant / j / and semi ##vo ##we ##l / i / are both written " j " , and the uncommon consonant / d ##z / is written with the dig ##raph " d ##z " , which is the only consonant that doesn ' t have its own letter . ) [SEP]
[CLS] tone is not used to distinguish meanings of words . [SEP]
[CLS] stress is always on the second - last vowel in fully es ##per ##anto words unless a final vowel is eli ##ded , which occurs mostly in poetry . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , " " " family " is fa . mi . ˈ ##li . o , with the stress on the second " i " , but when the word is used without the final " , " the stress remains on the second : fa . mi . ˈ ##li . [SEP]
[CLS] the sound is usually an al ##ve ##olar tri ##ll , but can also be a uv ##ular tri ##ll , a uv ##ular fr ##icative , and an al ##ve ##olar approx ##iman ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] many other forms such an al ##ve ##olar tap are done and accepted in practice . [SEP]
[CLS] the is normally pronounced like english " v , " but may be pronounced ( between english " v " and " w " ) or , depending on the language background of the speaker . [SEP]
[CLS] a semi ##vo ##we ##l / u / normally occurs only in dip ##ht ##hong ##s after the vowels and , not as a consonant / w / . [SEP]
[CLS] common , if debated , assimilation includes the pronunciation of as ŋ ##k and as ɡ ##z . [SEP]
[CLS] a large number of consonant clusters can occur , up to three in initial position ( as in ' , " strange " ) and four in medial position ( as in ' , " teach " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] final clusters are uncommon except in foreign names , poetic eli ##sion of final " , " and a very few basic words such as ' " hundred " and ' " after " . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto has the five vowels found in such languages as classical latin , japanese , spanish , sw ##ah ##ili , modern hebrew , and modern greek . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also two semi ##vo ##we ##ls , / i / and / u / , which combine with the mono ##ph ##th ##ong ##s to form six falling dip ##ht ##hong ##s : " , , , , , " and . [SEP]
[CLS] since there are only five vowels , a good deal of variation in pronunciation is tolerated . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , " e " commonly ranges from e ( french ) to ɛ ( french ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these details often depend on the speaker ' s native language . [SEP]
[CLS] a g ##lot ##tal stop may occur between adjacent vowels in some people ' s speech , especially when the two vowels are the same , as in ' " hero " ( he . ˈ ##ro . o or he . ˈ ##ro . ʔ ##o ) and ' " great - grandfather " ( pr ##a . ˈ ##a . vo or pr ##a . ˈ ##ʔ ##a . vo ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the following short extract gives an idea of the character of es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] ( pronunciation is covered above ; the es ##per ##anto letter " j " is pronounced like english " y " . ) [SEP]
[CLS] the core vocabulary of es ##per ##anto was defined by , published by za ##men ##hof in 1887 . [SEP]
[CLS] this book listed 900 roots ; these could be expanded into tens of thousands of words using prefix ##es , suffix ##es , and compound ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1894 , za ##men ##hof published the first es ##per ##anto dictionary , , which had a larger set of roots . [SEP]
[CLS] the rules of the language allowed speakers to borrow new roots as needed ; it was recommended , however , that speakers use most international forms and then derive related meanings from these . [SEP]
[CLS] since then , many words have been borrowed , primarily ( but not solely ) from the european languages . [SEP]
[CLS] not all proposed borrowing ##s become widespread , but many do , especially technical and scientific terms . [SEP]
[CLS] terms for everyday use , on the other hand , are more likely to be derived from existing roots ; " computer " , for instance , is formed from the verb " compute " and the suffix " tool " . [SEP]
[CLS] words are also cal ##que ##d ; that is , words acquire new meanings based on usage in other languages . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the word " mouse " has acquired the meaning of a computer mouse from its usage in english . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto speakers often debate about whether a particular borrowing is justified or whether meaning can be expressed by der ##iving from or extending the meaning of existing words . [SEP]
[CLS] some compounds and formed words in es ##per ##anto are not entirely straightforward ; for example , , literally " give out " , means " publish " , parallel ##ing the usage of certain european languages ( such as german ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , the suffix " - um - " has no defined meaning ; words using the suffix must be learned separately ( such as " to the right " and " clockwise " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there are not many id ##iom ##atic or slang words in es ##per ##anto , as these forms of speech tend to make international communication difficult — working against es ##per ##anto ' s main goal . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of derivation ##s of es ##per ##anto roots , new roots are taken from european languages in the endeavor to create an international language . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto speakers learn the language through self - directed study , online tutor ##ials , and correspondence courses taught by volunteers . [SEP]
[CLS] more recently , free teaching websites , like and , are available . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto instruction is rarely available at schools , including four primary schools in a pilot project under the supervision of the university of manchester , and by one count at a few universities . [SEP]
[CLS] however , outside china and hungary , these mostly involve informal arrangements rather than dedicated departments or state sponsorship . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##ot ##vos lo ##rand university in budapest had a department of inter ##ling ##uis ##tics and es ##per ##anto from 1966 to 2004 , after which time instruction moved to vocational colleges ; there are state examinations for es ##per ##anto instructors . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , adam mick ##ie ##wicz university in poland offers a diploma in inter ##ling ##uis ##tics . [SEP]
[CLS] the senate of brazil passed a bill in 2009 that would make es ##per ##anto an optional part of the curriculum in public schools , although mandatory if there is demand for it . [SEP]
[CLS] s of 2015 the bill is still under consideration by the chamber of deputies . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , es ##per ##anto is notably offered as a weekly evening course at stanford university ' s be ##cht ##el international center . [SEP]
[CLS] conversation ##al es ##per ##anto , the international language , is a free drop - in class that is open to stanford students and the general public on campus during the academic year . [SEP]
[CLS] with administrative permission , stanford students can take the class for two credits a quarter through the linguistics department . [SEP]
[CLS] " even four lessons are enough to get more than just the basics , " the es ##per ##anto at stanford website reads . [SEP]
[CLS] after taking the es ##per ##anto course at their university and becoming fascinated with the language , two stanford students embarked on a research project travelling around europe to document the history and usage of es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] they visited formal institutions devoted to es ##per ##anto , including the es ##per ##anto museum in vienna , and participated in tours conducted in the language and distributed a survey to major es ##per ##anto organizations . [SEP]
[CLS] their research focused on the community of es ##per ##anto speakers with the hope of engaging the es ##per ##anto community and the public at large . [SEP]
[CLS] various educators have estimated that es ##per ##anto can be learned in anywhere from one quarter to one twentieth the amount of time required for other languages . [SEP]
[CLS] claude pi ##ron , an es ##per ##anto - activist and chinese – english – russian – spanish translator for the united nations , argued that es ##per ##anto is far more intuitive than many ethnic languages : " es ##per ##anto relies entirely on innate reflex ##es and differs from all other languages in that you can always trust your natural tendency to general ##ize patterns . . . the same ne ##uro ##psy ##cho ##logical law — called by jean pia ##get " general ##izing assimilation " — applies to word formation as well as to grammar . " [SEP]
[CLS] the institute of cyber ##net ##ic pe ##da ##go ##gy at pad ##er ##born university ( germany ) has compared the length of study time it takes native ##ly french - speaking high - school students to obtain comparable ' standard ' levels in es ##per ##anto , english , german , and italian . [SEP]
[CLS] four primary schools in britain , with 230 pupils , are currently following a course in " prop ##ae ##de ##uti ##c es ##per ##anto " — that is , instruction in es ##per ##anto to raise language awareness and accelerate subsequent learning of foreign languages — under the supervision of the university of manchester . [SEP]
[CLS] as they put it , studies have been conducted in new zealand , united states , ( germany ) , italy and australia . [SEP]
[CLS] the results of these studies were favorable and demonstrated that studying es ##per ##anto before another foreign language ex ##ped ##ites the acquisition of the other , natural language . [SEP]
[CLS] this appears to be because learning subsequent foreign languages is easier than learning one ' s first foreign language , whereas the use of a grammatical ##ly simple and culturally flexible auxiliary language like es ##per ##anto less ##ens the first - language learning hurdle . [SEP]
[CLS] in one study , a group of european secondary school students studied es ##per ##anto for one year , then french for three years , and ended up with a significantly better command of french than a control group , who studied french for all four years . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is by far the most widely spoken constructed language in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] speakers are most numerous in europe and east asia , especially in urban areas , where they often form es ##per ##anto clubs . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is particularly prevalent in the northern and central countries of europe ; in china , korea , japan , and iran within asia ; in brazil , argentina , and mexico in the americas ; and in togo in africa . [SEP]
[CLS] counter ##ing a common criticism against es ##per ##anto , the stat ##istic ##ian sven ##d nielsen has found there to be no significant correlation between the number of es ##per ##anto speakers and similarity of a given national mother language to es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] he concludes that es ##per ##anto tends to be more popular in countries that are rich , with widespread internet access and that tend to contribute more to science and culture . [SEP]
[CLS] linguistic diversity within a country was found to have a slight inverse correlation with es ##per ##anto popularity . [SEP]
[CLS] an estimate of the number of es ##per ##anto speakers was made by sidney s . cu ##lbert , a retired psychology professor at the university of washington and a longtime es ##per ##ant ##ist , who tracked down and tested es ##per ##anto speakers in sample areas in dozens of countries over a period of twenty years . [SEP]
[CLS] cu ##lbert concluded that between one and two million people speak es ##per ##anto at foreign service level 3 , " professionally proficient " ( able to communicate moderately complex ideas without hesitation , and to follow speeches , radio broadcasts , etc . ) . [SEP]
[CLS] cu ##lbert ' s estimate was not made for es ##per ##anto alone , but formed part of his listing of estimates for all languages of more than one million speakers , published annually in the world alma ##nac and book of facts . [SEP]
[CLS] cu ##lbert ' s most detailed account of his methodology is found in a 1989 letter to david wolff . [SEP]
[CLS] since cu ##lbert never published detailed intermediate results for particular countries and regions , it is difficult to independently gauge the accuracy of his results . [SEP]
[CLS] in the alma ##nac , his estimates for numbers of language speakers were rounded to the nearest million , thus the number for es ##per ##anto speakers is shown as two million . [SEP]
[CLS] this latter figure appears in " et ##hn ##olo ##gue " . [SEP]
[CLS] assuming that this figure is accurate , that means that about 0 . 03 % of the world ' s population speak the language . [SEP]
[CLS] although it is not za ##men ##hof ' s goal of a universal language , it still represents a level of popularity un ##mat ##ched by any other constructed language . [SEP]
[CLS] marcus si ##kos ##ek ( now z ##iko van di ##jk ) has challenged this figure of 1 . 6 million as exaggerated . [SEP]
[CLS] he estimated that even if es ##per ##anto speakers were evenly distributed , assuming one million es ##per ##anto speakers worldwide would lead one to expect about 180 in the city of cologne . [SEP]
[CLS] van di ##jk finds only 30 fluent speakers in that city , and similarly smaller - than - expected figures in several other places thought to have a larger - than - average concentration of es ##per ##anto speakers . [SEP]
[CLS] he also notes that there are a total of about 20 , 000 members of the various es ##per ##anto organizations ( other estimates are higher ) . [SEP]
[CLS] though there are undoubtedly many es ##per ##anto speakers who are not members of any es ##per ##anto organization , he thinks it unlikely that there are fifty times more speakers than organization members . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2017 , doctoral student sven ##d nielsen estimated around 63 , 000 es ##per ##anto speakers worldwide , taking into account association membership ##s , user - generated data from es ##per ##anto websites and census statistics . [SEP]
[CLS] this number , however , was disputed by stat ##istic ##ian ste ##n johansson , who questioned the reliability of the source data and highlighted a wide margin of error , the latter point with which nielsen agrees . [SEP]
[CLS] both have stated , however , that this new number is likely more realistic than some earlier projections . [SEP]
[CLS] in the absence of dr . cu ##lbert ' s detailed sampling data , or any other census data , it is impossible to state the number of speakers with certainty . [SEP]
[CLS] native es ##per ##anto speakers , " , " have learned the language from birth from es ##per ##anto - speaking parents . [SEP]
[CLS] this usually happens when es ##per ##anto is the chief or only common language in an international family , but sometimes occurs in a family of es ##per ##anto speakers who often use the language . [SEP]
[CLS] the 15th edition of " et ##hn ##olo ##gue " cited estimates that there were 200 to 2000 native speakers in 1996 , but these figures were removed from the 16th and 17th editions . [SEP]
[CLS] the current online version of " et ##hn ##olo ##gue " gives " l ##1 users : 1 , 000 ( co ##rse ##tti et al 2004 ) " . [SEP]
[CLS] as of 1996 , there were approximately 350 attested cases of families with native es ##per ##anto speakers ( which means there were around 700 es ##per ##anto speaking natives in these families , not calculating older native speakers ) . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##ant ##ists can access an international culture , including a large body of original as well as translated literature . [SEP]
[CLS] there are more than 25 , 000 es ##per ##anto books , both originals and translations , as well as several regularly distributed es ##per ##anto magazines . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2013 a museum about es ##per ##anto opened in china . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##ant ##ists use the language for free accommodations with es ##per ##ant ##ists in 92 countries using the or to develop pen pal ##s through " " . [SEP]
[CLS] every year , es ##per ##ant ##ists meet for the world congress of es ##per ##anto " " . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , much es ##per ##anto music , such as , has been in various folk traditions . [SEP]
[CLS] there is also a variety of classical and semi - classical choral music , both original and translated , as well as large ensemble music that includes voices singing es ##per ##anto texts . [SEP]
[CLS] lou harrison , who incorporated styles and instruments from many world cultures in his music , used es ##per ##anto titles and / or texts in several of his works , most notably ( 1973 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] david gaines used es ##per ##anto poems as well as an excerpt from a speech by dr . za ##men ##hof for his " symphony no . [SEP]
[CLS] one ( es ##per ##anto ) " for me ##zzo - soprano and orchestra ( 1994 – 98 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote original es ##per ##anto text for his ( " i can cry no longer " ) for una ##cco ##mp ##ani ##ed sat ##b choir ( 1994 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also shared traditions , such as za ##men ##hof day , and shared behaviour patterns . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##ant ##ists speak primarily in es ##per ##anto at international es ##per ##anto meetings . [SEP]
[CLS] det ##rac ##tors of es ##per ##anto occasionally critic ##ize it as " having no culture " . [SEP]
[CLS] proponents , such as prof . humphrey ton ##kin of the university of hartford , observe that es ##per ##anto is " culturally neutral by design , as it was intended to be a fa ##ci ##lita ##tor between cultures , not to be the carrier of any one national culture " . [SEP]
[CLS] the late scottish es ##per ##anto author william au ##ld wrote extensively on the subject , arguing that es ##per ##anto is " the expression of a common human culture , une ##nc ##umber ##ed by national frontiers . [SEP]
[CLS] thus it is considered a culture on its own . " [SEP]
[CLS] a number of es ##per ##anto associations also advance education in and about the international language es ##per ##anto and aim to preserve and promote the culture and heritage of es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] poland added es ##per ##anto to its list of int ##ang ##ible heritage in 2014 . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto has been used in a number of films and novels . [SEP]
[CLS] typically , this is done either to add the exotic flavour of a foreign language without representing any particular ethnicity , or to avoid going to the trouble of in ##venting a new language . [SEP]
[CLS] the charlie chaplin film " the great dictator " ( 1940 ) showed jewish ghetto shop signs in es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] two full - length feature films have been produced with dialogue entirely in es ##per ##anto : " , " in 1964 , and " inc ##ub ##us , " a 1965 b - movie horror film which is also notable for starring william sha ##tner shortly before he began working on " " . [SEP]
[CLS] in captain fantastic ( 2016 ) there is a dialogue in es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , film director alfonso cu ##aro ##n has publicly shown his fascination for es ##per ##anto and called his production company es ##per ##anto film ##oj ( " es ##per ##anto movies " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a language school teaching " en ##tre ##nation ##o " ( representing a satire on es ##per ##anto ) is featured in graham greene ' s novel " the confidential agent " , which was made into a film starring charles boyer and lauren ba ##cal ##l ( 1945 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] other amateur productions have been made , such as a drama ##ti ##zation of the novel ( ge ##rda has disappeared ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in " st ##am ##bo ##ul train " , greene used es ##per ##anto as the language on signs at the main train station in budapest . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of mainstream films in national languages have used es ##per ##anto in some way . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is used as the universal language in the far future of harry harrison ' s " stainless steel rat " and " death ##world " stories . [SEP]
[CLS] po ##ul anderson ' s story " high treason " takes place in a future where earth became united politically but was still divided into many languages and cultures , and es ##per ##anto became the language of its space armed forces , fighting wars with various extra ##ter ##rest ##rial races . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is said to be the official language of all the peoples of philip jose farmer ' s " river ##world " series . [SEP]
[CLS] the opening song to the popular video game " final fantasy xi " , " " , was written in es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the first game in the series that was played online , and would have players from both japan and north america ( official european support was added after the north american launch ) playing together on the same servers , using an auto - translate tool to communicate . [SEP]
[CLS] the composer , no ##bu ##o u ##ema ##tsu , felt that es ##per ##anto was a good language to symbol ##ize worldwide unity . [SEP]
[CLS] in the geek fiction novel " off to be the wizard " , es ##per ##anto is programmed as the language that triggers all of the wizard ' s spells . [SEP]
[CLS] a teacher explains that this is because " no one really speaks es ##per ##anto and it ' s easy to learn " . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is found in the image comics series " saga " as the language blue , spoken by the horned inhabitants of wreath . [SEP]
[CLS] it is rendered in blue - colored text . [SEP]
[CLS] blue is generally only spoken by inhabitants of wreath , while most other cultures use a universal language that appears to be simply named " language . " [SEP]
[CLS] some wreath inhabitants use translator rings to communicate with those who don ' t speak blue . [SEP]
[CLS] magic seems to be activated via the linguistic medium of blue . [SEP]
[CLS] in the television show " red dwarf " , which begins in the late 22nd century , crew ##man arnold rim ##mer constantly spends his time trying to learn es ##per ##anto and failing , even compared to his bunk ##mate dave lister who only maintains a casual interest . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally many of the signs around the ship " red dwarf " are written in both english and es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] the novel " infinity welcome ##s careful drivers " states that , although not required , it is widely expected that officers in the space corps be fluent in the language , hence rim ##mer ' s interest . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is available in the language selection in the video game " mine ##craft " . [SEP]
[CLS] in season 1 , episode 15 of nickelodeon ' s " danny phantom " the werewolf - type creature , wu ##lf , speaks in es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 2010 animated film " " super ##girl is heard speaking es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] it is never referred to as es ##per ##anto , and serves as a proxy for the language of k ##ry ##pton . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1921 the french academy of sciences recommended using es ##per ##anto for international scientific communication . [SEP]
[CLS] a few scientists and mathematicians , such as maurice fr ##eche ##t ( mathematics ) , john c . wells ( linguistics ) , helm ##ar frank ( pe ##da ##go ##gy and cyber ##net ##ics ) , and nobel laureate rein ##hard se ##lten ( economics ) have published part of their work in es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] frank and se ##lten were among the founders of the international academy of sciences in san marino , sometimes called the " es ##per ##anto university " , where es ##per ##anto is the primary language of teaching and administration . [SEP]
[CLS] a message in es ##per ##anto was recorded and included in " voyager 1 " ' s golden record . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto business groups have been active for many years . [SEP]
[CLS] the french chamber of commerce did research in the 1920s and reported in " the new york times " in 1921 that es ##per ##anto seemed to be the best business language . [SEP]
[CLS] za ##men ##hof had three goals , as he wrote already in 1887 : to create an easy language , to create a language ready to use " whether the language be universally accepted or not " and to find some means to get many people learn the language . [SEP]
[CLS] so za ##men ##hof ' s intention was not only to create an easy - to - learn language to foster peace and international understanding as a general language , but also to create a language for immediate use by a ( small ) language community . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto was to serve as an international auxiliary language , that is , as a universal second language , not to replace ethnic languages . [SEP]
[CLS] this goal was widely shared among es ##per ##anto speakers in the early decades of the movement . [SEP]
[CLS] later , es ##per ##anto speakers began to see the language and the culture that had grown up around it as ends in themselves , even if es ##per ##anto is never adopted by the united nations or other international organizations . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto speakers who want to see es ##per ##anto adopted officially or on a large scale worldwide are commonly called , from , meaning " final victory " . [SEP]
[CLS] it has to be noted that there are two kinds of " fin ##ven ##kis ##mo " – " des ##ub ##ism ##o " and " des ##up ##ris ##mo " ; the first aims to spread es ##per ##anto between ordinary people ( " des ##ub ##e " , from below ) aiming to form a steadily growing community of es ##per ##anto speakers . [SEP]
[CLS] the second aims to act from above ( " des ##up ##re " ) , beginning with politicians . [SEP]
[CLS] za ##men ##hof considered the first way to have a better perspective , as " for such affairs as ours , governments come with their approval and help usually only , when everything is already completely finished " . [SEP]
[CLS] those who focus on the intrinsic value of the language are commonly called , from ra ##uma , finland , where a declaration on the short - term imp ##ro ##ba ##bility of the and the value of es ##per ##anto culture was made at the international youth congress in 1980 . [SEP]
[CLS] however the " manifesto de ra ##um ##o " clearly mentions the intention to further spread the language : " we want to spread es ##per ##anto to put into effect its positive values more and more , step by step " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1996 the prague manifesto was adopted at the annual congress of the world es ##per ##anto association ( u ##ea ) ; it was sub ##scribe ##d by individual participants and later by other es ##per ##anto speakers . [SEP]
[CLS] more recently , language - learning apps like duo ##ling ##o and ami ##ku ##mu have helped to increase the amount of fluent speakers of es ##per ##anto , and find others in their area to speak the language with . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest flag , and the one most commonly used today , features a green five - pointed star against a white canton , upon a field of green . [SEP]
[CLS] it was proposed to za ##men ##hof by richard geo ##gh ##egan , author of the first es ##per ##anto textbook for english speakers , in 1887 . [SEP]
[CLS] the flag was approved in 1905 by delegates to the first conference of es ##per ##ant ##ists at bo ##ulo ##gne - sur - mer . [SEP]
[CLS] a version with an " " super ##im ##posed over the green star is sometimes seen . [SEP]
[CLS] other variants include that for christian es ##per ##ant ##ists , with a white christian cross super ##im ##posed upon the green star , and that for leftist ##s , with the color of the field changed from green to red . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1987 , a second flag design was chosen in a contest organized by the u ##ea celebrating the first centennial of the language . [SEP]
[CLS] it featured a white background with two st ##yl ##ised curved " e " s facing each other . [SEP]
[CLS] dubbed the " " ( jubilee symbol ) , it attracted criticism from some es ##per ##ant ##ists , who dubbed it the " " ( mel ##on ) because of the design ' s elliptical shape . [SEP]
[CLS] it is still in use , though to a lesser degree than the traditional symbol , known as the " " ( green star ) . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto has been placed in many proposed political situations . [SEP]
[CLS] the most popular of these is the europe – democracy – es ##per ##anto , which aims to establish es ##per ##anto as the official language of the european union . [SEP]
[CLS] grin ' s report , published in 2005 by francois grin , found that the use of english as the ling ##ua fran ##ca within the european union costs billions annually and significantly benefits english - speaking countries financially . [SEP]
[CLS] the report considered a scenario where es ##per ##anto would be the ling ##ua fran ##ca , and found that it would have many advantages , particularly economically speaking , as well as ideological ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] russian es ##per ##anto writer nikolai ne ##kra ##sov was arrested during the stalin ##ist repression ##s of the late 1930s , accused of being " an organizer and leader of a fascist , espionage , terrorist organization of es ##per ##ant ##ists " , and executed on october 4 , 1938 . [SEP]
[CLS] another es ##per ##anto writer vladimir var ##an ##kin was executed on october 3 , 1938 . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto has served an important role in several religions , such as o ##omo ##to from japan and the baha ' i faith from iran , and has been encouraged by others , like some spirit ##ist movements . [SEP]
[CLS] the o ##omo ##to religion encourages the use of es ##per ##anto among its followers and includes za ##men ##hof as one of its dei ##fied spirits . [SEP]
[CLS] the baha ' i faith encourages the use of an auxiliary international language . [SEP]
[CLS] ` abd ##u ' l - baha praised the ideal of es ##per ##anto , and there was an affinity between es ##per ##ant ##ists and baha ' is during the late 19th century and early 20th century . [SEP]
[CLS] on february 12 , 1913 , ` abd ##u ' l - baha gave a talk to the paris es ##per ##anto society , [SEP]
[CLS] now , praise be to god that dr . za ##men ##hof has invented the es ##per ##anto language . [SEP]
[CLS] it has all the potential qualities of becoming the international means of communication . [SEP]
[CLS] all of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort ; for in this way he has served his fellow ##men well . [SEP]
[CLS] with un ##ti ##ring effort and self - sacrifice on the part of its devotees es ##per ##anto will become universal . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition , be accepted by all nations and governments of the world , and become a part of the curriculum in all the public schools . [SEP]
[CLS] i hope that es ##per ##anto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses , so that all people need acquire only two languages — one their own tongue and the other the international language . [SEP]
[CLS] then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world . [SEP]
[CLS] consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations . [SEP]
[CLS] if one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore i hope that you will make the utmost effort , so that this language of es ##per ##anto may be widely spread [SEP]
[CLS] lid ##ia za ##men ##hof , daughter of l . l . za ##men ##hof , became a baha ' i around 1925 . [SEP]

[CLS] at the request of ' abd ##u ’ l - baha , agnes baldwin alexander became an early advocate of es ##per ##anto and used it to spread the baha ’ i teachings at meetings and conferences in japan . [SEP]
[CLS] today there exists an active sub - community of baha ' i es ##per ##ant ##ists and various volumes of baha ' i literature have been translated into es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1973 , the baha ' i es ##per ##anto - league for active baha ' i supporters of es ##per ##anto was founded . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1908 , spirit ##ist cam ##ilo cha ##ign ##eau wrote an article named " spirit ##ism and es ##per ##anto " in the periodic " la vie d ' out ##re - tomb ##e " recommend ##ing the use of es ##per ##anto in a " central magazine " for all spirit ##ists and es ##per ##ant ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto then became actively promoted by spirit ##ists , at least in brazil , initially by is ##ma ##el go ##mes bra ##ga and fran ##tis ##ek loren ##z ; the latter is known in brazil as francisco val ##dom ##iro loren ##z , and was a pioneer of both spirit ##ist and es ##per ##ant ##ist movements in this country . [SEP]
[CLS] the brazilian spirit ##ist federation publishes es ##per ##anto course ##books , translations of spirit ##ism ' s basic books , and encourages spirit ##ists to become es ##per ##ant ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] the first translation of the bible into es ##per ##anto was a translation of the tan ##akh or old testament done by l . l . za ##men ##hof . [SEP]
[CLS] the translation was reviewed and compared with other languages ' translations by a group of british clergy and scholars before its publication at the british and foreign bible society in 1910 . [SEP]
