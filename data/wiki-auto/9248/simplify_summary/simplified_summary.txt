in 1905 , zamenhof published " fundamento de esperanto " as a definitive guide to the language .
later that year , he organized the first world esperanto congress , an ongoing conference , in boulogne-sur-mer , france .
one of its pronouncements is that " fundamento de esperanto " is the only obligatory authority over the language .

esperanto was created in the late 1870s and early 1880s by l . l . zamenhof , a polish-jewish ophthalmologist from białystok , then part of the russian empire but now part of poland .
he created the language to reduce the " time and labour we spend in learning foreign tongues " and to foster harmony between people from different countries .
the goal for esperanto to become a general world language was not the only goal of zamenhof .
the number of speakers grew rapidly over the next few decades , at first primarily in the russian empire and central europe , then in other parts of europe , the americas , china , and japan .
in the early years , speakers of esperanto kept in contact mainly through correspondence and periodicals .
since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year , except during the two world wars .
the territory of neutral moresnet , between belgium and germany , had a sizable proportion of esperanto-speakers among its small and multi-ethnic population .

anarchism as a political movement was very supportive during this time of anationalism as well as of the esperanto language .
the situation was especially pronounced in nazi germany , francoist spain up until the 1950s , and in the soviet union from 1937 to 1956 .
in nazi germany , there was a reason to forbid esperanto because zamenhof was jewish .
esperanto was an example of esperanto as an example of a language that could be used by an international jewish conspiracy once they achieved world domination .
in imperial japan , the left-wing of the japanese esperanto movement was forbidden , but its leaders were careful enough not to give the impression to the government that the esperantists were socialist revolutionaries , which proved a successful strategy .

in 1937 , at the height of the great purge , stalin reversed the soviet government 's policies on esperanto ; many esperanto speakers were executed , exiled or held in captivity in the gulag labor camps .
quite often the accusation was : " you are an active member of an international spy organisation which hides itself under the name of ' association of soviet esperantists ' on the territory of the soviet union . "
until the end of the stalin era , it was dangerous to use esperanto in the soviet union .
esperanto has not been a secondary official language of any recognized country , but it entered the education system of several countries such as hungary and china .
at the beginning of the 20th century , moresnet was the first country in the world to be neutral .

zamenhof 's goal to " enable the learner to make direct use of his knowledge with persons of any nationality , whether the language is universally accepted or not " , as he wrote in 1887 , as the language is currently spoken by people living in more than 100 countries .
some people say that esperanto was not a universal second language .
in this regard it has to be noted that zamenhof was well aware that it might take much time , maybe even " many centuries " , to get this hope into reality .
in his speech at the world esperanto congress in cambridge in 1907 he said , " we hope that earlier or later , maybe after many centuries , on a neutral language foundation , understanding one each other , the nations will build . . a big family circle . "
the 28-letter alphabet is written using all letters that are pronounced as in the ipa , with the exception of " c " .
esperanto " j " and " c " are used in a way familiar to speakers of many european languages .
even with the widespread adoption of unicode , the letters with diacritics can cause problems with printing and computing , because they are not found on most physical keyboards and are left out of certain fonts .
if used in a database , a program in principle could not decide whether to render , for example , " c " followed by " h " or as " c " , and would fail to render , for example , the word properly .
a more recent " x-convention " has gained popularity since the advent of computing .
some of the letters with circumflex diacritics , which some find odd or cumbersome , are now invented specifically for esperanto .
the phonology , grammar , vocabulary , and semantics are based on the indo-european languages spoken in europe .
the sound inventory is essentially slavic , whereas the vocabulary is based mostly from romance languages , with a lesser contribution from germanic languages and minor contributions from slavic languages and greek .
the language was influenced by russian , polish , german , and french .
paul wexler proposes that esperanto is relexified yiddish , which he claims is in turn a relexified slavic language .
esperanto has been described as " a language lexically predominantly romanic , morphologically agglutinative , and to a certain degree isolating in character . "
esperanto words are mostly derived by stringing together roots , grammatical endings , and at times prefixes and suffixes .
when placing them together without the " o " it would make the resulting word hard to say or understand .
the different parts of speech are marked by their own suffixes : all common nouns end in , all adjectives in , all derived adverbs in , and all verbs except the jussiveaux end in , and all verbs except the imperative ending in , in one of the six tense and mood suffixes , such as the present tense , which ends in the jussive mood .
the suffix , besides indicating the direct object , is used to indicate movement and a few other things as well .
they are present tense , future tense , past tense , conditional mood and jussive mooditions used for wishes and commands .
however , the article " the " , demonstratives such as " that " and prepositionsrford such as " at " ⟩ must come before their related nouns .
similarly , the negative " not " and conjunctions such as " and " that " must precede the phrase or clause that they introduce .
in copularoat a = braphy clauses , word order is just as important as in english : " people are animals " is distinguished from " animals are people " .
the vocabulary , for example , draws about two-thirds from romance and one-third from germanic languages ; the syntax is romance ; and the phonology and semantics are slavic .
esperanto is often accused of being inherently sexist , because the default form of some nouns is masculine .
many other forms such an alveolar tap are done and accepted in practice .

final clusters are uncommon except in foreign names , poetic elision of final " , " and a very few basic words such as ' hundred ' and ' after ' .
esperanto has the five vowels in such languages as classical latin , japanese , swahili , modern hebrew , and modern greek .
there are five vowels , but a good deal of variation in pronunciation is tolerated .
the following short extract gives an idea of esperanto .
the esperanto letter " j " is pronounced like english " y " .
since then , many words have been borrowed , primarily heller heller but not solely onod from the european languages .
not all proposed borrowings become widespread , but many do , especially technical and scientific terms .
terms for everyday use , on the other hand , are more likely to be derived from existing roots ; " computer " , for instance , is formed from the verb " compute " and the suffix " tool " .
words are also calqued ; that is , words get new meanings based on usage in other languages .
for example , the word " mouse " has got the meaning of a computer mouse from its usage in english .
there are not many idiomatic or slang words in esperanto , as these forms of speech are difficult to make international communication difficult .
outside china and hungary , these mostly involve informal arrangements rather than dedicated departments or state sponsorship .

sidney s . culbert , a retired psychology professor at the university of washington and a longtime esperantist , who tracked down and tested esperanto speakers in dozens of countries over a period of twenty years .
culbert concluded that between one and two million people speak esperanto at foreign service level 3 , " professionally proficient " sipping able to communicate moderately complex ideas without hesitation , and to follow speeches , radio broadcasts , etc .
culbert 's estimate was not made for esperanto alone , but formed part of his listing of estimates for all languages of more than one million speakers , published annually in the world almanac and book of facts .
since culbert never published detailed intermediate results for particular countries and regions , it is difficult to independently gauge the accuracy of his results .
in the almanac , his estimates for numbers of language speakers were rounded to the nearest million , thus the number for esperanto speakers is shown as two million .
although it is not zamenhof 's goal of a universal language , it still represents a level of popularity unmatched by any other constructed language .
he estimated that even if esperanto speakers were evenly distributed , assuming one million esperanto speakers worldwide would lead one to expect about 180 in the city of cologne .
he thinks it unlikely that there are fifty times more speakers than organization members .
this number was disputed by statistician sten johansson , who questioned the reliability of the source data and highlighted a wide margin of error .
both have said , however , that this new number is likely more realistic than some earlier projections .
in the absence of dr . culbert 's detailed sampling data , or any other census data , it is impossible to state the number of speakers with certainty .
there are more than 25,000 esperanto books , both originals and translations , as well as several regularly distributed esperanto magazines .
