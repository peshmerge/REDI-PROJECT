the suffix , besides indicating the direct object , is used to indicate movement and a few other things as well .
they are present tense , future tense , past tense , conditional mood and jussive mooditions used for wishes and commands .

words are also calqued ; that is , words get new meanings based on usage in other languages .

culbert 's estimate was not made for esperanto alone , but formed part of his listing of estimates for all languages of more than one million speakers , published annually in the world almanac and book of facts .
since culbert never published detailed intermediate results for particular countries and regions , it is difficult to independently gauge the accuracy of his results .
