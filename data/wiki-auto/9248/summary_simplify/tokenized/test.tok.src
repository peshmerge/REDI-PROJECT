[CLS] za ##men ##hof ' s goal was to create an easy and flexible language that would serve as a universal second language to foster peace and international understanding , and to build a community of speakers , as he correctly in ##fer ##red that one could not have a language without a community of speakers . [SEP]
[CLS] his original title for the language was simply the international language ( " ling ##vo intern ##ac ##ia " ) , but early speakers grew fond of the name " es ##per ##anto " and began to use it as the name for the language in 1889 ; the name quickly gained prominence and has been used as an official name ever since . [SEP]
[CLS] the first congress ratified the declaration of bo ##ulo ##gne , which established several foundation ##al premises for the es ##per ##anto movement . [SEP]
[CLS] one of its pro ##no ##unce ##ments is that " fund ##ament ##o de es ##per ##anto " is the only obligatory authority over the language . [SEP]
[CLS] another is that the es ##per ##anto movement is exclusively a linguistic movement and that no further meaning can ever be ascribed to it . [SEP]
[CLS] za ##men ##hof also proposed to the first congress that an independent body of linguistic scholars should steward the future evolution of es ##per ##anto , fore ##sha ##do ##wing the founding of the aka ##de ##mi ##o de es ##per ##anto ( in part modeled after the academie francaise ) which was established soon thereafter . [SEP]
[CLS] since 1905 , congresses have been held in various countries every year , with the exceptions of years during the world wars . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1908 , a group of young es ##per ##anto speakers led by hector ho ##dler established the universal es ##per ##anto association , in order to provide a central organization for the global es ##per ##anto community . [SEP]
[CLS] despite speakers facing persecution in regimes such as nazi germany and the soviet union under stalin , es ##per ##anto speakers continued to establish organizations and publish periodicals tailored to specific regions and interests . [SEP]
[CLS] several writers have contributed to the growing body of es ##per ##anto literature , including william au ##ld , who received the first nomination for the nobel prize in literature for a literary work in es ##per ##anto in 1999 , followed by two more in 2004 and 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] the advent of the internet has had a significant impact on the language , as learning it has become increasingly accessible on platforms such as duo ##ling ##o and as speakers have increasingly network ##ed on platforms such as ami ##ku ##mu . [SEP]
[CLS] with approximately two ##mill ##ion speakers , a small portion of whom are native speakers , it is the most widely spoken constructed language in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] although no country has adopted es ##per ##anto officially , es ##per ##ant ##uj ##o is the collective name given to places where it is spoken , and the language is widely employed in world travel , correspondence , cultural exchange , conventions , literature , language instruction , television and radio broadcasting . [SEP]
[CLS] while its advocates continue to hope for the day that es ##per ##anto becomes officially recognized as the international auxiliary language , an increasing number have stopped focusing on this goal and instead view the es ##per ##anto community as a " state ##less dia ##sp ##oric linguistic minority " based on freedom of association , with a culture worthy of preservation based on its own merit . [SEP]
[CLS] some have also chosen to learn es ##per ##anto due to its purported help in third language acquisition . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the database " et ##hn ##olo ##gue " ( published by the summer institute of linguistics ) , up to two million people worldwide , to varying degrees , speak es ##per ##anto , including about 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 native speakers who learned es ##per ##anto from birth . [SEP]
[CLS] le ##rn ##u currently has nearly 291 , 000 registered users , who are able to view the site ' s interface in their choice of 23 languages – catalan , chinese ( both " simplified " and " traditional " characters ) danish , english , es ##per ##anto , finnish , french , georgian , german , hebrew , hungarian , italian , ki ##run ##di , ki ##sw ##ah ##ili , norwegian ( " bo ##km ##al " ) , persian , portuguese , romanian , russian , serbian , slovak , swedish and ukrainian ; a further six languages — bulgarian , croatian , czech , dutch , indonesian and spanish – have at least 60 percent of the interface localized ; nine additional languages – greek , japanese , korean , lithuanian , polish , slovenian , thai , turkish and vietnamese – are in varying stages of completing the interface translation . [SEP]
[CLS] with about articles , es ##per ##anto wikipedia ( vi ##ki ##ped ##io ) is the 32nd - largest wikipedia , as measured by the number of articles , and is the largest wikipedia in a constructed language . [SEP]
[CLS] on may 28 , 2015 , the language learning platform duo ##ling ##o launched a free es ##per ##anto course for english speakers . [SEP]
[CLS] on march 25 , 2016 , when the first duo ##ling ##o es ##per ##anto course completed its beta - testing phase , that course had 350 , 000 people registered to learn es ##per ##anto through the medium of english . [SEP]
[CLS] on july 20 , 2018 , duo ##ling ##o changed from recording users cumulative ##ly ; it now reports only the number of " active learners " , i . e . , those who are currently studying , but not those who have completed the course . [SEP]
[CLS] on october 26 , 2016 , a second duo ##ling ##o es ##per ##anto course , for which the language of instruction is spanish , appeared on the same platform and currently has a further 306 , 000 students . [SEP]
[CLS] a third es ##per ##anto course , taught in brazilian portuguese , began its beta - testing phase on may 14 , 2018 , and 179 , 000 people are currently using this course to learn the international language . [SEP]
[CLS] according to za ##men ##hof , he created the language to reduce the " time and labour we spend in learning foreign tongues " and to foster harmony between people from different countries : " were there but an international language , all translations would be made into it alone . . . and all nations would be united in a common brotherhood . " [SEP]
[CLS] the goal for es ##per ##anto to become a general world language was not the only goal of za ##men ##hof ; he also wanted to " enable the learn ##er to make direct use of his knowledge with persons of any nationality , whether the language be universally accepted or not ; in other words , the language is to be directly a means of international communication . " [SEP]
[CLS] after some ten years of development , which za ##men ##hof spent translating literature into es ##per ##anto as well as writing original prose and verse , the first book of es ##per ##anto grammar was published in warsaw on july 26 , 1887 . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of speakers grew rapidly over the next few decades , at first primarily in the russian empire and central europe , then in other parts of europe , the americas , china , and japan . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early years , speakers of es ##per ##anto kept in contact primarily through correspondence and periodicals , but in 1905 the first world congress of es ##per ##anto speakers was held in bo ##ulo ##gne - sur - mer , france . [SEP]
[CLS] since then world congresses have been held in different countries every year , except during the two world wars . [SEP]
[CLS] the autonomous territory of neutral more ##s ##net , between what is today belgium and germany , had a sizable proportion of es ##per ##anto - speakers among its small and multi - ethnic population . [SEP]
[CLS] after the great war , a great opportunity seemed to arise for es ##per ##anto when the iranian delegation to the league of nations proposed that it be adopted for use in international relations , following a report by ni ##to ##be ina ##zo , an official delegate of the league of nations during the 13th world congress of es ##per ##anto in prague . [SEP]
[CLS] han ##ota ##ux did not like how the french language was losing its position as the international language and saw es ##per ##anto as a threat , effectively wielding his veto power to block the decision . [SEP]
[CLS] ana ##rch ##ism as a political movement was very supportive during this time of ana ##tion ##alis ##m as well as of the es ##per ##anto language . [SEP]
[CLS] in nazi germany , there was a motivation to forbid es ##per ##anto because za ##men ##hof was jewish , and due to the international ##ist nature of es ##per ##anto , which was perceived as " bo ##ls ##he ##vis ##t " . [SEP]
[CLS] in his work , " mein kam ##pf " , adolf hitler specifically mentioned es ##per ##anto as an example of a language that could be used by an international jewish conspiracy once they achieved world domination . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##ant ##ists were killed during the holocaust , with za ##men ##hof ' s family in particular singled out for being killed . [SEP]
[CLS] the efforts of a minority of es ##per ##ant ##ists to ex ##pel jewish colleagues and align themselves with the reich were futile and es ##per ##anto was legally forbidden in 1935 . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##ant ##ists in german concentration camps taught the language to fellow prisoners , telling guards they were teaching italian , the language of one of germany ' s axis allies . [SEP]
[CLS] in imperial japan , the left - wing of the japanese es ##per ##anto movement was forbidden , but its leaders were careful enough not to give the impression to the government that the es ##per ##ant ##ists were socialist revolutionaries , which proved a successful strategy . [SEP]
[CLS] after the october revolution of 1917 , es ##per ##anto was given a measure of government support by the new workers ' states in the former russian empire and later by the soviet union government , with the soviet es ##per ##anto association being established as an officially recognized organization . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in 1937 , at the height of the great purge , stalin completely reversed the soviet government ' s policies on es ##per ##anto ; many es ##per ##anto speakers were executed , exiled or held in captivity in the gu ##lag labour camps . [SEP]
[CLS] quite often the accusation was : " you are an active member of an international spy organisation which hides itself under the name of ' association of soviet es ##per ##ant ##ists ' on the territory of the soviet union . " [SEP]
[CLS] until the end of the stalin era , it was dangerous to use es ##per ##anto in the soviet union , despite the fact that it was never officially forbidden to speak es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] during and after the spanish civil war , francois ##t spain suppressed anarchist ##s , socialists and catalan nationalists for many years , among whom the use of es ##per ##anto was extensive , but in the 1950s the es ##per ##anto movement was again tolerated . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto has not been a secondary official language of any recognized country , but it entered the education system of several countries such as hungary and china . [SEP]
[CLS] there were plans at the beginning of the 20th century to establish neutral more ##s ##net as the world ' s first es ##per ##anto state . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , the self - proclaimed artificial island micro ##nation of rose island used es ##per ##anto as its official language in 1968 , and another micro ##nation , the extant republic of mo ##los ##sia , uses es ##per ##anto as an official language alongside english . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is the working language of several non - profit international organizations such as the , a left - wing cultural association which had 72 ##4 members in over 85 countries in 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] there is also education @ internet , which has developed from an es ##per ##anto organization ; most others are specifically es ##per ##anto organizations . [SEP]
[CLS] the largest of these , the universal es ##per ##anto association , has an official consultative relationship with the united nations and unesco , which recognized es ##per ##anto as a medium for international understanding in 1954 . [SEP]
[CLS] the world es ##per ##anto association collaborated in 2017 with unesco to deliver an es ##per ##anto translation of its magazine " unesco courier " ( " une ##sko ku ##rier ##o en es ##per ##anto " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the summer of 1924 , the american radio relay league adopted es ##per ##anto as its official international auxiliary language , and hoped that the language would be used by radio amateurs in international communications , but its actual use for radio communications was ne ##gli ##gible . [SEP]
[CLS] all the personal documents sold by the world service authority , including the world passport , are written in es ##per ##anto , together with english , french , spanish , russian , arabic , and chinese . [SEP]
[CLS] za ##men ##hof ' s goal to " enable the learn ##er to make direct use of his knowledge with persons of any nationality , whether the language be universally accepted or not " , as he wrote in 1887 , has been achieved , as the language is currently spoken by people living in more than 100 countries . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , one common criticism made is that es ##per ##anto has failed to live up to the hopes of its creator , who dreamed of it becoming a universal second language . [SEP]
[CLS] in this regard it has to be noted that za ##men ##hof was well aware that it might take much time , maybe even " many centuries " , to get this hope into reality . [SEP]
[CLS] in his speech at the world es ##per ##anto congress in cambridge in 1907 he said , " we hope that earlier or later , maybe after many centuries , on a neutral language foundation , understanding one each other , the nations will build . . . a big family circle . " [SEP]
[CLS] the alphabet does not include the letters " q , w , x , " or " y " , which are only used when writing una ##ssi ##mi ##lated foreign terms or proper names . [SEP]
[CLS] even with the widespread adoption of unicode , the letters with dia ##cr ##itic ##s ( found in the " latin - extended a " section of the unicode standard ) can cause problems with printing and computing , because they are not found on most physical keyboards and are left out of certain font ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] there are computer keyboard layout ##s that support the es ##per ##anto alphabet , and some systems use software that automatically replaces x - or h - convention dig ##raph ##s with the corresponding dia ##cr ##itic letters ( for example , for microsoft windows , mac os x , and linux , for windows phone , and gb ##oa ##rd and any ##so ##ft ##key ##board for android ) . [SEP]
[CLS] criticisms are made of the letters with ci ##rc ##um ##fle ##x dia ##cr ##itic ##s , which some find odd or cum ##bers ##ome , along with their being invented specifically for es ##per ##anto rather than borrowed from existing languages ; as well as being arguably unnecessary , as for example with the use of " h " instead of " x " and " u " instead of " w " . [SEP]
[CLS] the ph ##ono ##logy , grammar , vocabulary , and semantics are based on the indo - european languages spoken in europe . [SEP]
[CLS] the sound inventory is essentially slavic , as is much of the semantics , whereas the vocabulary derives primarily from the romance languages , with a lesser contribution from germanic languages and minor contributions from slavic languages and greek . [SEP]
[CLS] pr ##ag ##matic ##s and other aspects of the language not specified by za ##men ##hof ' s original documents were influenced by the native languages of early authors , primarily russian , polish , german , and french . [SEP]
[CLS] paul we ##x ##ler proposes that es ##per ##anto is re ##le ##xi ##fied yiddish , which he claims is in turn a re ##le ##xi ##fied slavic language , though this model is not accepted by mainstream academics . [SEP]
[CLS] adjective ##s can be freely placed before or after the nouns they modify , though placing them before the noun is more common . [SEP]
[CLS] this process is regular , so that people can create new words as they speak and be understood . [SEP]
[CLS] speakers may optional ##ly insert an " o " between the words in a compound noun if placing them together directly without the " o " would make the resulting word hard to say or understand . [SEP]
[CLS] the different parts of speech are marked by their own suffix ##es : all common nouns end in , all adjective ##s in , all derived ad ##ver ##bs in , and all verbs except the ju ##ssi ##ve ( or imperative ) end in , specifically in one of six tense and mood suffix ##es , such as the present tense ; the ju ##ssi ##ve mood , which is tense ##less , ends in . [SEP]
[CLS] the suffix , besides indicating the direct object , is used to indicate movement and a few other things as well . [SEP]
[CLS] they are present tense , future tense , past tense , in ##fin ##itive mood , conditional mood and ju ##ssi ##ve mood ( used for wishes and commands ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the vocabulary , for example , draws about two - thirds from romance and one - third from germanic languages ; the syntax is romance ; and the ph ##ono ##logy and semantics are slavic . [SEP]
[CLS] the grammar is arguably more european than not , but claude pi ##ron among others argues that the derivation system is not particularly european , though the in ##fle ##ction is . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is frequently accused of being inherently sex ##ist , because the default form of some nouns is masculine while a derived form is used for the feminine , which is said to retain traces of the male - dominated society of late 19th - century europe of which es ##per ##anto is a product . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , nouns that denote persons and whose definitions are not explicitly male are often assumed to be male unless explicitly made female , such as " do ##kt ##oro , " a phd doctor ( male or unspecified ) versus " do ##kt ##orin ##o , " a female phd . [SEP]
[CLS] the is normally pronounced like english " v , " but may be pronounced ( between english " v " and " w " ) or , depending on the language background of the speaker . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto has the five vowels found in such languages as classical latin , japanese , spanish , sw ##ah ##ili , modern hebrew , and modern greek . [SEP]
[CLS] since there are only five vowels , a good deal of variation in pronunciation is tolerated . [SEP]
[CLS] the rules of the language allowed speakers to borrow new roots as needed ; it was recommended , however , that speakers use most international forms and then derive related meanings from these . [SEP]
[CLS] since then , many words have been borrowed , primarily ( but not solely ) from the european languages . [SEP]
[CLS] words are also cal ##que ##d ; that is , words acquire new meanings based on usage in other languages . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the word " mouse " has acquired the meaning of a computer mouse from its usage in english . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto speakers often debate about whether a particular borrowing is justified or whether meaning can be expressed by der ##iving from or extending the meaning of existing words . [SEP]
[CLS] some compounds and formed words in es ##per ##anto are not entirely straightforward ; for example , , literally " give out " , means " publish " , parallel ##ing the usage of certain european languages ( such as german ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there are not many id ##iom ##atic or slang words in es ##per ##anto , as these forms of speech tend to make international communication difficult — working against es ##per ##anto ' s main goal . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of derivation ##s of es ##per ##anto roots , new roots are taken from european languages in the endeavor to create an international language . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto instruction is rarely available at schools , including four primary schools in a pilot project under the supervision of the university of manchester , and by one count at a few universities . [SEP]
[CLS] however , outside china and hungary , these mostly involve informal arrangements rather than dedicated departments or state sponsorship . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##ot ##vos lo ##rand university in budapest had a department of inter ##ling ##uis ##tics and es ##per ##anto from 1966 to 2004 , after which time instruction moved to vocational colleges ; there are state examinations for es ##per ##anto instructors . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , es ##per ##anto is notably offered as a weekly evening course at stanford university ' s be ##cht ##el international center . [SEP]
[CLS] conversation ##al es ##per ##anto , the international language , is a free drop - in class that is open to stanford students and the general public on campus during the academic year . [SEP]
[CLS] with administrative permission , stanford students can take the class for two credits a quarter through the linguistics department . [SEP]
[CLS] " even four lessons are enough to get more than just the basics , " the es ##per ##anto at stanford website reads . [SEP]
[CLS] after taking the es ##per ##anto course at their university and becoming fascinated with the language , two stanford students embarked on a research project travelling around europe to document the history and usage of es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] they visited formal institutions devoted to es ##per ##anto , including the es ##per ##anto museum in vienna , and participated in tours conducted in the language and distributed a survey to major es ##per ##anto organizations . [SEP]
[CLS] their research focused on the community of es ##per ##anto speakers with the hope of engaging the es ##per ##anto community and the public at large . [SEP]
[CLS] various educators have estimated that es ##per ##anto can be learned in anywhere from one quarter to one twentieth the amount of time required for other languages . [SEP]
[CLS] claude pi ##ron , an es ##per ##anto - activist and chinese – english – russian – spanish translator for the united nations , argued that es ##per ##anto is far more intuitive than many ethnic languages : " es ##per ##anto relies entirely on innate reflex ##es and differs from all other languages in that you can always trust your natural tendency to general ##ize patterns . . . [SEP]
[CLS] the institute of cyber ##net ##ic pe ##da ##go ##gy at pad ##er ##born university ( germany ) has compared the length of study time it takes native ##ly french - speaking high - school students to obtain comparable ' standard ' levels in es ##per ##anto , english , german , and italian . [SEP]
[CLS] four primary schools in britain , with 230 pupils , are currently following a course in " prop ##ae ##de ##uti ##c es ##per ##anto " — that is , instruction in es ##per ##anto to raise language awareness and accelerate subsequent learning of foreign languages — under the supervision of the university of manchester . [SEP]
[CLS] the results of these studies were favorable and demonstrated that studying es ##per ##anto before another foreign language ex ##ped ##ites the acquisition of the other , natural language . [SEP]
[CLS] in one study , a group of european secondary school students studied es ##per ##anto for one year , then french for three years , and ended up with a significantly better command of french than a control group , who studied french for all four years . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is by far the most widely spoken constructed language in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] speakers are most numerous in europe and east asia , especially in urban areas , where they often form es ##per ##anto clubs . [SEP]
[CLS] counter ##ing a common criticism against es ##per ##anto , the stat ##istic ##ian sven ##d nielsen has found there to be no significant correlation between the number of es ##per ##anto speakers and similarity of a given national mother language to es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] he concludes that es ##per ##anto tends to be more popular in countries that are rich , with widespread internet access and that tend to contribute more to science and culture . [SEP]
[CLS] linguistic diversity within a country was found to have a slight inverse correlation with es ##per ##anto popularity . [SEP]
[CLS] an estimate of the number of es ##per ##anto speakers was made by sidney s . cu ##lbert , a retired psychology professor at the university of washington and a longtime es ##per ##ant ##ist , who tracked down and tested es ##per ##anto speakers in sample areas in dozens of countries over a period of twenty years . [SEP]
[CLS] cu ##lbert ' s estimate was not made for es ##per ##anto alone , but formed part of his listing of estimates for all languages of more than one million speakers , published annually in the world alma ##nac and book of facts . [SEP]
[CLS] since cu ##lbert never published detailed intermediate results for particular countries and regions , it is difficult to independently gauge the accuracy of his results . [SEP]
[CLS] in the alma ##nac , his estimates for numbers of language speakers were rounded to the nearest million , thus the number for es ##per ##anto speakers is shown as two million . [SEP]
[CLS] he estimated that even if es ##per ##anto speakers were evenly distributed , assuming one million es ##per ##anto speakers worldwide would lead one to expect about 180 in the city of cologne . [SEP]
[CLS] van di ##jk finds only 30 fluent speakers in that city , and similarly smaller - than - expected figures in several other places thought to have a larger - than - average concentration of es ##per ##anto speakers . [SEP]
[CLS] though there are undoubtedly many es ##per ##anto speakers who are not members of any es ##per ##anto organization , he thinks it unlikely that there are fifty times more speakers than organization members . [SEP]
[CLS] this number , however , was disputed by stat ##istic ##ian ste ##n johansson , who questioned the reliability of the source data and highlighted a wide margin of error , the latter point with which nielsen agrees . [SEP]
[CLS] in the absence of dr . cu ##lbert ' s detailed sampling data , or any other census data , it is impossible to state the number of speakers with certainty . [SEP]
[CLS] this usually happens when es ##per ##anto is the chief or only common language in an international family , but sometimes occurs in a family of es ##per ##anto speakers who often use the language . [SEP]
[CLS] as of 1996 , there were approximately 350 attested cases of families with native es ##per ##anto speakers ( which means there were around 700 es ##per ##anto speaking natives in these families , not calculating older native speakers ) . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##ant ##ists use the language for free accommodations with es ##per ##ant ##ists in 92 countries using the or to develop pen pal ##s through " " . [SEP]
[CLS] lou harrison , who incorporated styles and instruments from many world cultures in his music , used es ##per ##anto titles and / or texts in several of his works , most notably ( 1973 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] david gaines used es ##per ##anto poems as well as an excerpt from a speech by dr . za ##men ##hof for his " symphony no . [SEP]
[CLS] proponents , such as prof . humphrey ton ##kin of the university of hartford , observe that es ##per ##anto is " culturally neutral by design , as it was intended to be a fa ##ci ##lita ##tor between cultures , not to be the carrier of any one national culture " . [SEP]
[CLS] the late scottish es ##per ##anto author william au ##ld wrote extensively on the subject , arguing that es ##per ##anto is " the expression of a common human culture , une ##nc ##umber ##ed by national frontiers . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of es ##per ##anto associations also advance education in and about the international language es ##per ##anto and aim to preserve and promote the culture and heritage of es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] typically , this is done either to add the exotic flavour of a foreign language without representing any particular ethnicity , or to avoid going to the trouble of in ##venting a new language . [SEP]
[CLS] two full - length feature films have been produced with dialogue entirely in es ##per ##anto : " , " in 1964 , and " inc ##ub ##us , " a 1965 b - movie horror film which is also notable for starring william sha ##tner shortly before he began working on " " . [SEP]
[CLS] a language school teaching " en ##tre ##nation ##o " ( representing a satire on es ##per ##anto ) is featured in graham greene ' s novel " the confidential agent " , which was made into a film starring charles boyer and lauren ba ##cal ##l ( 1945 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] other amateur productions have been made , such as a drama ##ti ##zation of the novel ( ge ##rda has disappeared ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of mainstream films in national languages have used es ##per ##anto in some way . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is used as the universal language in the far future of harry harrison ' s " stainless steel rat " and " death ##world " stories . [SEP]
[CLS] po ##ul anderson ' s story " high treason " takes place in a future where earth became united politically but was still divided into many languages and cultures , and es ##per ##anto became the language of its space armed forces , fighting wars with various extra ##ter ##rest ##rial races . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the first game in the series that was played online , and would have players from both japan and north america ( official european support was added after the north american launch ) playing together on the same servers , using an auto - translate tool to communicate . [SEP]
[CLS] in the geek fiction novel " off to be the wizard " , es ##per ##anto is programmed as the language that triggers all of the wizard ' s spells . [SEP]
[CLS] a teacher explains that this is because " no one really speaks es ##per ##anto and it ' s easy to learn " . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto is found in the image comics series " saga " as the language blue , spoken by the horned inhabitants of wreath . [SEP]
[CLS] blue is generally only spoken by inhabitants of wreath , while most other cultures use a universal language that appears to be simply named " language . " [SEP]
[CLS] some wreath inhabitants use translator rings to communicate with those who don ' t speak blue . [SEP]
[CLS] in the television show " red dwarf " , which begins in the late 22nd century , crew ##man arnold rim ##mer constantly spends his time trying to learn es ##per ##anto and failing , even compared to his bunk ##mate dave lister who only maintains a casual interest . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally many of the signs around the ship " red dwarf " are written in both english and es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] the novel " infinity welcome ##s careful drivers " states that , although not required , it is widely expected that officers in the space corps be fluent in the language , hence rim ##mer ' s interest . [SEP]
[CLS] a few scientists and mathematicians , such as maurice fr ##eche ##t ( mathematics ) , john c . wells ( linguistics ) , helm ##ar frank ( pe ##da ##go ##gy and cyber ##net ##ics ) , and nobel laureate rein ##hard se ##lten ( economics ) have published part of their work in es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] frank and se ##lten were among the founders of the international academy of sciences in san marino , sometimes called the " es ##per ##anto university " , where es ##per ##anto is the primary language of teaching and administration . [SEP]
[CLS] the french chamber of commerce did research in the 1920s and reported in " the new york times " in 1921 that es ##per ##anto seemed to be the best business language . [SEP]
[CLS] za ##men ##hof had three goals , as he wrote already in 1887 : to create an easy language , to create a language ready to use " whether the language be universally accepted or not " and to find some means to get many people learn the language . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto was to serve as an international auxiliary language , that is , as a universal second language , not to replace ethnic languages . [SEP]
[CLS] later , es ##per ##anto speakers began to see the language and the culture that had grown up around it as ends in themselves , even if es ##per ##anto is never adopted by the united nations or other international organizations . [SEP]
[CLS] es ##per ##anto speakers who want to see es ##per ##anto adopted officially or on a large scale worldwide are commonly called , from , meaning " final victory " . [SEP]
[CLS] it has to be noted that there are two kinds of " fin ##ven ##kis ##mo " – " des ##ub ##ism ##o " and " des ##up ##ris ##mo " ; the first aims to spread es ##per ##anto between ordinary people ( " des ##ub ##e " , from below ) aiming to form a steadily growing community of es ##per ##anto speakers . [SEP]
[CLS] za ##men ##hof considered the first way to have a better perspective , as " for such affairs as ours , governments come with their approval and help usually only , when everything is already completely finished " . [SEP]
