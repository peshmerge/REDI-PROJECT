google changed its search indexing tools to demote sites that have been accused of piracy .
in october 2016 , gary illyes , a webmaster trends analyst with google , announced that the search engine would be making a separate , primary web index for mobile devices , with a secondary , less up-to-date index for desktop use .
the change was a response to the growth of mobile usage , and a push for web developers to adopt a mobile-friendly version of their websites .
in august 2009 , google asked web developers to test a new search architecture , codenamed caffeine , and give their feedback .
the move was interpreted in some quarters as a response to microsoft 's recent release of an upgraded version of its own search service , renamed bing , as well as the launch of wolfram alpha , a new search engine based on " computational knowledge " .

google 's rise was largely due to a patented algorithm called pagerank which helps rank web pages that match a given search string .
other keywords to rank search results , used by many search engines that were once more popular than google , would check how often the search terms occurred in a page , or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page .
the algorithm computes a recursive score for pages , based on the weighted sum of other pages linking to them .

the upgrade marked the most significant change to google search in years , with more " human " search interactions and a much heavier focus on conversation and meaning .
