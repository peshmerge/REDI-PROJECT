google indexes hundreds of terabytes of information from web pages .
google indexes some file types , being able to show users pdfs , word documents , excel spreadsheets , powerpoint presentations , certain flash multimedia content , and plain text files .
despite google search , sources generally assume that google is only indexing less than 5 % of the total internet , with the rest belonging to the deep web , inaccessible through its search tools .
google changed its search indexing tools to demote sites that have been accused of piracy .
in october 2016 , gary illyes , a webmaster trends analyst with google , announced that the search engine would be making a separate , primary web index for mobile devices , with a secondary , less up-to-date index for desktop use .
the change was a response to the growth of mobile usage , and a push for web developers to adopt a mobile-friendly version of their websites .
in august 2009 , google asked web developers to test a new search architecture , codenamed caffeine , and give their feedback .
the move was interpreted in some quarters as a response to microsoft 's recent release of an upgraded version of its own search service , renamed bing , as well as the launch of wolfram alpha , a new search engine based on " computational knowledge " .
as per current analysis done by the industry leaders search engine watch and search engine land , the update was to drop down the medical and health related websites that were not user friendly and were not good to give good user experience .

this feature originally allowed users to type in their search query , click the button and be taken directly to the first result , bypassing the search results page .
with the 2010 announcement of google instant , an automatic feature that immediately displays relevant results as users are typing in their query , the " i 'm feeling lucky " button disappears .

google 's rise was largely due to a patented algorithm called pagerank which helps rank web pages that match a given search string .
other keywords to rank search results , used by many search engines that were once more popular than google , would check how often the search terms occurred in a page , or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page .
the algorithm computes a recursive score for pages , based on the weighted sum of other pages linking to them .
this is reported to comprise over 250 different indicators , the specifics of which are kept secret to avoid difficulties created by scammers and help google maintain an edge over its competitors globally .

according to google , it was not the frequently published consumer complaints about decormyeyes which resulted in the high ranking but mentions on news websites of events which affected the firm such as legal actions against it .
the upgrade marked the most significant change to google search in years , with more " human " search interactions and a much heavier focus on conversation and meaning .
