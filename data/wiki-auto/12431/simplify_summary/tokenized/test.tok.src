[CLS] google search , also referred to as google web search or simply google , is a web search engine developed by google llc . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the most used search engine on the world wide web across all platforms , with 92 . 62 % market share as of june 2019 , handling more than 5 . 4 billion searches each day . [SEP]
[CLS] the order of search results returned by google is based , in part , on a priority rank system called " page ##rank " . [SEP]
[CLS] google search also provides many different options for customized search , using symbols to include , exclude , specify or require certain search behavior , and offers specialized interactive experiences , such as flight status and package tracking , weather forecast ##s , currency , unit and time conversions , word definitions , and more . [SEP]
[CLS] the main purpose of google search is to hunt for text in publicly accessible documents offered by web servers , as opposed to other data , such as images or data contained in databases . [SEP]
[CLS] it was originally developed in 1997 by larry page , sergey br ##in , and scott hassan . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 2011 , google introduced " google voice search " to search for spoken , rather than typed , words . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 2012 , google introduced a knowledge graph semantic search feature in the u . s . [SEP]
[CLS] analysis of the frequency of search terms may indicate economic , social and health trends . [SEP]
[CLS] data about the frequency of use of search terms on google can be openly inquired via google trends and have been shown to co ##rre ##late with flu outbreak ##s and unemployment levels , and provide the information faster than traditional reporting methods and surveys . [SEP]
[CLS] as of mid - 2016 , google ' s search engine has begun to rely on deep neural networks . [SEP]
[CLS] competitors of google include bai ##du and so ##so . com in china ; nave ##r . com and da ##um . net in south korea ; yan ##de ##x in russia ; se ##z ##nam . c ##z in the czech republic ; yahoo in japan , taiwan and the us , as well as bing and duck ##du ##ck ##go . [SEP]
[CLS] some smaller search engines offer facilities not available with google , e . g . not storing any private or tracking information . [SEP]
[CLS] within the u . s . , as of july 2018 , microsoft sites handled 24 . 2 percent of all search que ##ries . [SEP]
[CLS] during the same period of time , oath ( formerly known as yahoo ) had a search market share of 11 . 5 percent . [SEP]
[CLS] market leader google generated 63 . 2 percent of all core search que ##ries in the u . s . [SEP]
[CLS] google index ##es hundreds of ter ##aby ##tes of information from web pages . [SEP]
[CLS] for websites that are currently down or otherwise not available , google provides links to cache ##d versions of the site , formed by the search engine ' s latest index ##ing of that page . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , google index ##es some file types , being able to show users pdf ##s , word documents , excel spreads ##hee ##ts , power ##point presentations , certain flash multimedia content , and plain text files . [SEP]
[CLS] users can also activate " safe ##sea ##rch " , a filtering technology aimed at preventing explicit and pornographic content from appearing in search results . [SEP]
[CLS] despite google search ' s immense index , sources generally assume that google is only index ##ing less than 5 % of the total internet , with the rest belonging to the deep web , inaccessible through its search tools . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2012 , google changed its search index ##ing tools to demo ##te sites that had been accused of piracy . [SEP]
[CLS] in october 2016 , gary ill ##yes , a web ##master trends analyst with google , announced that the search engine would be making a separate , primary web index dedicated for mobile devices , with a secondary , less up - to - date index for desktop use . [SEP]
[CLS] the change was a response to the continued growth in mobile usage , and a push for web developers to adopt a mobile - friendly version of their websites . [SEP]
[CLS] in december 2017 , google began rolling out the change , having already done so for multiple websites . [SEP]
[CLS] in august 2009 , google invited web developers to test a new search architecture , code ##name ##d " caf ##fe ##ine " , and give their feedback . [SEP]
[CLS] the new architecture provided no visual differences in the user interface , but added significant speed improvements and a new " under - the - hood " index ##ing infrastructure . [SEP]
[CLS] the move was interpreted in some quarters as a response to microsoft ' s recent release of an upgraded version of its own search service , renamed bing , as well as the launch of wolf ##ram alpha , a new search engine based on " computational knowledge " . [SEP]
[CLS] google announced completion of " caf ##fe ##ine " on june 8 , 2010 , claiming 50 % fresh ##er results due to continuous up ##dating of its index . [SEP]
[CLS] with " caf ##fe ##ine " , google moved its back - end index ##ing system away from map ##red ##uce and onto big ##table , the company ' s distributed database platform . [SEP]
[CLS] in august 2018 , danny sullivan from google announced a broad core algorithm update . [SEP]
[CLS] as per current analysis done by the industry leaders search engine watch and search engine land , the update was to drop down the medical and health related websites that were not user friendly and were not providing good user experience . [SEP]
[CLS] this is why the industry experts named it " med ##ic " . [SEP]
[CLS] google reserves very high standards for y ##my ##l ( your money or your life ) pages . [SEP]
[CLS] this is because mis ##in ##form ##ation can affect users financially , physically or emotionally . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , the update targeted particularly those y ##my ##l pages that have low - quality content and mis ##in ##form ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] this resulted in the algorithm targeting health and medical related websites more than others . [SEP]
[CLS] however , many other websites from other industries were also negatively affected . [SEP]
[CLS] google search consists of a series of localized websites . [SEP]
[CLS] the largest of those , the google . com site , is the top most - visited website in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] some of its features include a definition link for most searches including dictionary words , the number of results you got on your search , links to other searches ( e . g . for words that google believes to be miss ##pel ##led , it provides a link to the search results using its proposed spelling ) , and many more . [SEP]
[CLS] google search accepts que ##ries as normal text , as well as individual key ##words . [SEP]
[CLS] it automatically correct ##s miss ##pel ##led words , and yields the same results regardless of capital ##ization . [SEP]
[CLS] google applies query expansion to submitted search que ##ries , using techniques to deliver results that it considers " smarter " than the query users actually submitted . [SEP]
[CLS] this technique involves several steps , including : in 2008 , google started to give users auto ##com ##ple ##ted search suggestions in a list below the search bar while typing . [SEP]
[CLS] google ' s home ##page includes a button labeled " i ' m feeling lucky " . [SEP]
[CLS] this feature originally allowed users to type in their search query , click the button and be taken directly to the first result , bypass ##ing the search results page . [SEP]
[CLS] with the 2010 announcement of google instant , an automatic feature that immediately displays relevant results as users are typing in their query , the " i ' m feeling lucky " button disappears , requiring that users opt - out of instant results through search settings in order to keep using the " i ' m feeling lucky " functionality . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2012 , " i ' m feeling lucky " was changed to serve as an advertisement for google services ; users hove ##r their computer mouse over the button , it spins and shows an emotion ( " i ' m feeling puzzled " or " i ' m feeling trend ##y " , for instance ) , and , when clicked , takes users to a google service related to that emotion . [SEP]
[CLS] tom chavez of " rap ##t " , a firm helping to determine a website ' s advertising worth , estimated in 2007 that google lost $ 110 million in revenue per year due to use of the button , which bypass ##es the advertisements found on the search results page . [SEP]
[CLS] besides the main text - based search - engine features of google search , it also offers multiple quick , interactive experiences . [SEP]
[CLS] during google ' s developer conference , google i / o , in may 2013 , the company announced that , on google chrome and chrome os , users would be able to say " ok google " , with the browser initiating an audio - based search , with no button presses required . [SEP]
[CLS] after having the answer presented , users can follow up with additional , context ##ual questions ; an example include initially asking " ok google , will it be sunny in santa cruz this weekend ? " , [SEP]
[CLS] , hearing a spoken answer , and reply with " how far is it from here ? " [SEP]
[CLS] an update to the chrome browser with voice - search functionality rolled out a week later , though it required a button press on a microphone icon rather than " ok google " voice activation . [SEP]
[CLS] google released a browser extension for the chrome browser , named with a " beta " tag for unfinished development , shortly thereafter . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 2014 , the company officially added " ok google " into the browser itself ; they removed it in october 2015 , citing low usage , though the microphone icon for activation remained available . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 2016 , 20 % of search que ##ries on mobile devices were done through voice . [SEP]
[CLS] " universal search " was launched by google on may 16 , 2007 as an idea that merged the results from different kinds of search types into one . [SEP]
[CLS] prior to universal search , a standard google search would consist of links only to websites . [SEP]
[CLS] universal search , however , incorporates a wide variety of sources , including websites , news , pictures , maps , blogs , videos , and more , all shown on the same search results page . [SEP]
[CLS] marissa mayer , then - vice president of search products and user experience , described the goal of universal search as " we ' re attempting to break down the walls that traditionally separated our various search properties and integrate the vast amounts of information available into one simple set of search results . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 2017 , google expanded its search results to cover available job listings . [SEP]
[CLS] the data is aggregate ##d from various major job boards and collected by analyzing company home ##page ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] initially only available in english , the feature aims to sim ##plify finding jobs suitable for each user . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 2009 , google announced that they would be par ##sing website micro ##form ##ats in order to pop ##ulate search result pages with " rich s ##ni ##ppet ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] such s ##ni ##ppet ##s include additional details about results , such as displaying reviews for restaurants and social media accounts for individuals . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 2016 , google expanded on the " rich s ##ni ##ppet ##s " format to offer " rich cards " , which , similarly to s ##ni ##ppet ##s , display more information about results , but shows them at the top of the mobile website in a sw ##ipe ##able carousel - like format . [SEP]
[CLS] originally limited to movie and recipe websites in the united states only , the feature expanded to all countries globally in 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] the knowledge graph is a knowledge base used by google to enhance its search engine ' s results with information gathered from a variety of sources . [SEP]
[CLS] this information is presented to users in a box to the right of search results . [SEP]
[CLS] knowledge graph boxes were added to google ' s search engine in may 2012 , starting in the united states , with international expansion by the end of the year . [SEP]
[CLS] the information covered by the knowledge graph grew significantly after launch , trip ##ling its original size within seven months , and being able to answer " roughly one - third " of the 100 billion monthly searches google processed in may 2016 . [SEP]
[CLS] the information is often used as a spoken answer in google assistant and google home searches . [SEP]
[CLS] the knowledge graph has been criticized for providing answers without source at ##tri ##bution . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 2017 , google enabled a new " personal " tab in google search , letting users search for content in their google accounts ' various services , including email messages from gma ##il and photos from google photos . [SEP]
[CLS] the google feed is a personal ##ized stream of articles , videos , and other news - related content . [SEP]
[CLS] the feed contains a " mix of cards " which show topics of interest based on users ' interactions with google , or topics they choose to follow directly . [SEP]
[CLS] cards include , " links to news stories , youtube videos , sports scores , recipes , and other content based on what google determined you ' re most likely to be interested in at that particular moment . " [SEP]
[CLS] users can also tell google they ' re not interested in certain topics to avoid seeing future updates . [SEP]
[CLS] the google feed launched in december 2016 and received a major update in july 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] as of may 2018 , the google feed can be found on the google app and by sw ##ip ##ing left on the home screen of certain android devices . [SEP]
[CLS] google ' s rise was largely due to a patented algorithm called page ##rank which helps rank web pages that match a given search string . [SEP]
[CLS] when google was a stanford research project , it was nicknamed back ##ru ##b because the technology checks back ##link ##s to determine a site ' s importance . [SEP]
[CLS] other key ##word - based methods to rank search results , used by many search engines that were once more popular than google , would check how often the search terms occurred in a page , or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page . [SEP]
[CLS] the page ##rank algorithm instead analyze ##s human - generated links assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are also important . [SEP]
[CLS] the algorithm compute ##s a rec ##urs ##ive score for pages , based on the weighted sum of other pages linking to them . [SEP]
[CLS] page ##rank is thought to co ##rre ##late well with human concepts of importance . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to page ##rank , google , over the years , has added many other secret criteria for determining the ranking of resulting pages . [SEP]
[CLS] this is reported to comprise over 250 different indicators , the specific ##s of which are kept secret to avoid difficulties created by sc ##am ##mers and help google maintain an edge over its competitors globally . [SEP]
[CLS] page ##rank was influenced by a similar page - ranking and site - scoring algorithm earlier used for rank ##de ##x , developed by robin li in 1996 . [SEP]
[CLS] larry page ' s patent for page ##rank filed in 1998 includes a citation to li ' s earlier patent . [SEP]
[CLS] li later went on to create the chinese search engine bai ##du in 2000 . [SEP]
[CLS] in a potential hint of google ' s future direction of their search algorithm , google ' s then chief executive eric schmidt , said in a 2007 interview with the " financial times " : " the goal is to enable google users to be able to ask the question such as ' what shall i do tomorrow ? ' [SEP]
[CLS] and ' what job shall i take ? ' " . [SEP]
[CLS] schmidt re ##af ##firmed this during a 2010 interview with the wall street journal : " i actually think most people don ' t want google to answer their questions , they want google to tell them what they should be doing next . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 2013 the european commission found that google search favored google ' s own products , instead of the best result for consumers ' needs . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 2015 google announced a major change to its mobile search algorithm which would favor mobile friendly over other websites . [SEP]
[CLS] nearly 60 % of google searches come from mobile phones . [SEP]
[CLS] google says it wants users to have access to premium quality websites . [SEP]
[CLS] those websites which lack a mobile friendly interface would be ranked lower and it is expected that this update will cause a shake - up of ranks . [SEP]
[CLS] businesses who fail to update their websites accordingly could see a dip in their regular websites traffic . [SEP]
[CLS] because google is the most popular search engine , many web ##masters attempt to influence their website ' s google rankings . [SEP]
[CLS] an industry of consultants has arise ##n to help websites increase their rankings on google and on other search engines . [SEP]
[CLS] this field , called search engine optimization , attempts to disc ##ern patterns in search engine listings , and then develop a methodology for improving rankings to draw more search ##ers to their clients ' sites . [SEP]
[CLS] search engine optimization encompasses both " on page " factors ( like body copy , title elements , h ##1 heading elements and image alt attribute values ) and off page optimization factors ( like anchor text and page ##rank ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the general idea is to affect google ' s relevance algorithm by incorporating the key ##words being targeted in various places " on page " , in particular the title element and the body copy ( note : the higher up in the page , presumably the better its key ##word prominence and thus the ranking ) . [SEP]
[CLS] too many occurrences of the key ##word , however , cause the page to look suspect to google ' s spa ##m checking algorithms . [SEP]
[CLS] google has published guidelines for website owners who would like to raise their rankings when using legitimate optimization consultants . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized , and , allegedly , is the opinion of the owner of one business about which there have been numerous complaints , that negative publicity , for example , numerous consumer complaints , may serve as well to el ##eva ##te page rank on google search as favorable comments . [SEP]
[CLS] the particular problem addressed in " the new york times " article , which involved decor ##my ##eye ##s , was addressed shortly thereafter by an undisclosed fix in the google algorithm . [SEP]
[CLS] according to google , it was not the frequently published consumer complaints about decor ##my ##eye ##s which resulted in the high ranking but mentions on news websites of events which affected the firm such as legal actions against it . [SEP]
[CLS] google search console helps to check for websites that use duplicate or copyright content . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2013 , google significantly upgraded its search algorithm with " humming ##bird " . [SEP]
[CLS] its name was derived from the speed and accuracy of the humming ##bird . [SEP]
[CLS] the change was announced on september 26 , 2013 , having already been in use for a month . [SEP]
[CLS] " humming ##bird " places greater emphasis on natural language que ##ries , considering context and meaning over individual key ##words . [SEP]
[CLS] it also looks deeper at content on individual pages of a website , with improved ability to lead users directly to the most appropriate page rather than just a website ' s home ##page . [SEP]
[CLS] the upgrade marked the most significant change to google search in years , with more " human " search interactions and a much heavier focus on conversation and meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , web developers and writers were encouraged to opt ##imi ##ze their sites with natural writing rather than forced key ##words , and make effective use of technical web development for on - site navigation . [SEP]
[CLS] on certain occasions , the logo on google ' s web ##page will change to a special version , known as a " google doo ##dle " . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a picture , drawing , animation or interactive game that includes the logo . [SEP]
[CLS] it is usually done for a special event or day although not all of them are well known . [SEP]
[CLS] clicking on the doo ##dle links to a string of google search results about the topic . [SEP]
[CLS] the first was a reference to the burning man festival in 1998 , and others have been produced for the birthday ##s of notable people like albert einstein , historical events like the inter ##lock ##ing lego block ' s 50th anniversary and holidays like valentine ' s day . [SEP]
[CLS] some google doo ##dles have interact ##ivity beyond a simple search , such as the famous " google pac ##man " version that appeared on may 21 , 2010 . [SEP]
[CLS] google offers a " google search " mobile app for android and ios devices . [SEP]
[CLS] the mobile apps exclusively feature a " feed " , a news feed - style page of continually - updated developments on news and topics of interest to individual users . [SEP]
[CLS] android devices were introduced to a preview of the feed in december 2016 , while it was made official on both android and ios in july 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] in april 2016 , google updated its search app on android to feature " trends " ; search que ##ries gaining popularity appeared in the auto ##com ##ple ##te box along with normal query auto ##com ##ple ##tion . [SEP]
[CLS] the update received significant backlash , due to encouraging search que ##ries unrelated to users ' interests or intentions , prompting the company to issue an update with an opt - out option . [SEP]
[CLS] in september 2017 , the google search app on ios was updated to feature the same functionality . [SEP]
[CLS] until may 2013 , google search had offered a feature to translate search que ##ries into other languages . [SEP]
[CLS] a google spokesperson told " search engine land " that " removing features is always tough , but we do think very hard about each decision and its implications for our users . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , this feature never saw much pick up " . [SEP]
[CLS] instant search was announced in september 2010 as a feature that displayed suggested results while the user typed in their search query . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary advantage of the new system was its ability to save time , with marissa mayer , then - vice president of search products and user experience , pro ##claiming that the feature would save 2 – 5 seconds per search , el ##ab ##ora ##ting that " that may not seem like a lot at first , but it adds up . [SEP]
[CLS] with google instant , we estimate that we ' ll save our users 11 hours with each passing second ! " [SEP]
[CLS] matt van wagner of " search engine land " wrote that " personally , i kind of like google instant and i think it represents a natural evolution in the way search works " , and also praised google ' s efforts in public relations , writing that " with just a press conference and a few well - placed interviews , google has par ##lay ##ed this relatively minor speed improvement into an attention - grabbing front - page news story " . [SEP]
[CLS] the upgrade also became notable for the company switching google search ' s underlying technology from html to ajax . [SEP]
[CLS] instant search could be disabled via google ' s " preferences " menu for those who didn ' t want its functionality . [SEP]
[CLS] " pc magazine " discussed the inc ##ons ##iste ##ncy in how some forms of the same topic are allowed ; for instance , " lesbian " was blocked , while " gay " was not , and " cocaine " was blocked , while " crack " and " heroin " were not . [SEP]
[CLS] the report further stated that seemingly normal words were also blocked due to pornographic inn ##uen ##dos , most notably " sc ##at " , likely due to having two completely separate context ##ual meanings , one for music and one for a sexual practice . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 2017 , google removed instant results , due to a growing number of searches on mobile devices , where interaction with search , as well as screen sizes , differ significantly from a computer . [SEP]
[CLS] various search engines provide en ##cr ##yp ##ted web search facilities . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 2010 google rolled out ss ##l - en ##cr ##yp ##ted web search . [SEP]
[CLS] the en ##cr ##yp ##ted search was accessed at cod ##ice _ 12 however , the web search is en ##cr ##yp ##ted via transport layer security ( t ##ls ) by default today , thus every search request should be automatically en ##cr ##yp ##ted if t ##ls is supported by the web browser . [SEP]
[CLS] on its support website , google announced that the address cod ##ice _ 12 would be turned off april 30 , 2018 , stating that all google products and most new browser ##s use https connections as the reason for the disco ##nti ##nu ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] google real - time search was a feature of google search in which search results also sometimes included real - time information from sources such as twitter , facebook , blogs , and news websites . [SEP]
[CLS] the feature was introduced on december 7 , 2009 and went off ##line on july 2 , 2011 after the deal with twitter expired . [SEP]
[CLS] real - time search included facebook status updates beginning on february 24 , 2010 . [SEP]
[CLS] a feature similar to real - time search was already available on microsoft ' s bing search engine , which showed results from twitter and facebook . [SEP]
[CLS] the interface for the engine showed a live , descending " river " of posts in the main region ( which could be paused or resumed ) , while a bar chart metric of the frequency of posts containing a certain search term or hash ##tag was located on the right hand corner of the page above a list of most frequently rep ##ost ##ed posts and outgoing links . [SEP]
[CLS] hash ##tag search links were also supported , as were " promoted " t ##wee ##ts hosted by twitter ( located persistent ##ly on top of the river ) and thumb ##nail ##s of re ##t ##wee ##ted image or video links . [SEP]
[CLS] in january 2011 , geo ##lo ##cation links of posts were made available alongside results in real - time search . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , posts containing syndicated or attached shortened links were made search ##able by the " link : " query option . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 2011 real - time search became inaccessible , with the real - time link in the google side ##bar disappearing and a custom 404 error page generated by google returned at its former ur ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] google originally suggested that the interruption was temporary and related to the launch of google + ; they subsequently announced that it was due to the ex ##pi ##ry of a commercial arrangement with twitter to provide access to t ##wee ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] searches made by search engines , including google , leave traces . [SEP]
[CLS] this raises concerns about privacy . [SEP]
[CLS] in principle , if details of a user ' s searches are found , those with access to the information — principally state agencies responsible for law enforcement and similar matters — can make de ##duction ##s about the user ' s activities . [SEP]
[CLS] this has been used for the detection and prosecution of law ##breakers ; for example a murderer was found and convicted after searching for terms such as " tips with killing with a baseball bat " . [SEP]
[CLS] a search may leave traces both on a computer used to make the search , and in records kept by the search provider . [SEP]
[CLS] when using a search engine through a browser program on a computer , search terms and other information may be stored on the computer by default , unless the browser is set not to do this , or they are erased . [SEP]
[CLS] saved terms may be discovered on forensic analysis of the computer . [SEP]
[CLS] an internet service provider ( is ##p ) or search engine provider ( e . g . , google ) may store records which relate search terms to an ip address and a time . [SEP]
[CLS] whether such logs are kept , and access to them by law enforcement agencies , is subject to legislation in different jurisdictions and working practices ; the law may mandate , prohibit , or say nothing about logging of various types of information . [SEP]
[CLS] some search engines , located in jurisdictions where it is not illegal , make a feature of not storing user search information . [SEP]
[CLS] the key ##words suggested by the auto ##com ##ple ##te feature show a population of users ' research which is made possible by an identity management system . [SEP]
[CLS] volumes of personal data are collected via eddy ##stone web and proximity beacon ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] google has been criticized for placing long - term cookies on users ' machines to store these preferences , a tactic which also enables them to track a user ' s search terms and retain the data for more than a year . [SEP]
[CLS] since 2012 , google inc . has globally introduced en ##cr ##yp ##ted connections for most of its clients , in order to bypass govern ##ative blocking ##s of the commercial and it services . [SEP]
[CLS] in late june 2011 , google introduced a new look to the google home page in order to boost the use of the google + social tools . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the major changes was replacing the classic navigation bar with a black one . [SEP]
[CLS] google ' s digital creative director chris wig ##gins explains : " we ' re working on a project to bring you a new and improved google experience , and over the next few months , you ' ll continue to see more updates to our look and feel . " [SEP]
[CLS] the new navigation bar has been negatively received by a vocal minority . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 2013 , google started testing yellow labels for advertisements displayed in search results , to improve user experience . [SEP]
[CLS] the new labels , highlighted in yellow color , and aligned to the left of each sponsored link help users clearly differentiate between organic and sponsored results . [SEP]
[CLS] on december 15 , 2016 , google rolled out a new desktop search interface that mimic ##s their modular mobile user interface . [SEP]
[CLS] the mobile design consists of a tab ##ular design that highlights search features in boxes . [SEP]
[CLS] and works by im ##itating the desktop knowledge graph real estate , which appears in the right - hand rail of the search engine result page , these featured elements frequently feature twitter carousel ##s , people also search for , and top stories ( vertical and horizontal design ) modules . [SEP]
[CLS] the local pack and answer box were two of the original features of the google ser ##p that were primarily showcased in this manner , but this new layout creates a previously unseen level of design consistency for google results . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to its tool for searching web pages , google also provides services for searching images , use ##net news ##group ##s , news websites , videos , searching by locality , maps , and items for sale online . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2012 , google has indexed over 30 trillion web pages , and received 100 billion que ##ries per month . [SEP]
[CLS] it also cache ##s much of the content that it index ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] google operates other tools and services including google news , google shopping , google maps , google custom search , google earth , google doc ##s , pic ##asa , pan ##ora ##mi ##o , youtube , google translate , google blog search and google desktop search . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also products available from google that are not directly search - related . [SEP]
[CLS] gma ##il , for example , is a web ##mail application , but still includes search features ; google browser sync does not offer any search facilities , although it aims to organize your brows ##ing time . [SEP]
[CLS] also google starts many new beta products , like google social search or google image swirl . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2009 , google claimed that a search query requires altogether about 1 k ##j or 0 . 000 ##3 kw · h , which is enough to raise the temperature of one liter of water by 0 . 24 °c . [SEP]
[CLS] according to green search engine eco ##sia , the industry standard for search engines is estimated to be about 0 . 2 grams of co emission per search . [SEP]
[CLS] google ' s 40 , 000 searches per second translate to 8 kg co per second or over 252 million ki ##los of co per year . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2003 , " the new york times " complained about google ' s index ##ing , claiming that google ' s ca ##ching of content on its site in ##fr ##inge ##d its copyright for the content . [SEP]
[CLS] in both " field v . google " and " parker v . google " , the united states district court of nevada ruled in favor of google . [SEP]
[CLS] google flags search results with the message " this site may harm your computer " if the site is known to install malicious software in the background or otherwise sur ##re ##pt ##iti ##ously . [SEP]
[CLS] google does this to protect users against visiting sites that could harm their computers . [SEP]
