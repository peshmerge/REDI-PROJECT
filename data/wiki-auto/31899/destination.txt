The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a "declaration" (something said in an important way) by the United Nations General Assembly.
It talks about basic human rights -- rights that all people have just because they are human.
It was "adopted" (agreed to) by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948.
The UDHR (initialism for Universal Declaration of Human Rights) is translated into over 300 languages.
This is more languages than any other document, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.
The UDHR may be broken into 30 parts or "articles".

The United Nations Human Development Report (UNHDR) has been criticised by different people.
Mainly Islamic countries have pointed out that its understanding is mainly that of Christians or Jews.
Muslims could not implement certain parts of the declaration, without trespassing Islamic law.
On 30 June 2000, Muslim nations that are members of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference officially resolved to support the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam, an alternative document that says people have "freedom and right to a dignified life in accordance with the Islamic Shari’ah".
