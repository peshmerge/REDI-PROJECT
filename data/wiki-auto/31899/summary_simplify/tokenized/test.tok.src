[CLS] the universal declaration of human rights ( ud ##hr ) is a historic document that was adopted by the united nations general assembly at its third session on 10 december 1948 as resolution 217 at the palais de cha ##illo ##t in paris , france . [SEP]
[CLS] the declaration was the first step in the process of formula ##ting the international bill of human rights , which was completed in 1966 , and came into force in 1976 , after a sufficient number of countries had ratified them . [SEP]
[CLS] some legal scholars have argued that because countries have constantly invoked the declaration for more than 50 years , it has become binding as a part of customary international law . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in the united states , the supreme court in " so ##sa v . alvarez - mach ##ain " ( 2004 ) , concluded that the declaration " does not of its own force impose obligations as a matter of international law . " [SEP]
[CLS] the underlying structure of the universal declaration was introduced in its second draft , which was prepared by rene cass ##in . [SEP]
[CLS] these articles are concerned with the duty of the individual to society and the prohibition of use of rights in contra ##vent ##ion of the purposes of the united nations organisation . [SEP]
[CLS] the united nations charter " re ##af ##firmed faith in fundamental human rights , and dignity and worth of the human person " and committed all member states to promote " universal respect for , and ob ##ser ##vance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion " . [SEP]
[CLS] when the atrocities committed by nazi germany became fully apparent after world war ii , the consensus within the world community was that the united nations charter did not sufficiently define the rights to which it referred . [SEP]
[CLS] a universal declaration that specified the rights of individuals was necessary to give effect to the charter ' s provisions on human rights . [SEP]
[CLS] the commission , a standing body of the united nations , was constituted to undertake the work of preparing what was initially conceived as an international bill of rights . [SEP]
[CLS] the commission established a special universal declaration of human rights drafting committee , chaired by eleanor roosevelt , to write the articles of the declaration . [SEP]
[CLS] canadian john peters humphrey , director of the division of human rights within the united nations secretariat , was called upon by the united nations secretary - general to work on the project and became the declaration ' s principal draft ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time , humphrey was newly appointed as director of the division of human rights within the united nations secretariat . [SEP]
[CLS] other well - known members of the drafting committee included rene cass ##in of france , charles malik of lebanon , and p . c . chang of the republic of china . [SEP]
[CLS] according to allan carlson , the declaration ' s pro - family phrases were the result of the christian democratic movement ' s influence on cass ##in and malik . [SEP]
[CLS] once the committee finished its work in may 1948 , the draft was further discussed by the commission on human rights , the economic and social council , the third committee of the general assembly before being put to vote in december 1948 . [SEP]
[CLS] the universal declaration was adopted by the general assembly as resolution 217 on 10 december 1948 in palais de cha ##illo ##t , paris , as the third united nations general assembly was held there . [SEP]
[CLS] south africa ' s position can be seen as an attempt to protect its system of apartheid , which clearly violated several articles in the declaration . [SEP]
[CLS] the saudi arabian delegation ' s abs ##ten ##tion was prompted primarily by two of the declaration ' s articles : article 18 , which states that everyone has the right " to change his religion or belief " ; and article 16 , on equal marriage rights . [SEP]
[CLS] eleanor roosevelt attributed the abs ##ten ##tion of soviet bloc countries to article 13 , which provided the right of citizens to leave their countries . [SEP]
[CLS] other countries only gained sovereignty and joined the united nations later , which explains the relatively small number of states entitled to the historical vote , and in no way reflects opposition to the universal principles . [SEP]
[CLS] the declaration of human rights day is commemorated every year on december 10 , the anniversary of the adoption of the universal declaration , and is known as human rights day or international human rights day . [SEP]
[CLS] dec ##ada ##l commemoration ##s are often accompanied by campaigns to promote awareness of the declaration and human rights . [SEP]
[CLS] 2008 marked the 60th anniversary of the declaration , and was accompanied by year - long activities around the theme " dignity and justice for all of us " . [SEP]
[CLS] eleanor roosevelt supported the adoption of the declaration as a declaration rather than as a treaty because she believed that it would have the same kind of influence on global society as the united states declaration of independence had within the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] for the first time in international law , the term “ the rule of law ” was used in the pre ##am ##ble of the declaration . [SEP]
[CLS] the third paragraph of the pre ##am ##ble of the declaration reads as follows : " whereas it is essential , if man is not to be compelled to have rec ##ours ##e , as a last resort , to rebellion against ty ##ran ##ny and oppression , that human rights should be protected by the rule of law . " [SEP]
[CLS] while not a treaty itself , the declaration was explicitly adopted for the purpose of defining the meaning of the words " fundamental freedoms " and " human rights " appearing in the united nations charter , which is binding on all member states . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1968 united nations international conference on human rights advised that the declaration " constitutes an obligation for the members of the international community " to all persons . [SEP]
[CLS] the declaration continues to be widely cited by governments , academics , advocates , and constitutional courts , and by individuals who appeal to its principles for the protection of their recognised human rights . [SEP]
[CLS] the lebanese philosopher and diplomat charles malik called it " an international document of the first order of importance " , while eleanor roosevelt — first chair ##woman of the commission on human rights ( ch ##r ) that drafted the declaration — stated that it " may well become the international magna cart ##a of all men everywhere . " [SEP]
[CLS] in a speech on 5 october 1995 , pope john paul ii called the declaration " one of the highest expressions of the human conscience of our time " but the vatican never adopted the declaration . [SEP]
[CLS] in a statement on 10 december 2003 on behalf of the european union , marcel ##lo spat ##af ##ora said that the declaration " placed human rights at the centre of the framework of principles and obligations shaping relations within the international community . " [SEP]
[CLS] however , the same year , saudi arabia abs ##tained from the ratification vote on the declaration , claiming that it violated sha ##ria law . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1982 , the iranian representative to the united nations , said raja ##ie - k ##hora ##ssa ##ni , said that the declaration was " a secular understanding of the jude ##o - christian tradition " , which could not be implemented by muslims without conflict with sha ##ria . [SEP]
[CLS] on 30 june 2000 , members of the organisation of the islamic conference ( now the organisation of islamic cooperation ) officially resolved to support the cairo declaration on human rights in islam , an alternative document that says people have " freedom and right to a dig ##nified life in accordance with the islamic sha ##ri ' ah " , without any discrimination on grounds of " race , colour , language , sex , religious belief , political affiliation , social status or other considerations " . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , iraqi diplomat bed ##ia af ##nan ' s insistence on word ##ing that recognized gender equality resulted in article 3 within the icc ##pr and ice ##sc ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] what needs to be pointed out to those who uphold the universal declaration of human rights to be the highest , or sole , model , of a charter of equality and liberty for all human beings , is that given the western origin and orientation of this declaration , the " universal ##ity " of the assumptions on which it is based isa ##t the very least ##pro ##ble ##matic and subject to questioning . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , the alleged inc ##omp ##ati ##bility between the concept of human rights and religion in general , or particular religions such as islam , needs to be examined in an un ##bia ##sed way . [SEP]
[CLS] ku ##tty writes : " a strong argument can be made that the current formulation of international human rights constitutes a cultural structure in which western society finds itself easily at home . . . [SEP]
[CLS] it is important to acknowledge and appreciate that other societies may have equally valid alternative conception ##s of human rights . " [SEP]
[CLS] ironically , a number of islamic countries that , as of 2014 , are among the most resistant to un intervention in domestic affairs , played an in ##val ##ua ##ble role in the creation of the declaration , with countries such as syria and egypt having been strong proponents of the universal ##ity of human rights and the right of countries to self - determination . [SEP]
[CLS] groups such as amnesty international and war resist ##ers international have advocated for " the right to refuse to kill " to be added to the universal declaration . [SEP]
[CLS] war resist ##ers international has stated that the right to con ##sc ##ient ##ious objection to military service is primarily derived from — but not yet explicit in — article 18 of the ud ##hr : the right to freedom of thought , conscience , and religion . [SEP]
[CLS] sean mac ##bri ##de — assistant secretary - general of the united nations and nobel peace prize laureate — has said : " to the rights en ##sh ##rine ##d in the universal declaration of human rights one more might , with relevance , be added . [SEP]
[CLS] the aaa warned that the document would be defining universal rights from a western paradigm which would be unfair to countries outside of that scope . [SEP]
[CLS] they proposed three notes for consideration with underlying themes of cultural re ##lat ##ivism : " 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] standards and values are relative to the culture from which they derive so that any attempt to formula ##te post ##ulates that grow out of the beliefs or moral codes of one culture must to that extent det ##rac ##t from the app ##lica ##bility of any declaration of human rights to mankind as a whole . " [SEP]
[CLS] during the lead up to the world conference on human rights held in 1993 , ministers from asian states adopted the bangkok declaration , re ##af ##firm ##ing their governments ' commitment to the principles of the united nations charter and the universal declaration of human rights . [SEP]
[CLS] they stated their view of the inter ##de ##pen ##den ##ce and ind ##iv ##isi ##bility of human rights and stressed the need for universal ##ity , object ##ivity , and non - select ##ivity of human rights . [SEP]
[CLS] however , at the same time , they emphasized the principles of sovereignty and non - interference , calling for greater emphasis on economic , social , and cultural rights — in particular , the right to economic development over civil and political rights . [SEP]
[CLS] the bangkok declaration is considered to be a landmark expression of the asian values perspective , which offers an extended critique of human rights universal ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] its article 5 simply mentions that " no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or de ##grad ##ing treatment or punishment . " [SEP]
[CLS] amnesty international celebrated human rights day and the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration all over the world by organizing the " fire up ! " [SEP]
[CLS] the quaker united nations office and the american friends service committee work on many human rights issues , including improving education on the universal declaration of human rights . [SEP]
[CLS] the purpose of y ##hri is to teach youth about human rights , specifically the united nations universal declaration of human rights , and inspire them to become advocates for tolerance and peace . [SEP]
