July 2 is the day of the year in the Gregorian calendar.
In a Common year of the Gregorian calendar, this date marks the half-way point of the year.
This would be at 12 noon (or 1 p.m. if Daylight Saving Time is used).
In a Leap year, the half-way point is at midnight between the 1 and 2 July (or 1 a.m. on July 2 if Daylight Saving Time is used).
Every year, this date falls on the same day of the week as New Year's Eve, and it also falls on the same day of the week as New Year's Day in Common years.
