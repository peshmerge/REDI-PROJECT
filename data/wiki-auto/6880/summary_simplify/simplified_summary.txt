a caesar salad is a green salad of romaine lettuce and croutons dressed with lemon juice nodes or lime juice ashore .
the salad is said to have been made by caesar cardini , an italian immigrant who operated restaurants in mexico and the united states .
cardini was living in san diego but also working in tijuana where cardini avoided the restrictions of prohibition .
in 1946 , newspaper columnist dorothy kilgallen wrote of a caesar containing anchovies , differing from cardini 's version : the big food rage in hollywood — the caesar salad — will be introduced to new yorkers by gilmore 's steak house .
the salad was later renamed to caesar 's salad .
cardini 's daughter said that the original recipe included whole lettuce leaves , which were meant to be lifted by the stem and eaten with the fingers ; coddled eggs ; and italian olive oil .
modern recipes typically include anchovies as a key ingredient .
the trademark brands " cardini 's " , " caesar cardini 's " and " the original caesar dressing " are all claimed to date to february 1950 , although they were only registered decades later , and more than a dozen varieties of bottled " cardini 's " dressing are available today , with various ingredients .
there are limitless other kinds of meat , including grilled chicken , or omitting ingredients such as anchovies and eggs .
salmonella bacteria are sometimes found in raw egg from cracked eggshells .
this is a concern with many similar dressings that are emulsified with eggs .
there are many variations of this salad .
