Sturgeon's science fiction novel "More Than Human" (1953) won the 1954 International Fantasy Award (for SF and fantasy) as the year's best novel and the Science Fiction Writers of America ranked "Baby is Three" number five among the "Greatest Science Fiction Novellas of All Time" to 1964.
Ranked by votes for all of their pre-1965 novellas, Sturgeon was second among authors, behind Robert Heinlein.
His name was legally changed to Theodore Sturgeon at age eleven after his mother's divorce and remarriage to William Dicky ("Argyll") Sturgeon.
His first genre story was "Ether Breather", published by John W. Campbell in the September 1939 issue of "Astounding Science Fiction".
At first he wrote mainly short stories, primarily for genre magazines such as "Astounding" and "Unknown", but also for general-interest publications such as "Argosy Magazine".
Sturgeon ghost-wrote one Ellery Queen mystery novel, "The Player on the Other Side" (Random House, 1963).
This novel gained critical praise from critic H. R. F. Keating: "I had almost finished writing "Crime and Mystery: the 100 Best Books", in which I had included "The Player on the Other Side" ... placing the book squarely in the Queen canon" when he learned that it had been written by Sturgeon.
Similarly, William DeAndrea, author and winner of Mystery Writers of America awards, selecting his ten favorite mystery novels for the magazine "Armchair Detective", picked "The Player on the Other Side" as one of them.
He said: "This book changed my life ... and made a raving mystery fan (and therefore ultimately a mystery writer) out of me.
Disliking arguments with Campbell over editorial decisions, after 1950 Sturgeon only published one story in "Astounding".
The latter is known for its invention of pon farr, the Vulcan mating ritual; first use of the sentence "Live long and prosper"; and first use of the Vulcan hand symbol.
Sturgeon is also sometimes credited as having deliberately put homosexual subtext in his work, like the back-rub scene in "Shore Leave", and the short story "The World Well Lost".
One of these was notable for having first introduced the Prime Directive.
He also wrote an episode of the Saturday morning show "Land of the Lost", "The Pylon Express", in 1975.
One, "A Saucer of Loneliness", was broadcast in 1986 and was dedicated to his memory.
was the inspiration for the 1970s made-for-TV movie, Marvel comic book, and alternative rock band of the same name.
Describing "To Here and the Easel" as "a stunning portrait of personality disassociation as perceived from the inside", Carl Sagan said that many of Sturgeon's works were among the "rare few science‐fiction novels that combine a standard science‐fiction theme with a deep human sensitivity".
John Clute wrote in "The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction": "His influence upon writers like Harlan Ellison and Samuel R. Delany was seminal, and in his life and work he was a powerful and generally liberating influence in post-WWII US sf".
He is not much known by the general public, however, and he won comparatively few awards.
His best work was published before the establishment and consolidation of the leading genre awards, while his later production was scarcer and weaker.
He was listed as a primary influence on the much more famous Ray Bradbury.
Though he continued to write through 1983, his work rate dipped noticeably in the later years of his life; a 1971 story collection entitled "Sturgeon Is Alive And Well" addressed Sturgeon's seeming withdrawal from the public eye in a tongue-in-cheek manner.
He died on May 8, 1985, of lung fibrosis, at Sacred Heart General Hospital in the neighboring city of Eugene.
He was a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the Trap Door Spiders, which served as the basis of Isaac Asimov's fictional group of mystery solvers the Black Widowers.
He represented this credo by the symbol of a Q with an arrow through it, an example of which he wore around his neck and used as part of his signature in the last 15 years of his life.
Sturgeon was a distant relative of Ralph Waldo Emerson, and through his Waldo, Hamilton Dicker and Dunn ancestors, a direct descendant of numerous influential Puritan, Presbyterian, and Anglican clergymen.
If Sturgeon was aware of much of his ancestry or stories associated with it, he never shared them with his friends or children, although the short "I Say—Ernest" (1972) does bring to life one wing of his ministerial family.
Sturgeon held a wide variety of jobs during his lifetime.
Theodore Sturgeon vividly recalled being in the same room with L. Ron Hubbard, when Hubbard became testy with someone there and retorted, "Y'know, we're all wasting our time writing this hack science fiction!
Sturgeon was married three times, had two long-term committed relationships outside of marriage, divorced once, and fathered a total of seven children.
His death from lung fibrosis may have been caused by exposure to asbestos during his Merchant Marine years.
Sturgeon published numerous short story collections during his lifetime, many drawing on his most prolific writing years of the 1940s and 1950s.
Note that some reprints of these titles (especially paperback editions) may cut one or two stories from the line-up.
Statistics herein refer to the original editions only.
However, some volumes did contain a few reprinted stories: this list includes books that collected only previously uncollected material, as well as those volumes that collected "mostly" new material, but also contained up to three stories (representing no more than half the book) that were previously published in a Sturgeon collection.
North Atlantic Books has released the chronologically assembled "The Complete Short Stories of Theodore Sturgeon", edited by Paul Williams, since 1994.
Extensive "Story Notes" are provided by Paul Williams and (in the last two volumes) Sturgeon's daughter Noël.
Sturgeon was best known for his short stories and novellas.
