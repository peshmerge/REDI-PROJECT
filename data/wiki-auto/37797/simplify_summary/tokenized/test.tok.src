[CLS] hilbert ' s paradox of the grand hotel ( col ##lo ##qui ##al : infinite hotel paradox or hilbert ' s hotel ) is a thought experiment which illustrates a counter ##int ##uit ##ive property of infinite sets . [SEP]
[CLS] it is demonstrated that a fully occupied hotel with infinitely many rooms may still accommodate additional guests , even infinitely many of them , and this process may be repeated infinitely often . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea was introduced by david hilbert in a 1924 lecture " uber das une ##nd ##liche " , reprinted in , and was popularized through george ga ##mo ##w ' s 1947 book " one two three . . . infinity " . [SEP]
[CLS] consider a hypothetical hotel with a count ##ably infinite number of rooms , all of which are occupied . [SEP]
[CLS] one might be tempted to think that the hotel would not be able to accommodate any newly arriving guests , as would be the case with a finite number of rooms , where the pigeon ##hole principle would apply . [SEP]
[CLS] suppose a new guest arrives and wishes to be accommodated in the hotel . [SEP]
[CLS] we can ( simultaneously ) move the guest currently in room 1 to room 2 , the guest currently in room 2 to room 3 , and so on , moving every guest from his current room " n " to room " n " + 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] after this , room 1 is empty and the new guest can be moved into that room . [SEP]
[CLS] by repeating this procedure , it is possible to make room for any finite number of new guests . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also possible to accommodate a " count ##ably infinite " number of new guests : just move the person occupying room 1 to room 2 , the guest occupying room 2 to room 4 , and , in general , the guest occupying room " n " to room 2 " n " ( 2 times " n " ) , and all the odd - numbered rooms ( which are count ##ably infinite ) will be free for the new guests . [SEP]
[CLS] it is possible to accommodate count ##ably infinitely many coach ##load ##s of count ##ably infinite passengers each , by several different methods . [SEP]
[CLS] most methods depend on the seats in the coaches being already numbered ( or use the ax ##iom of count ##able choice ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in general any pairing function can be used to solve this problem . [SEP]
[CLS] for each of these methods , consider a passenger ' s seat number on a coach to be formula _ 1 , and their coach number to be formula _ 2 , and the numbers formula _ 1 and formula _ 2 are then fed into the two arguments of the pairing function . [SEP]
[CLS] empty the odd numbered rooms by sending the guest in room formula _ 5 to room formula _ 6 , then put the first coach ' s load in rooms formula _ 7 , the second coach ' s load in rooms formula _ 8 ; for coach number formula _ 2 we use the rooms formula _ 10 where formula _ 11 is the formula _ 2 ##th odd prime number . [SEP]
[CLS] this solution leaves certain rooms empty ( which may or may not be useful to the hotel ) ; specifically , all odd numbers that are not prime powers , such as 15 or 84 ##7 , will no longer be occupied . [SEP]
[CLS] ( so , strictly speaking , this shows that the number of arrivals is " less than or equal to " the number of va ##can ##cies created . [SEP]
[CLS] it is easier to show , by an independent means , that the number of arrivals is also " greater than or equal to " the number of va ##can ##cies , and thus that they are " equal " , than to modify the algorithm to an exact fit . ) [SEP]
[CLS] ( the algorithm works equally well if one interchange ##s formula _ 1 and formula _ 2 , but whichever choice is made , it must be applied uniformly throughout . ) [SEP]
[CLS] you can put each person of a certain seat formula _ 15 and coach formula _ 2 into room formula _ 17 ( pre ##sum ##ing " c " = 0 for the people already in the hotel , 1 for the first coach , etc . . . . ) . [SEP]
[CLS] because every number has a unique prime factor ##ization , it ' s easy to see all people will have a room , while no two people will end up in the same room . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the person in room 259 ##2 ( formula _ 18 ) was sitting in on the 4th coach , on the 5th seat . [SEP]
[CLS] like the prime powers method , this solution leaves certain rooms empty . [SEP]
[CLS] this method can also easily be expanded for infinite nights , infinite entrances , etc . . . . ( formula _ 19 ) [SEP]
[CLS] for each passenger , compare the lengths of formula _ 1 and formula _ 2 as written in any position ##al nu ##meral system , such as decimal . [SEP]
[CLS] ( treat each hotel resident as being in coach # 0 . ) [SEP]
[CLS] if either number is shorter , add leading zero ##es to it until both values have the same number of digits . [SEP]
[CLS] inter ##lea ##ve the digits to produce a room number : its digits will be first digit of coach number - first digit of seat number - second digit of coach number - second digit of seat number - etc . [SEP]
[CLS] the hotel ( coach # 0 ) guest in room number 1729 moves to room 01 ##0 ##70 ##20 ##9 ( i . e . , room 1 , 07 ##0 , 209 . ) [SEP]
[CLS] the passenger on seat 123 ##4 of coach 78 ##9 goes to room 01 ##7 ##28 ##39 ##4 ( or just 1728 ##39 ##4 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike the prime powers solution , this one fills the hotel completely , and we can rec ##ons ##truct a guest ' s original coach and seat by rev ##ers ##ing the inter ##lea ##ving process . [SEP]
[CLS] first add a leading zero if the room has an odd number of digits . [SEP]
[CLS] then de - inter ##lea ##ve the number into two numbers : the seat number consists of the odd - numbered digits and the coach number is the even - numbered ones . [SEP]
[CLS] of course , the original encoding is arbitrary , and the roles of the two numbers can be reversed ( seat - odd and coach - even ) , so long as it is applied consistently . [SEP]
[CLS] those already in the hotel will be moved to room formula _ 22 , or the formula _ 1 ##th triangular number . [SEP]
[CLS] those in a coach will be in room formula _ 24 , or the formula _ 25 triangular number plus formula _ 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] in this way all the rooms will be filled by one , and only one , guest . [SEP]
[CLS] this pairing function can be demonstrated visually by st ##ru ##cturing the hotel as a one - room - deep , infinitely tall pyramid . [SEP]
[CLS] the pyramid ' s top ##most row is a single room : room 1 ; its second row is rooms 2 and 3 ; and so on . [SEP]
[CLS] the column formed by the set of right ##most rooms will correspond to the triangular numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] once they are filled ( by the hotel ' s red ##ist ##ri ##bu ##ted occupants ) , the remaining empty rooms form the shape of a pyramid exactly identical to the original shape . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the process can be repeated for each infinite set . [SEP]
[CLS] doing this one at a time for each coach would require an infinite number of steps , but by using the prior formulas , a guest can determine what his room " will be " once his coach has been reached in the process , and can simply go there immediately . [SEP]
[CLS] formula _ 28 is count ##able since formula _ 29 is count ##able , hence we may en ##ume ##rate its elements formula _ 30 . [SEP]
[CLS] now if formula _ 31 , assign the formula _ 32 ##th guest of the formula _ 33 ##th coach to the formula _ 1 ##th room ( consider the guests already in the hotel as guests of the formula _ 35th coach ) . [SEP]
[CLS] thus we have a function assign ##ing each person to a room ; furthermore , this assignment does not skip over any rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] suppose the hotel is next to an ocean , and an infinite number of car ferries arrive , each bearing an infinite number of coaches , each with an infinite number of passengers . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a situation involving three " levels " of infinity , and it can be solved by extensions of any of the previous solutions . [SEP]
[CLS] the prime factor ##ization method can be applied by adding a new prime number for every additional layer of infinity ( formula _ 36 , with formula _ 37 the ferry ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the prime power solution can be applied with further expo ##nent ##iation of prime numbers , resulting in very large room numbers even given small inputs . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the passenger in the second seat of the third bus on the second ferry ( address 2 - 3 - 2 ) would raise the 2nd odd prime ( 5 ) to 49 , which is the result of the 3rd odd prime ( 7 ) being raised to the power of his seat number ( 2 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this room number would have over thirty decimal digits . [SEP]
[CLS] the inter ##lea ##ving method can be used with three inter ##lea ##ved " strands " instead of two . [SEP]
[CLS] the passenger with the address 2 - 3 - 2 would go to room 232 , while the one with the address 49 ##35 - 198 - 82 ##21 ##7 would go to room # 00 ##8 , 402 , 91 ##2 , 39 ##1 , 58 ##7 ( the leading zero ##es can be removed ) . [SEP]
[CLS] anticipating the possibility of any number of layers of infinite guests , the hotel may wish to assign rooms such that no guest will need to move , no matter how many guests arrive afterward . [SEP]
[CLS] one solution is to convert each arrival ' s address into a binary number in which ones are used as sep ##arat ##ors at the start of each layer , while a number within a given layer ( such as a guests ' coach number ) is represented with that many zero ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , a guest with the prior address 2 - 5 - 1 - 3 - 1 ( five infinite layers ) would go to room 100 ##100 ##00 ##01 ##01 ##00 ##01 ##0 ( decimal 295 ##45 ##8 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] as an added step in this process , one zero can be removed from each section of the number ; in this example , the guest ' s new room is 101 ##00 ##00 ##11 ##00 ##1 ( decimal 258 ##5 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this ensures that every room could be filled by a hypothetical guest . [SEP]
[CLS] if no infinite sets of guests arrive , then only rooms that are a power of two will be occupied . [SEP]
[CLS] although a room can be found for any finite number of nest ##ed in ##fin ##ities of people , the same is not always true for an infinite number of layers , even if a finite number of elements exists at each layer . [SEP]
[CLS] the set of real numbers , and the set of guests in this example , is un ##co ##unt ##ably infinite . [SEP]
[CLS] because no one - to - one pairing can be made between count ##able and un ##co ##unt ##able sets , rooms at the hotel cannot be made for all of these guests , although any count ##ably infinite subset of them can still be accommodated . [SEP]
[CLS] if this variant is modified in certain ways , then the set of people is count ##able again . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , suppose there " were " a largest ship , directly containing a finite ( or count ##ably infinite ) number of both ships and people , and each of these ships in turn contained both ships and people , and so forth . [SEP]
[CLS] this time , any given person is a finite number of levels " down " from the top , and thus can be identified with a unique finite address . [SEP]
[CLS] the set of people is count ##able again , even if the total number of layers is infinite , because we do not have to consider an " in ##fin ##iti ##eth layer " in either direction . [SEP]
[CLS] hilbert ' s paradox is a ve ##rid ##ical paradox : it leads to a counter - intuitive result that is pro ##va ##bly true . [SEP]
[CLS] the statements " there is a guest to every room " and " no more guests can be accommodated " are not equivalent when there are infinitely many rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] initially , this state of affairs might seem to be counter - intuitive . [SEP]
[CLS] the properties of " infinite collections of things " are quite different from those of " finite collections of things " . [SEP]
[CLS] the paradox of hilbert ' s grand hotel can be understood by using cantor ' s theory of trans ##fin ##ite numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , while in an ordinary ( finite ) hotel with more than one room , the number of odd - numbered rooms is obviously smaller than the total number of rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in hilbert ' s apt ##ly named grand hotel , the quantity of odd - numbered rooms is not smaller than the total " number " of rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] in mathematical terms , the cardinal ##ity of the subset containing the odd - numbered rooms is the same as the cardinal ##ity of the set of all rooms . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , infinite sets are characterized as sets that have proper subset ##s of the same cardinal ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] for count ##able sets ( sets with the same cardinal ##ity as the natural numbers ) this cardinal ##ity is formula _ 38 . [SEP]
[CLS] rep ##hra ##sed , for any count ##ably infinite set , there exists a bi ##ject ##ive function which maps the count ##ably infinite set to the set of natural numbers , even if the count ##ably infinite set contains the natural numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the set of rational numbers — those numbers which can be written as a quo ##tie ##nt of integers — contains the natural numbers as a subset , but is no bigger than the set of natural numbers since the rational ##s are count ##able : there is a bi ##ject ##ion from the natural ##s to the rational ##s .
