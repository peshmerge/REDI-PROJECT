[CLS] the eighteenth amendment ( amendment xvi ##ii ) of the united states constitution established the prohibition of " into ##xi ##cating liquor ##s " in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] the amendment was proposed by congress on december 18 , 1917 , and was ratified by the re ##quisite number of states on january 16 , 1919 . [SEP]
[CLS] the eighteenth amendment was repealed by the twenty - first amendment on december 5 , 1933 . [SEP]
[CLS] the eighteenth amendment was the product of decades of efforts by the temperance movement , which held that a ban on the sale of alcohol would am ##eli ##ora ##te poverty and other societal issues . [SEP]
[CLS] the eighteenth amendment declared the production , transport , and sale of into ##xi ##cating liquor ##s illegal , though it did not outlaw the actual consumption of alcohol . [SEP]
[CLS] shortly after the amendment was ratified , congress passed the vols ##tead act to provide for the federal enforcement of prohibition . [SEP]
[CLS] the vols ##tead act declared that liquor , wine , and beer all qualified as into ##xi ##cating liquor ##s and were therefore prohibited . [SEP]
[CLS] under the terms of the eighteenth amendment , prohibition began on january 17 , 1920 , one year after the amendment was ratified . [SEP]
[CLS] although the eighteenth amendment led to a decline in alcohol consumption in the united states , nationwide enforcement of prohibition proved difficult , particularly in cities . [SEP]
[CLS] organized crime and other groups engaged in large - scale boot ##leg ##ging , and speak ##ea ##sies became popular in many areas . [SEP]
[CLS] public sentiment began to turn against prohibition during the 1920s , and 1932 democratic presidential nominee franklin d . roosevelt called for the repeal of the eighteenth amendment in his platform . [SEP]
[CLS] the twenty - first amendment repealed the eighteenth amendment in 1933 , making the eighteenth amendment the only amendment to the u . s . constitution ever to be repealed in its entirety . [SEP]
[CLS] the eighteenth amendment was the result of decades of effort by the temperance movement in the united states and at the time was generally considered a progressive amendment . [SEP]
[CLS] starting in 1906 , the anti - saloon league ( as ##l ) began leading a campaign to ban the sale of alcohol on a state level . [SEP]
[CLS] they led speeches , advertisements , and public demonstrations , claiming that banning the sale of alcohol would get rid of poverty and social issues , such as im ##moral behavior and violence . [SEP]
[CLS] it would also inspire new forms of soc ##ia ##bility between men and women and they believed that families would be happier , fewer industrial mistakes would be made and overall , the world would be a better place . [SEP]
[CLS] other groups such as the women ' s christian temperance union began as well trying to ban the sale , manufacturing , and distribution of alcoholic beverages . [SEP]
[CLS] a well - known reformer during this time period was carrie amelia moore nation , whose violent actions ( such as van ##dal ##izing saloon property ) made her a household name across america . [SEP]
[CLS] many state legislatures had already enacted statewide prohibition prior to the ratification of the eighteenth amendment but did not ban the consumption of alcohol in most households . [SEP]
[CLS] it took some states longer than others to rat ##ify this amendment , especially northern states , including new york , new jersey , and massachusetts . [SEP]
[CLS] they violated the law by still allowing some wines and beers to be sold . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1916 , 23 of 48 states had already passed laws against saloon ##s , some even banning the manufacture of alcohol in the first place . [SEP]
[CLS] the temperance movement was dedicated to the complete abs ##tine ##nce of alcohol from public life . [SEP]
[CLS] the movement began in the early 1800s within christian churches , and was very religious ##ly motivated . [SEP]
[CLS] the central areas the group was founded out of were in the saratoga area of new york , as well as in massachusetts . [SEP]
[CLS] churches were also highly influential in gaining new members and support , garner ##ing 6 , 000 local societies in several different states . [SEP]
[CLS] a group that was inspired by the movement was the anti - saloon league , who at the turn of the 20th century began heavily lobbying for prohibition in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] the group was founded in 1893 in the state of ohio , gaining massive support from evangelical protestants , to becoming a national organization in 1895 . [SEP]
[CLS] the group was successful in helping implement prohibition , through heavy lobbying and having a vast influence . [SEP]
[CLS] the group following repeal of prohibition fell out of power and in 1950 merged with other groups forming the national temperance league . [SEP]
[CLS] on august 1 , 1917 , the senate passed a resolution containing the language of the amendment to be presented to the states for ratification . [SEP]
[CLS] the vote was 65 to 20 , with the democrats voting 36 in favor and 12 in opposition ; and the republicans voting 29 in favor and 8 in opposition . [SEP]
[CLS] the house of representatives passed a revised resolution on december 17 , 1917 . [SEP]
[CLS] this was the first amendment to impose a date by which it had to be ratified or else the amendment would be discarded . [SEP]
[CLS] in the house , the vote was 282 to 128 , with the democrats voting 141 in favor and 64 in opposition ; and the republicans voting 137 in favor and 62 in opposition . [SEP]
[CLS] four independents in the house voted in favor and two independents cast votes against the amendment . [SEP]
[CLS] it was officially proposed by the congress to the states when the senate passed the resolution , by a vote of 47 to 8 , the next day , december 18 . [SEP]
[CLS] the amendment and its enabling legislation did not ban the consumption of alcohol , but made it difficult to obtain alcoholic beverages legally , as it prohibited the sale , manufacture and distribution of them in u . s . territory . [SEP]
[CLS] any one who got caught selling , manufacturing or distributing alcoholic beverages would be arrested . [SEP]
[CLS] because prohibition was already implemented by many states , it was quickly ratified into a law . [SEP]
[CLS] the ratification of the amendment was completed on january 16 , 1919 , when nebraska became the 36th of the 48 states then in the union to rat ##ify it . [SEP]
[CLS] on january 29 , acting secretary of state frank l . polk certified the ratification . [SEP]
[CLS] the following states rejected the amendment : to define the language used in the amendment , congress enacted enabling legislation called the national prohibition act , better known as the vols ##tead act , on october 28 , 1919 . [SEP]
[CLS] president woodrow wilson veto ##ed that bill , but the house of representatives immediately voted to over ##ride the veto and the senate voted similarly the next day . [SEP]
[CLS] the vols ##tead act set the starting date for nationwide prohibition for january 17 , 1920 , which was the earliest date allowed by the 18th amendment . [SEP]
[CLS] this act was conceived and introduced by wayne wheeler , a leader of the anti - saloon league , a group which found alcohol responsible for almost all of society ' s problems and which also ran many campaigns against the sale of alcohol . [SEP]
[CLS] the law was also heavily supported by then - judiciary chairman andrew vols ##tead from minnesota , and was named in his honor . [SEP]
[CLS] the act in its written form laid the ground ##work of prohibition , defining the procedures for banning the distribution of alcohol including their production and distribution . [SEP]
[CLS] vols ##tead had once before introduced an early version of the law to congress . [SEP]
[CLS] it was first brought to the floor on may 27 , 1919 , where it met heavy resistance from democratic senators . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , the so - called " wet law " was introduced , an attempt to end the wartime prohibition laws put into effect much earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] the debate over prohibition would rage for that entire session , as the house was divided among what would become known as the " bone - dry ##s " and the " wet ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] because republicans held the majority of the house of representatives , the vols ##tead act finally passed on july 22 , 1919 , with 287 in favor and 100 opposed . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the act was largely a failure , proving unable to prevent mass distribution of alcoholic beverages and also inadvertently causing a massive increase in organized crime . [SEP]
[CLS] the act would go on to define the terms and enforcement methods of prohibition , until the passing of the 21st amendment in 1933 effectively repealed it . [SEP]
[CLS] the proposed amendment was the first to contain a provision setting a deadline for its ratification . [SEP]
[CLS] that clause of the amendment was challenged , with the case reaching the us supreme court . [SEP]
[CLS] it upheld the constitutional ##ity of such a deadline in " dillon v . gloss " ( 1921 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court also upheld the ratification by the ohio legislature in " hawke v . smith " ( 1920 ) , despite a petition requiring that the matter go to ballot . [SEP]
[CLS] this was not the only controversy around the amendment . [SEP]
[CLS] the phrase " into ##xi ##cating liquor " would not logical ##ly have included beer and wine ( as they are not di ##sti ##lled ) , and their inclusion in the prohibition came as a surprise to the general public , as well as wine and beer makers . [SEP]
[CLS] this controversy caused many northern states to not ab ##ide by which caused some problems . [SEP]
[CLS] the brewers were probably not the only americans to be surprised at the severity of the regime thus created . [SEP]
[CLS] voters who considered their own drinking habits blame ##less , but who supported prohibition to discipline others , also received a rude shock . [SEP]
[CLS] that shock came with the realization that federal prohibition went much farther in the direction of banning personal consumption than all local prohibition ordinance ##s and many state prohibition statutes . [SEP]
[CLS] national prohibition turned out to be quite a different beast than its local and state cousins . [SEP]
[CLS] under prohibition , the illegal manufacture and sale of liquor – known as " boot ##leg ##ging " – occurred on a large scale across the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] in urban areas , where the majority of the population opposed prohibition , enforcement was generally much weaker than in rural areas and smaller towns . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps the most dramatic consequence of prohibition was the effect it had on organized crime in the united states : as the production and sale of alcohol went further underground , it began to be controlled by the mafia and other gangs , who transformed themselves into sophisticated criminal enterprises that re ##ape ##d huge profits from the illicit liquor trade . [SEP]
[CLS] when it came to its booming boot ##leg business , the mafia became skilled at br ##ib ##ing police and politicians to look the other way . [SEP]
[CLS] chicago ' s al cap ##one emerged as the most notorious example of this phenomenon , earning an estimated $ 60 million annually from the boot ##leg ##ging and speak ##ea ##sy operations he controlled . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to boot ##leg ##ging , gambling and prostitution reached new heights during the 1920s as well . [SEP]
[CLS] a growing number of americans came to blame prohibition for this widespread moral decay and disorder – despite the fact that the legislation had intended to do the opposite – and to condemn it as a dangerous infringement on the freedom of the individual . [SEP]
[CLS] five distinct , if occasionally overlapping , components made up this unspoken coalition : racist ##s , progressive ##s , su ##ff ##rag ##ists , pop ##uli ##sts ( whose ranks included a small socialist auxiliary ) , and nat ##ivist ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] adherents of each group may have been opposed to alcohol for its own sake , but used the prohibition impulse to advance id ##eo ##logies and causes that had little to do with it . [SEP]
[CLS] if public sentiment had turned against prohibition by the late 1920s , the great depression only haste ##ned its demise , as some argued that the ban on alcohol denied jobs to the unemployed and much - needed revenue to the government . [SEP]
[CLS] the efforts of the non ##partisan group americans against prohibition association ( aa ##pa ) added to public di ##sil ##lusion ##ment . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1932 , the platform of democratic presidential candidate franklin d . roosevelt included a plank for repeal ##ing the 18th amendment , and his victory that november marked a certain end to prohibition . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 1933 , congress adopted a resolution proposing the twenty - first amendment , which repealed the 18th amendment and modified the vols ##tead act to permit the sale of beer . [SEP]
[CLS] the resolution required state conventions , rather than the state legislatures , to approve the amendment , effectively reducing the process to a one - state , one - vote referendum rather than a popular vote contest . [SEP]
[CLS] that december , utah became the 36th state to rat ##ify the amendment , achieving the necessary majority for repeal . [SEP]
[CLS] a few states continued statewide prohibition after 1933 , but by 1966 all of them had abandoned it . [SEP]
[CLS] since then , liquor control in the united states has largely been determined at the local level . [SEP]
[CLS] just after the eighteenth amendment ' s adoption , there was a significant reduction in alcohol consumption among the general public and particularly among low - income groups . [SEP]
[CLS] there were fewer hospital ##izations for alcoholism and likewise fewer liver - related medical problems . [SEP]
[CLS] however , consumption soon climbed as underworld entrepreneurs began producing " rot ##gut " alcohol which was full of dangerous diseases . [SEP]
[CLS] with the rise of home di ##sti ##lled alcohol , careless di ##sti ##lling led to the deaths of many citizens . [SEP]
[CLS] during the ban upwards of 10 , 000 deaths can be attributed to wood alcohol ( met ##han ##ol ) poisoning . [SEP]
[CLS] ultimately , during prohibition use and abuse of alcohol ended up higher than before it started . [SEP]
[CLS] the greatest un ##int ##ended consequence of prohibition however , was the plain ##est to see . [SEP]
[CLS] for over a decade , the law that was meant to foster temperance instead foster ##ed int ##em ##per ##ance and excess . [SEP]
[CLS] the solution the united states had devised to address the problem of alcohol abuse had instead made the problem even worse . [SEP]
[CLS] the statistics of the period are notorious ##ly unreliable , but it is very clear that in many parts of the united states more people were drinking , and people were drinking more . [SEP]
[CLS] though there were significant increases in crimes involved in the production and distribution of illegal alcohol , there was an initial reduction in overall crime , mainly in types of crimes associated with the effects of alcohol consumption such as public drunken ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] those who continued to use alcohol , tended to turn to organized criminal syndicate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] law enforcement wasn ' t strong enough to stop all liquor traffic ; however , they used " sting " operations , such as prohibition agent eliot ness famously using wire ##ta ##pping to disc ##ern secret locations of brewer ##ies . [SEP]
[CLS] the prisons became crowded which led to fewer arrests for the distribution of alcohol , as well as those arrested being charged with small fines rather than prison time . [SEP]
[CLS] the murder rate fell for two years , but then rose to record highs because this market became extremely attractive to criminal organizations , a trend that reversed the very year prohibition ended . [SEP]
[CLS] the homicide rate increased from 6 per 100 , 000 population in the pre - prohibition period to nearly 10 per 100 , 000 in 1933 . [SEP]
[CLS] that rising trend was reversed by the repeal of prohibition in 1933 , and the rate continued to decline throughout the 1930s and early 1940s . [SEP]
[CLS] overall , crime rose 24 % , including increases in assault and battery , theft , and bu ##rg ##lary . [SEP]
[CLS] anti - prohibition groups arose and worked to have the amendment repealed , once it became apparent that prohibition was an unprecedented catastrophe . [SEP]
[CLS] it is alleged that the eighteenth amendment failed because of its sudden , strict enforcement . [SEP]
[CLS] it didn ' t allow the people to have a say or let them gradually ease into the complete ban of alcoholic beverages . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , the people rebelled and the introduction of speak ##ea ##sies and " flap ##pers " came about . [SEP]
[CLS] the twenty - first amendment repealed the eighteenth amendment on december 5 , 1933 . [SEP]
[CLS] following ratification in 1919 , the amendment ' s effects were long lasting , leading to increases in crime in many large cities in the united states , like chicago , new york , and los angeles . [SEP]
[CLS] along with this came many separate forms of illegal alcohol distribution . [SEP]
[CLS] examples of this include speak ##ea ##sies and boot ##leg ##ging , as well as illegal di ##sti ##lling operations . [SEP]
[CLS] boot ##leg ##ging got its start in towns bordering mexico and canada , as well as in areas with several ports and harbor ##s , a favorite distribution area for boot ##leg ##gers being atlantic city , new jersey . [SEP]
[CLS] the alcohol was often supplied from various foreign distributors , like cuba and the bahamas , or even newfoundland and islands under rule by the french . [SEP]
[CLS] the government in response employed the coast guard to search and det ##ain any ships transporting alcohol into the ports , but with this came several complications such as disputes over where jurisdiction lay on the water . [SEP]
[CLS] this was what made atlantic city such a hot spot for smuggling operations , because of a shipping point nearly three miles off shore that u . s . officials could not investigate , further com ##pl ##ica ##ting enforcement of the amendment . [SEP]
[CLS] what made matters even worse for the coast guard was that they were not well equipped enough to chase down boot ##leg ##ging vessels . [SEP]
[CLS] the coast guard however , was able to respond to these issues , and began searching vessels out at sea , instead of when they made port , and upgraded their own vehicles allowing for more efficient and consistent arrests . [SEP]
[CLS] but even with those advancement ##s in enforcing the amendment , there were still complications that plagued the government ' s efforts . [SEP]
[CLS] one issue came in the form of forged prescription ##s for alcoholic beverages . [SEP]
[CLS] many forms of alcohol were being sold over the counter at the time , under the guise of being for medical purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] but in truth , these beverages had fa ##ls ##ified the evidence that they were medical ##ly fit to be sold to consumers . [SEP]
[CLS] boot ##leg ##ging itself was the leading factor that developed the organized crime - rings in big cities , given that controlling and distributing liquor was a very difficult task to achieve . [SEP]
[CLS] from that arose many profitable gangs that would control every aspect of the distribution process , whether it be concealed brewing and storage , operating a speak ##ea ##sy , or selling in restaurants and nightclub ##s run by a specific syndicate . [SEP]
[CLS] with organized crime becoming a rising problem in the united states , control of specific territories was a key objective among gangs , leading to many violent confrontation ##s ; as a result , murder rates and bu ##rg ##lar ##ies heavily increased between 1920 and 1933 . [SEP]
[CLS] boot ##leg ##ging was also found to be a gateway crime for many gangs , who would then expand operations into crimes such as prostitution , gambling rack ##ets , narcotics , loan - shark ##ing , ex ##tort ##ion and labor rack ##ets , thus causing problems to persist long after the amendment was repealed .
