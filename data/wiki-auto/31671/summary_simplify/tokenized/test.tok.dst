[CLS] the eighteenth amendment was the product of decades of efforts by the temperance movement , which held that a ban on the sale of alcohol would am ##eli ##ora ##te poverty and other societal issues . [SEP]
[CLS] shortly after the amendment was ratified , congress passed the vols ##tead act to provide for the federal enforcement of prohibition . [SEP]
[CLS] the vols ##tead act declared that liquor , wine , and beer all qualified as into ##xi ##cating liquor ##s and were therefore prohibited . [SEP]
[CLS] although the eighteenth amendment led to a decline in alcohol consumption in the united states , nationwide enforcement of prohibition proved difficult , particularly in cities . [SEP]
[CLS] public sentiment began to turn against prohibition during the 1920s , and 1932 democratic presidential nominee franklin d . roosevelt called for the repeal of the eighteenth amendment in his platform . [SEP]
[CLS] they led speeches , advertisements , and public demonstrations , claiming that banning the sale of alcohol would get rid of poverty and social issues , such as im ##moral behavior and violence . [SEP]
[CLS] other groups such as the women ' s christian temperance union began as well trying to ban the sale , manufacturing , and distribution of alcoholic beverages . [SEP]
[CLS] a well - known reformer during this time period was carrie amelia moore nation , whose violent actions ( such as van ##dal ##izing saloon property ) made her a household name across america . [SEP]
[CLS] many state legislatures had already enacted statewide prohibition prior to the ratification of the eighteenth amendment but did not ban the consumption of alcohol in most households . [SEP]
[CLS] it took some states longer than others to rat ##ify this amendment , especially northern states , including new york , new jersey , and massachusetts . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1916 , 23 of 48 states had already passed laws against saloon ##s , some even banning the manufacture of alcohol in the first place . [SEP]
[CLS] the movement began in the early 1800s within christian churches , and was very religious ##ly motivated . [SEP]
[CLS] the central areas the group was founded out of were in the saratoga area of new york , as well as in massachusetts . [SEP]
[CLS] churches were also highly influential in gaining new members and support , garner ##ing 6 , 000 local societies in several different states . [SEP]
[CLS] a group that was inspired by the movement was the anti - saloon league , who at the turn of the 20th century began heavily lobbying for prohibition in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] the group following repeal of prohibition fell out of power and in 1950 merged with other groups forming the national temperance league . [SEP]
[CLS] on august 1 , 1917 , the senate passed a resolution containing the language of the amendment to be presented to the states for ratification . [SEP]
[CLS] it was officially proposed by the congress to the states when the senate passed the resolution , by a vote of 47 to 8 , the next day , december 18 . [SEP]
[CLS] the amendment and its enabling legislation did not ban the consumption of alcohol , but made it difficult to obtain alcoholic beverages legally , as it prohibited the sale , manufacture and distribution of them in u . s . territory . [SEP]
[CLS] because prohibition was already implemented by many states , it was quickly ratified into a law . [SEP]
[CLS] the ratification of the amendment was completed on january 16 , 1919 , when nebraska became the 36th of the 48 states then in the union to rat ##ify it . [SEP]
[CLS] the following states rejected the amendment : to define the language used in the amendment , congress enacted enabling legislation called the national prohibition act , better known as the vols ##tead act , on october 28 , 1919 . [SEP]
[CLS] the vols ##tead act set the starting date for nationwide prohibition for january 17 , 1920 , which was the earliest date allowed by the 18th amendment . [SEP]
[CLS] this act was conceived and introduced by wayne wheeler , a leader of the anti - saloon league , a group which found alcohol responsible for almost all of society ' s problems and which also ran many campaigns against the sale of alcohol . [SEP]
[CLS] the law was also heavily supported by then - judiciary chairman andrew vols ##tead from minnesota , and was named in his honor . [SEP]
[CLS] vols ##tead had once before introduced an early version of the law to congress . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , the so - called " wet law " was introduced , an attempt to end the wartime prohibition laws put into effect much earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] the debate over prohibition would rage for that entire session , as the house was divided among what would become known as the " bone - dry ##s " and the " wet ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] because republicans held the majority of the house of representatives , the vols ##tead act finally passed on july 22 , 1919 , with 287 in favor and 100 opposed . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the act was largely a failure , proving unable to prevent mass distribution of alcoholic beverages and also inadvertently causing a massive increase in organized crime . [SEP]
[CLS] the act would go on to define the terms and enforcement methods of prohibition , until the passing of the 21st amendment in 1933 effectively repealed it . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court also upheld the ratification by the ohio legislature in " hawke v . smith " ( 1920 ) , despite a petition requiring that the matter go to ballot . [SEP]
[CLS] the phrase " into ##xi ##cating liquor " would not logical ##ly have included beer and wine ( as they are not di ##sti ##lled ) , and their inclusion in the prohibition came as a surprise to the general public , as well as wine and beer makers . [SEP]
[CLS] this controversy caused many northern states to not ab ##ide by which caused some problems . [SEP]
[CLS] voters who considered their own drinking habits blame ##less , but who supported prohibition to discipline others , also received a rude shock . [SEP]
[CLS] in urban areas , where the majority of the population opposed prohibition , enforcement was generally much weaker than in rural areas and smaller towns . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps the most dramatic consequence of prohibition was the effect it had on organized crime in the united states : as the production and sale of alcohol went further underground , it began to be controlled by the mafia and other gangs , who transformed themselves into sophisticated criminal enterprises that re ##ape ##d huge profits from the illicit liquor trade . [SEP]
[CLS] chicago ' s al cap ##one emerged as the most notorious example of this phenomenon , earning an estimated $ 60 million annually from the boot ##leg ##ging and speak ##ea ##sy operations he controlled . [SEP]
[CLS] a growing number of americans came to blame prohibition for this widespread moral decay and disorder – despite the fact that the legislation had intended to do the opposite – and to condemn it as a dangerous infringement on the freedom of the individual . [SEP]
[CLS] adherents of each group may have been opposed to alcohol for its own sake , but used the prohibition impulse to advance id ##eo ##logies and causes that had little to do with it . [SEP]
[CLS] if public sentiment had turned against prohibition by the late 1920s , the great depression only haste ##ned its demise , as some argued that the ban on alcohol denied jobs to the unemployed and much - needed revenue to the government . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1932 , the platform of democratic presidential candidate franklin d . roosevelt included a plank for repeal ##ing the 18th amendment , and his victory that november marked a certain end to prohibition . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 1933 , congress adopted a resolution proposing the twenty - first amendment , which repealed the 18th amendment and modified the vols ##tead act to permit the sale of beer . [SEP]
[CLS] just after the eighteenth amendment ' s adoption , there was a significant reduction in alcohol consumption among the general public and particularly among low - income groups . [SEP]
[CLS] ultimately , during prohibition use and abuse of alcohol ended up higher than before it started . [SEP]
[CLS] the statistics of the period are notorious ##ly unreliable , but it is very clear that in many parts of the united states more people were drinking , and people were drinking more . [SEP]
[CLS] though there were significant increases in crimes involved in the production and distribution of illegal alcohol , there was an initial reduction in overall crime , mainly in types of crimes associated with the effects of alcohol consumption such as public drunken ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] those who continued to use alcohol , tended to turn to organized criminal syndicate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] law enforcement wasn ' t strong enough to stop all liquor traffic ; however , they used " sting " operations , such as prohibition agent eliot ness famously using wire ##ta ##pping to disc ##ern secret locations of brewer ##ies . [SEP]
[CLS] the prisons became crowded which led to fewer arrests for the distribution of alcohol , as well as those arrested being charged with small fines rather than prison time . [SEP]
[CLS] that rising trend was reversed by the repeal of prohibition in 1933 , and the rate continued to decline throughout the 1930s and early 1940s . [SEP]
[CLS] the alcohol was often supplied from various foreign distributors , like cuba and the bahamas , or even newfoundland and islands under rule by the french . [SEP]
[CLS] the government in response employed the coast guard to search and det ##ain any ships transporting alcohol into the ports , but with this came several complications such as disputes over where jurisdiction lay on the water . [SEP]
[CLS] this was what made atlantic city such a hot spot for smuggling operations , because of a shipping point nearly three miles off shore that u . s . officials could not investigate , further com ##pl ##ica ##ting enforcement of the amendment . [SEP]
[CLS] what made matters even worse for the coast guard was that they were not well equipped enough to chase down boot ##leg ##ging vessels . [SEP]
[CLS] the coast guard however , was able to respond to these issues , and began searching vessels out at sea , instead of when they made port , and upgraded their own vehicles allowing for more efficient and consistent arrests . [SEP]
[CLS] but even with those advancement ##s in enforcing the amendment , there were still complications that plagued the government ' s efforts . [SEP]
[CLS] many forms of alcohol were being sold over the counter at the time , under the guise of being for medical purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] boot ##leg ##ging itself was the leading factor that developed the organized crime - rings in big cities , given that controlling and distributing liquor was a very difficult task to achieve . [SEP]
[CLS] from that arose many profitable gangs that would control every aspect of the distribution process , whether it be concealed brewing and storage , operating a speak ##ea ##sy , or selling in restaurants and nightclub ##s run by a specific syndicate . [SEP]
[CLS] with organized crime becoming a rising problem in the united states , control of specific territories was a key objective among gangs , leading to many violent confrontation ##s ; as a result , murder rates and bu ##rg ##lar ##ies heavily increased between 1920 and 1933 . [SEP]
[CLS] boot ##leg ##ging was also found to be a gateway crime for many gangs , who would then expand operations into crimes such as prostitution , gambling rack ##ets , narcotics , loan - shark ##ing , ex ##tort ##ion and labor rack ##ets , thus causing problems to persist long after the amendment was repealed .
