A phenotypic trait, simply trait, or character state is a distinct variant of a phenotypic characteristic of an organism; it may be either inherited or determined environmentally, but typically occurs as a combination of the two.
Underlying genes, which make up the genotype, determine the hair color, but the hair color observed is the phenotype.
The phenotype is dependent on the genetic make-up of the organism, and also influenced by the environmental conditions to which the organism is subjected across its ontogenetic development, including various epigenetic processes.
Regardless of the degree of influence of genotype versus environment, the phenotype encompasses all of the characteristics of an organism, including traits at multiple levels of biological organization, ranging from behavior and evolutionary history of life traits (e.g., litter size), through morphology (e.g., body height and composition), physiology (e.g., blood pressure), cellular characteristics (e.g., membrane lipid composition, mitochondrial densities), components of biochemical pathways, and even messenger RNA.
The inheritable unit that may influence a trait is called a gene.
An important reference point along a chromosome is the centromere; the distance from a gene to the centromere is referred to as the gene's locus or map location.
Different phenotypic traits are caused by different forms of genes, or alleles, which arise by mutation in a single individual and are passed on to successive generations.
A gene is only a DNA code sequence; the slightly different variations of that sequence are called alleles.
For example, if the alleles on homologous chromosomes exhibit a "simple dominance" relationship, the trait of the "dominant" allele shows in the phenotype.
His most famous analyses were based on clear-cut traits with simple dominance.
He determined that the heritable units, what we now call genes, occurred in pairs.
Thus you can tell that each allele is present in the heterozygote.
Codominance refers to the allelic relationship that occurs when two alleles are both expressed in the heterozygote, and both phenotypes are seen simultaneously.
Multiple alleles refers to the situation when there are more than 2 common alleles of a particular gene.
The ABO blood group proteins are important in determining blood type in humans, and this is determined by different alleles of the one locus.
Studies have shown that gender and age influences the expression of schizotypal traits.
For instance, certain schizotypal traits may develop further during adolescence, whereas others stay the same during this period.
