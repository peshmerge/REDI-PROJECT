[CLS] a ph ##eno ##typic trait , simply trait , or character state is a distinct variant of a ph ##eno ##typic characteristic of an organism ; it may be either inherited or determined environmentally , but typically occurs as a combination of the two . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , eye color is a character of an organism , while blue , brown and hazel are " traits " . [SEP]
[CLS] a ph ##eno ##typic trait is an obvious , ob ##ser ##vable , and me ##asurable trait ; it is the expression of genes in an ob ##ser ##vable way . [SEP]
[CLS] an example of a ph ##eno ##typic trait is hair color . [SEP]
[CLS] underlying genes , which make up the gen ##otype , determine the hair color , but the hair color observed is the ph ##eno ##type . [SEP]
[CLS] the ph ##eno ##type is dependent on the genetic make - up of the organism , and also influenced by the environmental conditions to which the organism is subjected across its onto ##gen ##etic development , including various ep ##igen ##etic processes . [SEP]
[CLS] regardless of the degree of influence of gen ##otype versus environment , the ph ##eno ##type encompasses all of the characteristics of an organism , including traits at multiple levels of biological organization , ranging from behavior and evolutionary history of life traits ( e . g . , litter size ) , through morphology ( e . g . , body height and composition ) , physiology ( e . g . , blood pressure ) , cellular characteristics ( e . g . , membrane lip ##id composition , mitochondrial den ##sities ) , components of bio ##chemical pathways , and even messenger rna . [SEP]
[CLS] the inherit ##able unit that may influence a trait is called a gene . [SEP]
[CLS] a gene is a portion of a chromosome , which is a very long and compact ##ed string of dna and proteins . [SEP]
[CLS] an important reference point along a chromosome is the centro ##mere ; the distance from a gene to the centro ##mere is referred to as the gene ' s locus or map location . [SEP]
[CLS] the nucleus of a dip ##loid cell contains two of each chromosome , with homo ##log ##ous ( mostly identical ) pairs of chromosomes having the same genes at the same lo ##ci . [SEP]
[CLS] different ph ##eno ##typic traits are caused by different forms of genes , or all ##eles , which arise by mutation in a single individual and are passed on to successive generations . [SEP]
[CLS] a gene is only a dna code sequence ; the slightly different variations of that sequence are called all ##eles . [SEP]
[CLS] all ##eles can be significantly different and produce different product rna ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] combinations of different all ##eles thus go on to generate different traits through the information flow charted above . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , if the all ##eles on homo ##log ##ous chromosomes exhibit a " simple dominance " relationship , the trait of the " dominant " all ##ele shows in the ph ##eno ##type . [SEP]
[CLS] gregor men ##del pioneered modern genetics . [SEP]
[CLS] his most famous analyses were based on clear - cut traits with simple dominance . [SEP]
[CLS] he determined that the her ##ita ##ble units , what we now call genes , occurred in pairs . [SEP]
[CLS] his tool was statistics . [SEP]
[CLS] the biochemistry of the intermediate proteins determines how they interact in the cell . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , biochemistry predict ##s how different combinations of all ##eles will produce varying traits . [SEP]
[CLS] extended expression patterns seen in dip ##loid organisms include face ##ts of incomplete dominance , cod ##omi ##nan ##ce , and multiple all ##eles . [SEP]
[CLS] incomplete dominance is the condition in which neither all ##ele dominates the other in one het ##ero ##zy ##go ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] instead the ph ##eno ##type is intermediate in het ##ero ##zy ##go ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] thus you can tell that each all ##ele is present in the het ##ero ##zy ##go ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] cod ##omi ##nan ##ce refers to the all ##eli ##c relationship that occurs when two all ##eles are both expressed in the het ##ero ##zy ##go ##te , and both ph ##eno ##type ##s are seen simultaneously . [SEP]
[CLS] multiple all ##eles refers to the situation when there are more than 2 common all ##eles of a particular gene . [SEP]
[CLS] blood groups in humans is a classic example . [SEP]
[CLS] the ab ##o blood group proteins are important in determining blood type in humans , and this is determined by different all ##eles of the one locus . [SEP]
[CLS] sc ##hi ##zo ##ty ##py is an example of a psychological ph ##eno ##typic trait found in schizophrenia - spectrum disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] studies have shown that gender and age influences the expression of sc ##hi ##zo ##ty ##pal traits . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , certain sc ##hi ##zo ##ty ##pal traits may develop further during adolescence , whereas others stay the same during this period . [SEP]
