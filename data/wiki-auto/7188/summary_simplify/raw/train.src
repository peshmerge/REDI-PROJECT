It was discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Mount Wilson Observatory in California in July 1938.
It is named after the mythological Carme, mother by Zeus of Britomartis, a Cretan goddess.
Carme did not receive its present name until 1975; before then, it was simply known as Jupiter XI .
It gives its name to the Carme group, made up of irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23 and 24 Gm and at an inclination of about 165Â°.
They are continuously changing due to solar and planetary perturbations.
