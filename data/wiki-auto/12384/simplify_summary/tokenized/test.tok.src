[CLS] the gettysburg address is a speech that u . s . president abraham lincoln delivered during the american civil war at the dedication of the soldiers ' national cemetery in gettysburg , pennsylvania , on the afternoon of thursday , november 19 , 1863 , four and a half months after the union armies defeated those of the confederacy at the battle of gettysburg . [SEP]
[CLS] it is one of the best - known speeches in american history . [SEP]
[CLS] not even the day ' s primary speech , lincoln ' s carefully crafted address came to be seen as one of the greatest and most influential statements of american national purpose . [SEP]
[CLS] in just 271 words , beginning with the now iconic phrase " four score and seven years ago , " referring to the signing of the declaration of independence 87 years earlier , lincoln described the us as a nation " conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal , " and represented the civil war as a test that would determine whether such a nation , the union sun ##der ##ed by the secession crisis , could endure . [SEP]
[CLS] he ex ##to ##lled the sacrifices of those who died at gettysburg in defense of those principles , and ex ##hort ##ed his listeners to resolve [SEP]
[CLS] despite the prominent place of the speech in the history and popular culture of the united states , its exact word ##ing is disputed . [SEP]
[CLS] the five known manuscripts of the gettysburg address in lincoln ' s hand differ in a number of details , and also differ from contemporary newspaper reprint ##s of the speech . [SEP]
[CLS] neither is it clear where stood the platform from which lincoln delivered the address . [SEP]
[CLS] modern scholarship locate ##s the speakers ' platform 40 yards ( or more ) away from the traditional site in soldiers ' national cemetery at the soldiers ' national monument , such that it stood entirely within the private , adjacent evergreen cemetery . [SEP]
[CLS] following the battle of gettysburg on july 1 – 3 , 1863 , the removal of the fallen union soldiers from the gettysburg battlefield graves and their re ##bu ##rial in graves at the national cemetery at gettysburg began on october 17 . [SEP]
[CLS] in inviting president lincoln to the ceremonies , david wills , of the committee for the november 19 consecration of the national cemetery at gettysburg , wrote , " it is the desire that , after the or ##ation , you , as chief executive of the nation , formally set apart these grounds to their sacred use by a few appropriate remarks . " [SEP]
[CLS] on the train trip from washington , d . c . , to gettysburg on november 18 , lincoln was accompanied by three members of his cabinet , william se ##ward , john usher and montgomery blair , several foreign officials , his secretary john nicola ##y , and his assistant secretary , john hay . [SEP]
[CLS] during the trip lincoln remarked to hay that he felt weak ; on the morning of november 19 , lincoln mentioned to nicola ##y that he was dizzy . [SEP]
[CLS] hay noted that during the speech lincoln ' s face had " a g ##has ##tly color " and that he was " sad , mo ##urn ##ful , almost haggard . " [SEP]
[CLS] after the speech , when lincoln boarded the 6 : 30 pm train for washington , d . c . , he was fever ##ish and weak , with a severe headache . [SEP]
[CLS] a pro ##tracted illness followed , which included a ve ##sic ##ular rash ; it was diagnosed as a mild case of smallpox . [SEP]
[CLS] it thus seems highly likely that lincoln was in the pro ##dro ##mal period of smallpox when he delivered the gettysburg address . [SEP]
[CLS] while it is lincoln ' s short speech that has gone down in history as one of the finest examples of english public or ##atory , it was everett ' s two - hour or ##ation that was slated to be the " gettysburg address " that day . [SEP]
[CLS] standing beneath this serene sky , overlooking these broad fields now rep ##osing from the labor ##s of the wan ##ing year , the mighty all ##eg ##hen ##ies dimly towering before us , the graves of our brethren beneath our feet , it is with hesitation that i raise my poor voice to break the el ##o ##quent silence of god and nature . [SEP]
[CLS] but the duty to which you have called me must be performed ; — grant me , i pray you , your ind ##ul ##gence and your sympathy . [SEP]
[CLS] but they , i am sure , will join us in saying , as we bid farewell to the dust of these martyr - heroes , that where ##so ##ever throughout the civilized world the accounts of this great warfare are read , and down to the latest period of recorded time , in the glorious annals of our common country , there will be no brighter page than that which relates the battles of gettysburg . [SEP]
[CLS] lengthy dedication addresses like everett ' s were common at cemeteries in this era . [SEP]
[CLS] the tradition began in 1831 when justice joseph story delivered the dedication address at mount auburn cemetery in cambridge , massachusetts . [SEP]
[CLS] those addresses often linked cemeteries to the mission of union . [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln ' s address followed the or ##ation by edward everett , who subsequently included a copy of the gettysburg address in his 1864 book about the event ( " address of the hon . edward everett at the consecration of the national cemetery at gettysburg , 19th november 1863 , with the de ##dic ##atory speech of president lincoln , and the other exercises of the occasion ; accompanied by an account of the origin of the undertaking and of the arrangement of the cemetery grounds , and by a map of the battle - field and a plan of the cemetery " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] shortly after everett ' s well - received remarks , lincoln spoke for only a few minutes . [SEP]
[CLS] with a " few appropriate remarks " , he was able to sum ##mar ##ize his view of the war in just ten sentences . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the historical significance of lincoln ' s speech , modern scholars disagree as to its exact word ##ing , and contemporary transcription ##s published in newspaper accounts of the event and even hand ##written copies by lincoln himself differ in their word ##ing , pun ##ct ##uation , and structure . [SEP]
[CLS] of these versions , the bliss version , written well after the speech as a favor for a friend , is viewed by many as the standard text . [SEP]
[CLS] its text differs , however , from the written versions prepared by lincoln before and after his speech . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the only version to which lincoln af ##fixed his signature , and the last he is known to have written . [SEP]
[CLS] in " lincoln at gettysburg " , garry wills notes the parallels between lincoln ' s speech and per ##icles ' s funeral or ##ation during the pe ##lo ##pon ##nesian war as described by th ##uc ##yd ##ides . [SEP]
[CLS] ( james mcpherson notes this connection in his review of wills ' s book . [SEP]
[CLS] gore vidal also draws attention to this link in a bbc documentary about or ##ation . ) [SEP]
[CLS] per ##icles ' speech , like lincoln ' s : in contrast , writer adam go ##p ##nik , in " the new yorker " , notes that while everett ' s or ##ation was explicitly neoclassical , referring directly to marathon and per ##icles , " lincoln ' s rhetoric is , instead , deliberately biblical . [SEP]
[CLS] ( it is difficult to find a single obviously classical reference in any of his speeches . ) [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln had mastered the sound of the king james bible so completely that he could rec ##ast abstract issues of constitutional law in biblical terms , making the proposition that texas and new hampshire should be forever bound by a single post office sound like something right out of genesis . " [SEP]
[CLS] several theories have been advanced by lincoln scholars to explain the proven ##ance of lincoln ' s famous phrase " government of the people , by the people , for the people " . [SEP]
[CLS] despite many claims , there is no evidence a similar phrase appears in the prologue to john w ##y ##cliffe ' s 138 ##4 english translation of the bible . [SEP]
[CLS] craig r . smith , in " criticism of political rhetoric and disciplinary integrity " , suggested lincoln ' s view of the government as expressed in the gettysburg address was influenced by the noted speech of massachusetts senator daniel webster , the " second reply to hay ##ne " , in which webster famously thunder ##ed " liberty and union , now and forever , one and ins ##ep ##arable ! " [SEP]
[CLS] specifically , in this speech on january 26 , 1830 , before the united states senate , webster described the federal government as : " made for the people , made by the people , and answer ##able to the people " , fore ##sha ##do ##wing lincoln ' s " government of the people , by the people , for the people " . [SEP]
[CLS] webster also noted , " this government , sir , is the independent offspring of the popular will . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not the creature of state legislatures ; nay , more , if the whole truth must be told , the people brought it into existence , established it , and have hit ##her ##to supported it , for the very purpose , amongst others , of imposing certain sal ##uta ##ry restraints on state sovereign ##ties . " [SEP]
[CLS] a source pre ##dating these others with which lincoln was certainly familiar was chief justice john marshall ' s opinion in " mcc ##ull ##och v . maryland " ( 1819 ) , a case uphold ##ing federal authority to create a national bank and to be free from the state ' s powers to tax . [SEP]
[CLS] in asserting the superiority of federal power over the states , chief justice marshall stated : " the government of the union , then ( whatever may be the influence of this fact on the case ) , is , em ##pha ##tically and truly , a government of the people . [SEP]
[CLS] in form , and in substance , it em ##ana ##tes from them . [SEP]
[CLS] its powers are granted by them , and are to be exercised directly on them , and for their benefit . " [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln , a lawyer and president engaged in the greatest struggle of federal ##ism , was ( more el ##o ##quent ##ly ) echoing the pre ##emi ##nent case that had solid ##ified federal power over the states . [SEP]
[CLS] wills observed lincoln ' s usage of the imagery of birth , life , and death in reference to a nation " brought forth " , " conceived " , and that shall not " per ##ish " . [SEP]
[CLS] others , including allen c . gu ##el ##zo , the director of civil war era studies at gettysburg college in pennsylvania , suggested that lincoln ' s formulation " four score and seven " was an all ##usion to the king james version of the bible ' s , in which man ' s lifespan is given as " three ##sco ##re years and ten ; and if by reason of strength they be fours ##core years " . [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln was probably influenced by la ##jos ko ##ss ##uth — the formerly governor of hungary — who gave a speech before the ohio state legislature on february 1852 : " the spirit of our age is democracy . [SEP]
[CLS] all for the people , and all by the people . [SEP]
[CLS] nothing about the people without the people — that is democracy ! [SEP]
[CLS] each of the five known manuscript copies of the gettysburg address is named for the person who received it from lincoln . [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln gave copies to his private secretaries , john nicola ##y and john hay . [SEP]
[CLS] both of these drafts were written around the time of his november 19 address , while the other three copies of the address , the everett , bancroft , and bliss copies , were written by lincoln for charitable purposes well after november 19 . [SEP]
[CLS] in part because lincoln provided a title and signed and dated the bliss copy , it has become the standard text of lincoln ' s gettysburg address . [SEP]
[CLS] nicola ##y and hay were appointed cu ##sto ##dian ##s of lincoln ' s papers by lincoln ' s son robert todd lincoln in 1874 . [SEP]
[CLS] after appearing in fa ##cs ##imi ##le in an article written by john nicola ##y in 1894 , the nicola ##y copy was presumably among the papers passed to hay by nicola ##y ' s daughter helen upon nicola ##y ' s death in 1901 . [SEP]
[CLS] robert lincoln began a search for the original copy in 1908 , which resulted in the discovery of a hand ##written copy of the gettysburg address among the bound papers of john hay — a copy now known as the " hay copy " or " hay draft " . [SEP]
[CLS] the hay draft differed from the version of the gettysburg address published by john nicola ##y in 1894 in a number of significant ways : it was written on a different type of paper , had a different number of words per line and number of lines , and contained editorial revisions in lincoln ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] both the hay and nicola ##y copies of the address are within the library of congress , en ##cased in specially designed , temperature - controlled , sealed containers with ar ##gon gas in order to protect the documents from oxidation and continued deterioration . [SEP]
[CLS] the nicola ##y copy is often called the " first draft " because it is believed to be the earliest copy that exists . [SEP]
[CLS] scholars disagree over whether the nicola ##y copy was actually the reading copy lincoln held at gettysburg on november 19 . [SEP]
[CLS] in an 1894 article that included a fa ##cs ##imi ##le of this copy , nicola ##y , who had become the cu ##sto ##dian of lincoln ' s papers , wrote that lincoln had brought to gettysburg the first part of the speech written in ink on executive mansion station ##ery , and that he had written the second page in pencil on lined paper before the dedication on november 19 . [SEP]
[CLS] matching folds are still evident on the two pages , suggesting it could be the copy that eye ##wi ##tness ##es say lincoln took from his coat pocket and read at the ceremony . [SEP]
[CLS] others believe that the delivery text has been lost , because some of the words and phrases of the nicola ##y copy do not match contemporary transcription ##s of lincoln ' s original speech . [SEP]
[CLS] the words " under god " , for example , are missing in this copy from the phrase " that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom . . . " in order for the nicola ##y draft to have been the reading copy , either the contemporary transcription ##s were inaccurate , or lincoln would have had to depart from his written text in several instances . [SEP]
[CLS] this copy of the gettysburg address apparently remained in john nicola ##y ' s possession until his death in 1901 , when it passed to his friend and colleague john hay . [SEP]
[CLS] it used to be on display as part of the american treasures exhibition of the library of congress in washington , d . c . [SEP]
[CLS] the existence of the hay copy was first announced to the public in 1906 , after the search for the " original manuscript " of the address among the papers of john hay brought it to light . [SEP]
[CLS] significantly , it differs somewhat from the manuscript of the address described by john nicola ##y in his article , and contains numerous om ##iss ##ions and insert ##s in lincoln ' s own hand , including om ##iss ##ions critical to the basic meaning of the sentence , not simply words that would be added by lincoln to strengthen or clarify their meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] in this copy , as in the nicola ##y copy , the words " under god " are not present . [SEP]
[CLS] this version has been described as " the most in ##ex ##pl ##ica ##ble " of the drafts and is sometimes referred to as the " second draft " . [SEP]
[CLS] the " hay copy " was made either on the morning of the delivery of the address , or shortly after lincoln ' s return to washington . [SEP]
[CLS] those who believe that it was completed on the morning of his address point to the fact that it contains certain phrases that are not in the first draft but are in the reports of the address as delivered and in subsequent copies made by lincoln . [SEP]
[CLS] it is probable , they conclude , that , as stated in the ex ##pl ##ana ##tory note accompanying the original copies of the first and second drafts in the library of congress , lincoln held this second draft when he delivered the address . [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln eventually gave this copy to hay , whose descendants donated both it and the nicola ##y copy to the library of congress in 1916 . [SEP]
[CLS] the everett copy , also known as the " everett - key ##es copy " , was sent by president lincoln to edward everett in early 1864 , at everett ' s request . [SEP]
[CLS] everett was collecting the speeches at the gettysburg dedication into one bound volume to sell for the benefit of stricken soldiers at new york ' s sanitary commission fair . [SEP]
[CLS] the draft lincoln sent became the third auto ##graph copy , and is now in the possession of the illinois state historical library in springfield , illinois , where it is displayed in the treasures gallery of the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum . [SEP]
[CLS] the bancroft copy of the gettysburg address was written out by president lincoln in february 1864 at the request of george bancroft , the famed historian and former secretary of the navy , whose comprehensive ten - volume " history of the united states " later led him to be known as the " father of american history " . [SEP]
[CLS] bancroft planned to include this copy in " auto ##graph leaves of our country ' s authors " , which he planned to sell at a soldiers ' and sailors ' sanitary fair in baltimore . [SEP]
[CLS] as this fourth copy was written on both sides of the paper , it proved un ##usa ##ble for this purpose , and bancroft was allowed to keep it . [SEP]
[CLS] this manuscript is the only one accompanied both by a letter from lincoln transmitting the manuscript and by the original envelope addressed and frank ##ed by lincoln . [SEP]
[CLS] this copy remained in the bancroft family for many years , was sold to various dealers and purchased by nicholas and marguerite lilly no ##yes , who donated the manuscript to cornell in 1949 . [SEP]
[CLS] it is now held by the division of rare and manuscript collections in the carl a . k ##ro ##ch library at cornell university . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the only one of the five copies to be privately owned . [SEP]
[CLS] discovering that his fourth written copy could not be used , lincoln then wrote a fifth draft , which was accepted for the purpose requested . [SEP]
[CLS] the bliss copy , named for colonel alexander bliss , bancroft ' s steps ##on and publisher of " auto ##graph leaves " , is the only draft to which lincoln af ##fixed his signature . [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln is not known to have made any further copies of the gettysburg address . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the apparent care in its preparation , and in part , because lincoln provided a title and signed and dated this copy , it has become the standard version of the address and the source for most fa ##cs ##imi ##le reproduction ##s of lincoln ' s gettysburg address . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the version that is inscribed on the south wall of the lincoln memorial . [SEP]
[CLS] this draft is now displayed in the lincoln room of the white house , a gift of oscar b . ci ##nta ##s , former cuban ambassador to the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] ci ##nta ##s , a wealthy collector of art and manuscripts , purchased the bliss copy at a public auction in 1949 for $ 54 , 000 ( $ as of 2019 ) , at that time the highest price ever paid for a document at public auction . [SEP]
[CLS] ci ##nta ##s ' properties were claimed by the castro government after the cuban revolution in 1959 , but ci ##nta ##s , who died in 1957 , willed the gettysburg address to the american people , provided it would be kept at the white house , where it was transferred in 1959 . [SEP]
[CLS] garry wills concluded the bliss copy " is stylistic ##ally prefer ##able to others in one significant way : lincoln removed ' here ' from ' that cause for which they ( here ) gave . . . ' the seventh ' here ' is in all other versions of the speech . " [SEP]
[CLS] wills noted the fact that lincoln " was still making such improvements " , suggesting lincoln was more concerned with a perfect ##ed text than with an ' original ' one . [SEP]
[CLS] from november 21 , 2008 , to january 1 , 2009 , the albert h . small documents gallery at the smithsonian institution national museum of american history hosted a limited public viewing of the bliss copy , with the support of then - first lady laura bush . [SEP]
[CLS] the museum also launched an online exhibition and interactive gallery to enable visitors to look more closely at the document . [SEP]
[CLS] another contemporary source of the text is the associated press dispatch , transcribed from the short ##hand notes taken by reporter joseph l . gilbert . [SEP]
[CLS] it also differs from the drafted text in a number of minor ways . [SEP]
[CLS] eye ##wi ##tness reports vary as to their view of lincoln ' s performance . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1931 , the printed rec ##oll ##ection ##s of 87 - year - old mrs . sarah a . cooke myers , who was 19 when she attended the ceremony , suggest a dig ##nified silence followed lincoln ' s speech : " i was close to the president and heard all of the address , but it seemed short . [SEP]
[CLS] then there was an impressive silence like our men ##alle ##n friends meeting . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no applause when he stopped speaking . " [SEP]
[CLS] according to historian shelby foot ##e , after lincoln ' s presentation , the applause was delayed , scattered , and " barely polite " . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , pennsylvania governor andrew gregg curt ##in maintained , " he pronounced that speech in a voice that all the multitude heard . [SEP]
[CLS] the crowd was hushed into silence because the president stood before them . . . it was so impressive ! [SEP]
[CLS] it was the common remark of everybody . [SEP]
[CLS] such a speech , as they said it was ! " [SEP]
[CLS] rein ##ter ##ment of soldiers ' remains from field graves into the cemetery , which had begun within months of the battle , was less than half complete on the day of the ceremony . [SEP]
[CLS] in an of ##t - repeated legend , lincoln is said to have turned to his bodyguard ward hill lam ##on and remarked that his speech , like a bad pl ##ow , " won ' t sc ##our " . [SEP]
[CLS] according to garry wills , this statement has no basis in fact and largely originates from the unreliable rec ##oll ##ection ##s of lam ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] in garry wills ' s view , " had done what he wanted to do " . [SEP]
[CLS] in a letter to lincoln written the following day , everett praised the president for his el ##o ##quent and con ##cise speech , saying , " i should be glad if i could flat ##ter myself that i came as near to the central idea of the occasion , in two hours , as you did in two minutes . " [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln replied that he was glad to know the speech was not a " total failure " . [SEP]
[CLS] other public reaction to the speech was divided along partisan lines . [SEP]
[CLS] the democratic - leaning " chicago times " observed , " the cheek of every american must tingle with shame as he reads the silly , flat and dish ##water ##y utter ##ances of the man who has to be pointed out to intelligent foreigners as the president of the united states . " [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , the republican - leaning " the new york times " was compliment ##ary and printed the speech . [SEP]
[CLS] in massachusetts , the " springfield republican " also printed the entire speech , calling it " a perfect gem " that was " deep in feeling , compact in thought and expression , and taste ##ful and elegant in every word and com ##ma " . [SEP]
[CLS] the " republican " predicted that lincoln ' s brief remarks would " repay further study as the model speech " . [SEP]
[CLS] on the se ##s ##qui ##cent ##ennial of the address , " the patriot - news " of harrisburg , pennsylvania , formerly the " patriot & union " , retracted its original reaction ( " silly remarks " des ##erving " the veil of oblivion " ) stating : " seven score and ten years ago , the fore ##fat ##hers of this media institution brought forth to its audience a judgment so flawed , so tainted by hub ##ris , so lacking in the perspective history would bring , that it cannot remain una ##dd ##ressed in our archives . [SEP]
[CLS] . . . the " patriot & union " failed to recognize the speech ' s moment ##ous importance , timeless el ##o ##que ##nce , and lasting significance . [SEP]
[CLS] the " patriot - news " regrets the error . " [SEP]
[CLS] foreign newspapers also criticized lincoln ' s remarks . [SEP]
[CLS] " the times " of london commented : " the ceremony at gettysburg was rendered lu ##dic ##rous by some of the luck ##less sal ##lies of that poor president lincoln . " [SEP]
[CLS] congressman joseph a . gould ##en , then an eighteen - year - old school teacher , was present and heard the speech . [SEP]
[CLS] he served in the united states marine corps during the war , and later had a successful career in insurance in pennsylvania and new york city before entering congress as a democrat . [SEP]
[CLS] in his later life , gould ##en was often asked about the speech , since the passage of time made him one of a d ##wind ##ling number of individuals who had been present for it . [SEP]
[CLS] he commented on the event and lincoln ' s speech in favorable terms , naming lincoln ' s address as one of the inspiration ##s for him to enter military service . [SEP]
[CLS] gould ##en ' s rec ##oll ##ection ##s included remarks to the house of representatives in 1914 . [SEP]
[CLS] william r . rat ##h ##von is the only known eye ##wi ##tness of both lincoln ' s arrival at gettysburg and the address itself to have left an audio recording of his rec ##oll ##ection ##s which can be found here . [SEP]
[CLS] one year before his death in 1939 , rat ##h ##von ' s re ##mini ##sc ##ence ##s were recorded on february 12 , 1938 , at the boston studios of radio station wr ##ul , including his reading the address , itself , and a 78 rpm record was pressed . [SEP]
[CLS] the title of the 78 record was " i heard lincoln that day – william r . rat ##h ##von , tr productions " . [SEP]
[CLS] a copy wound up at national public radio ( npr ) during a " quest for sound " project in 1999 . [SEP]
[CLS] this link depicts the story but it can no longer play it . [SEP]
[CLS] like most people who came to gettysburg , the rat ##h ##von family was aware that lincoln was going to make some remarks . [SEP]
[CLS] the family went to the town square where the procession was to form to go out to the cemetery that had not been completed yet . [SEP]
[CLS] at the head of the procession rode lincoln on a gray horse preceded by a military band that was the first the young boy had ever seen . [SEP]
[CLS] rat ##h ##von describes lincoln as so tall and with such long legs that they went almost to the ground ; he also mentions the long el ##o ##quent speech given by edward everett of massachusetts whom rat ##h ##von accurately described as the " most finished or ##ator of the day " . [SEP]
[CLS] rat ##h ##von then goes on to describe how lincoln stepped forward and " with a manner serious almost to sadness , gave his brief address " . [SEP]
[CLS] during the delivery , along with some other boys , young rat ##h ##von wiggled his way forward through the crowd until he stood within 15 feet of mr . lincoln and looked up into what he described as lincoln ' s " serious face " . [SEP]
[CLS] rat ##h ##von recalls candi ##dly that , although he listened " intently to every word the president uttered and heard it clearly " , he explains , " boy ##like , i could not recall any of it afterwards " . [SEP]
[CLS] but he explains that if anyone said anything di ##spar ##aging about " honest abe " , there would have been a " junior battle of gettysburg " . [SEP]
[CLS] in the recording rat ##h ##von speaks of lincoln ' s speech all ##egorical ##ly " echoing through the hills " . [SEP]
[CLS] the only known and confirmed photograph of lincoln at gettysburg , taken by photographer david bach ##rac ##h was identified in the mathew brady collection of photographic plates in the national archives and records administration in 1952 . [SEP]
[CLS] while lincoln ' s speech was short and may have pre ##cl ##uded multiple pictures of him while speaking , he and the other dignitaries sat for hours during the rest of the program . [SEP]
[CLS] given the length of everett ' s speech and the length of time it took for 19th - century photographers to get " set up " before taking a picture , it is quite plausible that the photographers were ill - prepared for the br ##ev ##ity of lincoln ' s remarks . [SEP]
[CLS] the words " under god " do not appear in the nicola ##y and hay drafts but are included in the three later copies ( everett , bancroft , and bliss ) . [SEP]
[CLS] accordingly , some sk ##ept ##ics maintain that lincoln did not utter the words " under god " at gettysburg . [SEP]
[CLS] however , at least three reporters telegraph ##ed the text of lincoln ' s speech on the day the address was given with the words " under god " included . [SEP]
[CLS] the reporters present included joseph gilbert , from the associated press ; charles hale , from the " boston ad ##vert ##iser " ; john r . young ( who later became the librarian of congress ) , from the " philadelphia press " ; and reporters from the " cincinnati commercial " , " new york tribune " , and " the new york times " . [SEP]
[CLS] charles hale " had notebook and pencil in hand , and took down the slow - spoken words of the president " . [SEP]
[CLS] " he took down what he declared was the exact language of lincoln ' s address , and his declaration was as good as the oath of a court ste ##no ##grapher . [SEP]
[CLS] his associates confirmed his testimony , which was received , as it deserved to be , at its face value . " [SEP]
[CLS] one explanation is that lincoln devi ##ated from his prepared text and inserted the phrase when he spoke . [SEP]
[CLS] it was an un ##cha ##rac ##ter ##istic ##ally spontaneous revision for a speaker who did not trust ex ##tem ##por ##aneous speech . [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln had added impromptu words in several earlier speeches , but always offered a subsequent apology for the change . [SEP]
[CLS] in this instance , he did not . [SEP]
[CLS] and lincoln included " under god " in all three copies of the address he prepared at later dates . [SEP]
[CLS] " under god " pointed backward and forward : back to " this nation " , which drew its breath from both political and religious sources , but also forward to a " new birth " . [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln had come to see the civil war as a ritual of purification . [SEP]
[CLS] the old union had to die . [SEP]
[CLS] the old man had to die . [SEP]
[CLS] death became a transition to a new union and a new humanity . [SEP]
[CLS] the phrase " under god " was used frequently in works published before 1860 , usually with the meaning " with god ' s help " . [SEP]
[CLS] nearby , nov . 19 , 1863 , in de ##dic ##ating the national cemetery , abraham lincoln gave the address which he had written in washington and revised after his arrival at gettysburg the evening of november 18 . [SEP]
[CLS] directly inside the tan ##ey ##town road entrance are located the ro ##st ##rum and the " lincoln address memorial . " [SEP]
[CLS] neither of these is located within 300 yards of any of the five ( or more ) claimed locations for the de ##dic ##atory platform . [SEP]
[CLS] colonel w . yates sell ##eck was a marshal in the parade on consecration day and was seated on the platform when lincoln made the address . [SEP]
[CLS] sell ##eck marked a map with the position of the platform and described it as " 350 feet almost due north of soldiers ' national monument , 40 feet from a point in the outer circle of lots where the michigan and new york burial sections are separated by a path " . [SEP]
[CLS] a location which approximate ##s this description is 39 ##° ##49 . 243 ′ n , 77 ##° ##13 . 86 ##9 ′ w . [SEP]
[CLS] as pointed out in 1973 by retired park historian frederick til ##berg , the " sell ##eck site " is 25 feet lower than the crest of cemetery hill , and only the crest presents a pan ##ora ##mic view of the battlefield . [SEP]
[CLS] a spectacular view from the location of the speech was noted by many eye ##wi ##tness ##es , is consistent with the " traditional site " at the soldiers ' national monument ( and other sites on the crest ) but is inconsistent with the " sell ##eck site . " [SEP]
[CLS] the " kentucky memorial " , erected in 1975 , is directly adjacent to the soldiers ' national monument , and states , " kentucky honors her son , abraham lincoln , who delivered his immortal address at the site now marked by the soldiers ' monument . " [SEP]
[CLS] with its position at the center of the con ##centric rings of soldiers ' graves and the continuing endorsement of lincoln ' s native state the soldiers ' national monument persist ##s as a credible location for the speech . [SEP]
[CLS] writing a physical description of the layout for the gettysburg national cemetery under construction in november 1863 , the correspondent from the " cincinnati daily commercial " described the dividing lines between the state grave plots as " the ra ##di ##i of a common center , where a flag pole is now raised , but where it is proposed to erect a national monument " . [SEP]
[CLS] with the inclusion of this quota ##tion til ##berg inadvertently ve ##ri ##fies a central principle of future photographic analyses — a flag ##pole , rather than the speakers ' platform , occupied the central point of the soldiers ' graves . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , the precision of the photo - analyses relies upon the coincidence of position between this temporary flag pole and the future monument . [SEP]
[CLS] confusing to today ' s tourist , the " kentucky memorial " is contra ##dict ##ed by a newer marker which was erected nearby by the gettysburg national military park and locate ##s the speakers ' platform inside evergreen cemetery . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , outdated national park service documents which pin ##point the location at the soldiers ' national monument have not been systematically revised since the placement of the newer marker . [SEP]
[CLS] miscellaneous web pages per ##pet ##uate the " traditional site . " [SEP]
[CLS] based upon photographic analysis , the gettysburg national military park ( g . n . m . p . ) placed a marker ( near ) which states , " the speakers ' platform was located in evergreen cemetery to your left . " [SEP]
[CLS] the observer of this marker stands facing the fence which separates the two cemeteries ( one public and one private ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1982 , senior park historian kathleen georg harrison first analyzed photographs and proposed a location in evergreen cemetery but has not published her analysis . [SEP]
[CLS] speaking for harrison without revealing details , two sources character ##ize her proposed location as " on or near the brown family vault " in evergreen cemetery . [SEP]
[CLS] william a . fra ##ssa ##ni ##to , a former military intelligence analyst , documented a comprehensive photographic analysis in 1995 , and it associates the location of the platform with the position of specific modern heads ##tones in evergreen cemetery . [SEP]
[CLS] according to fra ##ssa ##ni ##to , the extant graves of israel you ##nt ( died 1892 ) , john koch ( died 1913 ) , and george e . kit ##z ##mill ##er ( died 1874 ) are among those which occupy the location of the 1863 speaker ' s stand . [SEP]

[CLS] the location of the speech was actually on the crown of this hill , a short distance on the other side of the iron fence and inside the evergreen cemetery , where president lincoln delivered the gettysburg address to a crowd of some 15 , 000 people . [SEP]
[CLS] while the g ##n ##mp marker is un ##sp ##ec ##ific , providing only " to your left " , the locations determined by the harrison / wills analysis and the fra ##ssa ##ni ##to analysis differ by 40 yards . [SEP]
[CLS] fra ##ssa ##ni ##to has documented 1 ) his own conclusion , 2 ) his own methods and 3 ) a ref ##utation of the harrison site , but neither the g ##n ##mp nor harrison has provided any documentation . [SEP]
[CLS] each of the three points to a location in evergreen cemetery , as do modern np ##s publications . [SEP]
[CLS] although lincoln dedicated the gettysburg national cemetery , the monument at the cemetery ' s center actually has nothing to do with lincoln or his famous speech . [SEP]
[CLS] intended to symbol ##ize columbia paying tribute to her fallen sons , its appreciation has been command ##eer ##ed by the thirst for a tidy home for the speech . [SEP]

[CLS] the work challenges leaders to craft 272 word responses to celebrate lincoln , the gettysburg address , or a related topic . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the replies was by astro ##phy ##sic ##ist neil de ##grass ##e tyson in which he made the point that one of lincoln ' s greatest leg ##acies was establishing , in the same year of the gettysburg address , the national academy of sciences , which had the long ##ter ##m effect of " setting our nation on a course of scientific ##ally en ##light ##ened governance , without which we all may per ##ish from this earth " . [SEP]
[CLS] a common american myth about the gettysburg address is that lincoln quickly wrote the speech on the back of an envelope . [SEP]
