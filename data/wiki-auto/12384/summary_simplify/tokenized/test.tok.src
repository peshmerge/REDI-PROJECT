[CLS] the gettysburg address is a speech that u . s . president abraham lincoln delivered during the american civil war at the dedication of the soldiers ' national cemetery in gettysburg , pennsylvania , on the afternoon of thursday , november 19 , 1863 , four and a half months after the union armies defeated those of the confederacy at the battle of gettysburg . [SEP]
[CLS] not even the day ' s primary speech , lincoln ' s carefully crafted address came to be seen as one of the greatest and most influential statements of american national purpose . [SEP]
[CLS] in just 271 words , beginning with the now iconic phrase " four score and seven years ago , " referring to the signing of the declaration of independence 87 years earlier , lincoln described the us as a nation " conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal , " and represented the civil war as a test that would determine whether such a nation , the union sun ##der ##ed by the secession crisis , could endure . [SEP]
[CLS] he ex ##to ##lled the sacrifices of those who died at gettysburg in defense of those principles , and ex ##hort ##ed his listeners to resolve [SEP]
[CLS] despite the prominent place of the speech in the history and popular culture of the united states , its exact word ##ing is disputed . [SEP]
[CLS] the five known manuscripts of the gettysburg address in lincoln ' s hand differ in a number of details , and also differ from contemporary newspaper reprint ##s of the speech . [SEP]
[CLS] modern scholarship locate ##s the speakers ' platform 40 yards ( or more ) away from the traditional site in soldiers ' national cemetery at the soldiers ' national monument , such that it stood entirely within the private , adjacent evergreen cemetery . [SEP]
[CLS] in inviting president lincoln to the ceremonies , david wills , of the committee for the november 19 consecration of the national cemetery at gettysburg , wrote , " it is the desire that , after the or ##ation , you , as chief executive of the nation , formally set apart these grounds to their sacred use by a few appropriate remarks . " [SEP]
[CLS] on the train trip from washington , d . c . , to gettysburg on november 18 , lincoln was accompanied by three members of his cabinet , william se ##ward , john usher and montgomery blair , several foreign officials , his secretary john nicola ##y , and his assistant secretary , john hay . [SEP]
[CLS] during the trip lincoln remarked to hay that he felt weak ; on the morning of november 19 , lincoln mentioned to nicola ##y that he was dizzy . [SEP]
[CLS] while it is lincoln ' s short speech that has gone down in history as one of the finest examples of english public or ##atory , it was everett ' s two - hour or ##ation that was slated to be the " gettysburg address " that day . [SEP]
[CLS] standing beneath this serene sky , overlooking these broad fields now rep ##osing from the labor ##s of the wan ##ing year , the mighty all ##eg ##hen ##ies dimly towering before us , the graves of our brethren beneath our feet , it is with hesitation that i raise my poor voice to break the el ##o ##quent silence of god and nature . [SEP]
[CLS] but they , i am sure , will join us in saying , as we bid farewell to the dust of these martyr - heroes , that where ##so ##ever throughout the civilized world the accounts of this great warfare are read , and down to the latest period of recorded time , in the glorious annals of our common country , there will be no brighter page than that which relates the battles of gettysburg . [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln ' s address followed the or ##ation by edward everett , who subsequently included a copy of the gettysburg address in his 1864 book about the event ( " address of the hon . [SEP]
[CLS] edward everett at the consecration of the national cemetery at gettysburg , 19th november 1863 , with the de ##dic ##atory speech of president lincoln , and the other exercises of the occasion ; accompanied by an account of the origin of the undertaking and of the arrangement of the cemetery grounds , and by a map of the battle - field and a plan of the cemetery " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the historical significance of lincoln ' s speech , modern scholars disagree as to its exact word ##ing , and contemporary transcription ##s published in newspaper accounts of the event and even hand ##written copies by lincoln himself differ in their word ##ing , pun ##ct ##uation , and structure . [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln had mastered the sound of the king james bible so completely that he could rec ##ast abstract issues of constitutional law in biblical terms , making the proposition that texas and new hampshire should be forever bound by a single post office sound like something right out of genesis . " [SEP]
[CLS] despite many claims , there is no evidence a similar phrase appears in the prologue to john w ##y ##cliffe ' s 138 ##4 english translation of the bible . [SEP]
[CLS] craig r . smith , in " criticism of political rhetoric and disciplinary integrity " , suggested lincoln ' s view of the government as expressed in the gettysburg address was influenced by the noted speech of massachusetts senator daniel webster , the " second reply to hay ##ne " , in which webster famously thunder ##ed " liberty and union , now and forever , one and ins ##ep ##arable ! " [SEP]
[CLS] it is not the creature of state legislatures ; nay , more , if the whole truth must be told , the people brought it into existence , established it , and have hit ##her ##to supported it , for the very purpose , amongst others , of imposing certain sal ##uta ##ry restraints on state sovereign ##ties . " [SEP]
[CLS] a source pre ##dating these others with which lincoln was certainly familiar was chief justice john marshall ' s opinion in " mcc ##ull ##och v . maryland " ( 1819 ) , a case uphold ##ing federal authority to create a national bank and to be free from the state ' s powers to tax . [SEP]
[CLS] in asserting the superiority of federal power over the states , chief justice marshall stated : " the government of the union , then ( whatever may be the influence of this fact on the case ) , is , em ##pha ##tically and truly , a government of the people . [SEP]
[CLS] wills observed lincoln ' s usage of the imagery of birth , life , and death in reference to a nation " brought forth " , " conceived " , and that shall not " per ##ish " . [SEP]
[CLS] others , including allen c . gu ##el ##zo , the director of civil war era studies at gettysburg college in pennsylvania , suggested that lincoln ' s formulation " four score and seven " was an all ##usion to the king james version of the bible ' s , in which man ' s lifespan is given as " three ##sco ##re years and ten ; and if by reason of strength they be fours ##core years " . [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln was probably influenced by la ##jos ko ##ss ##uth — the formerly governor of hungary — who gave a speech before the ohio state legislature on february 1852 : " the spirit of our age is democracy . [SEP]
[CLS] each of the five known manuscript copies of the gettysburg address is named for the person who received it from lincoln . [SEP]
[CLS] in part because lincoln provided a title and signed and dated the bliss copy , it has become the standard text of lincoln ' s gettysburg address . [SEP]
[CLS] robert lincoln began a search for the original copy in 1908 , which resulted in the discovery of a hand ##written copy of the gettysburg address among the bound papers of john hay — a copy now known as the " hay copy " or " hay draft " . [SEP]
[CLS] the hay draft differed from the version of the gettysburg address published by john nicola ##y in 1894 in a number of significant ways : it was written on a different type of paper , had a different number of words per line and number of lines , and contained editorial revisions in lincoln ' s hand . [SEP]
[CLS] both the hay and nicola ##y copies of the address are within the library of congress , en ##cased in specially designed , temperature - controlled , sealed containers with ar ##gon gas in order to protect the documents from oxidation and continued deterioration . [SEP]
[CLS] scholars disagree over whether the nicola ##y copy was actually the reading copy lincoln held at gettysburg on november 19 . [SEP]
[CLS] in an 1894 article that included a fa ##cs ##imi ##le of this copy , nicola ##y , who had become the cu ##sto ##dian of lincoln ' s papers , wrote that lincoln had brought to gettysburg the first part of the speech written in ink on executive mansion station ##ery , and that he had written the second page in pencil on lined paper before the dedication on november 19 . [SEP]
[CLS] matching folds are still evident on the two pages , suggesting it could be the copy that eye ##wi ##tness ##es say lincoln took from his coat pocket and read at the ceremony . [SEP]
[CLS] others believe that the delivery text has been lost , because some of the words and phrases of the nicola ##y copy do not match contemporary transcription ##s of lincoln ' s original speech . [SEP]
[CLS] the words " under god " , for example , are missing in this copy from the phrase " that this nation shall have a new birth of freedom . . . " in order for the nicola ##y draft to have been the reading copy , either the contemporary transcription ##s were inaccurate , or lincoln would have had to depart from his written text in several instances . [SEP]
[CLS] this copy of the gettysburg address apparently remained in john nicola ##y ' s possession until his death in 1901 , when it passed to his friend and colleague john hay . [SEP]
[CLS] it used to be on display as part of the american treasures exhibition of the library of congress in washington , d . c . [SEP]
[CLS] the existence of the hay copy was first announced to the public in 1906 , after the search for the " original manuscript " of the address among the papers of john hay brought it to light . [SEP]
[CLS] the " hay copy " was made either on the morning of the delivery of the address , or shortly after lincoln ' s return to washington . [SEP]
[CLS] those who believe that it was completed on the morning of his address point to the fact that it contains certain phrases that are not in the first draft but are in the reports of the address as delivered and in subsequent copies made by lincoln . [SEP]
[CLS] it is probable , they conclude , that , as stated in the ex ##pl ##ana ##tory note accompanying the original copies of the first and second drafts in the library of congress , lincoln held this second draft when he delivered the address . [SEP]
[CLS] everett was collecting the speeches at the gettysburg dedication into one bound volume to sell for the benefit of stricken soldiers at new york ' s sanitary commission fair . [SEP]
[CLS] the draft lincoln sent became the third auto ##graph copy , and is now in the possession of the illinois state historical library in springfield , illinois , where it is displayed in the treasures gallery of the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum . [SEP]
[CLS] the bancroft copy of the gettysburg address was written out by president lincoln in february 1864 at the request of george bancroft , the famed historian and former secretary of the navy , whose comprehensive ten - volume " history of the united states " later led him to be known as the " father of american history " . [SEP]
[CLS] this copy remained in the bancroft family for many years , was sold to various dealers and purchased by nicholas and marguerite lilly no ##yes , who donated the manuscript to cornell in 1949 . [SEP]
[CLS] discovering that his fourth written copy could not be used , lincoln then wrote a fifth draft , which was accepted for the purpose requested . [SEP]
[CLS] the bliss copy , named for colonel alexander bliss , bancroft ' s steps ##on and publisher of " auto ##graph leaves " , is the only draft to which lincoln af ##fixed his signature . [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln is not known to have made any further copies of the gettysburg address . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the apparent care in its preparation , and in part , because lincoln provided a title and signed and dated this copy , it has become the standard version of the address and the source for most fa ##cs ##imi ##le reproduction ##s of lincoln ' s gettysburg address . [SEP]
[CLS] ci ##nta ##s ' properties were claimed by the castro government after the cuban revolution in 1959 , but ci ##nta ##s , who died in 1957 , willed the gettysburg address to the american people , provided it would be kept at the white house , where it was transferred in 1959 . [SEP]
[CLS] garry wills concluded the bliss copy " is stylistic ##ally prefer ##able to others in one significant way : lincoln removed ' here ' from ' that cause for which they ( here ) gave . . . ' the seventh ' here ' is in all other versions of the speech . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1931 , the printed rec ##oll ##ection ##s of 87 - year - old mrs . sarah a . cooke myers , who was 19 when she attended the ceremony , suggest a dig ##nified silence followed lincoln ' s speech : " i was close to the president and heard all of the address , but it seemed short . [SEP]
[CLS] rein ##ter ##ment of soldiers ' remains from field graves into the cemetery , which had begun within months of the battle , was less than half complete on the day of the ceremony . [SEP]
[CLS] in an of ##t - repeated legend , lincoln is said to have turned to his bodyguard ward hill lam ##on and remarked that his speech , like a bad pl ##ow , " won ' t sc ##our " . [SEP]
[CLS] in a letter to lincoln written the following day , everett praised the president for his el ##o ##quent and con ##cise speech , saying , " i should be glad if i could flat ##ter myself that i came as near to the central idea of the occasion , in two hours , as you did in two minutes . " [SEP]
[CLS] other public reaction to the speech was divided along partisan lines . [SEP]
[CLS] the democratic - leaning " chicago times " observed , " the cheek of every american must tingle with shame as he reads the silly , flat and dish ##water ##y utter ##ances of the man who has to be pointed out to intelligent foreigners as the president of the united states . " [SEP]
[CLS] in massachusetts , the " springfield republican " also printed the entire speech , calling it " a perfect gem " that was " deep in feeling , compact in thought and expression , and taste ##ful and elegant in every word and com ##ma " . [SEP]
[CLS] on the se ##s ##qui ##cent ##ennial of the address , " the patriot - news " of harrisburg , pennsylvania , formerly the " patriot & union " , retracted its original reaction ( " silly remarks " des ##erving " the veil of oblivion " ) stating : " seven score and ten years ago , the fore ##fat ##hers of this media institution brought forth to its audience a judgment so flawed , so tainted by hub ##ris , so lacking in the perspective history would bring , that it cannot remain una ##dd ##ressed in our archives . [SEP]
[CLS] " the times " of london commented : " the ceremony at gettysburg was rendered lu ##dic ##rous by some of the luck ##less sal ##lies of that poor president lincoln . " [SEP]
[CLS] he served in the united states marine corps during the war , and later had a successful career in insurance in pennsylvania and new york city before entering congress as a democrat . [SEP]
[CLS] in his later life , gould ##en was often asked about the speech , since the passage of time made him one of a d ##wind ##ling number of individuals who had been present for it . [SEP]
[CLS] he commented on the event and lincoln ' s speech in favorable terms , naming lincoln ' s address as one of the inspiration ##s for him to enter military service . [SEP]
[CLS] william r . rat ##h ##von is the only known eye ##wi ##tness of both lincoln ' s arrival at gettysburg and the address itself to have left an audio recording of his rec ##oll ##ection ##s which can be found here . [SEP]
[CLS] one year before his death in 1939 , rat ##h ##von ' s re ##mini ##sc ##ence ##s were recorded on february 12 , 1938 , at the boston studios of radio station wr ##ul , including his reading the address , itself , and a 78 rpm record was pressed . [SEP]
[CLS] the family went to the town square where the procession was to form to go out to the cemetery that had not been completed yet . [SEP]
[CLS] at the head of the procession rode lincoln on a gray horse preceded by a military band that was the first the young boy had ever seen . [SEP]
[CLS] rat ##h ##von describes lincoln as so tall and with such long legs that they went almost to the ground ; he also mentions the long el ##o ##quent speech given by edward everett of massachusetts whom rat ##h ##von accurately described as the " most finished or ##ator of the day " . [SEP]
[CLS] rat ##h ##von then goes on to describe how lincoln stepped forward and " with a manner serious almost to sadness , gave his brief address " . [SEP]
[CLS] during the delivery , along with some other boys , young rat ##h ##von wiggled his way forward through the crowd until he stood within 15 feet of mr . lincoln and looked up into what he described as lincoln ' s " serious face " . [SEP]
[CLS] rat ##h ##von recalls candi ##dly that , although he listened " intently to every word the president uttered and heard it clearly " , he explains , " boy ##like , i could not recall any of it afterwards " . [SEP]
[CLS] while lincoln ' s speech was short and may have pre ##cl ##uded multiple pictures of him while speaking , he and the other dignitaries sat for hours during the rest of the program . [SEP]
[CLS] given the length of everett ' s speech and the length of time it took for 19th - century photographers to get " set up " before taking a picture , it is quite plausible that the photographers were ill - prepared for the br ##ev ##ity of lincoln ' s remarks . [SEP]
[CLS] the words " under god " do not appear in the nicola ##y and hay drafts but are included in the three later copies ( everett , bancroft , and bliss ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , at least three reporters telegraph ##ed the text of lincoln ' s speech on the day the address was given with the words " under god " included . [SEP]
[CLS] the reporters present included joseph gilbert , from the associated press ; charles hale , from the " boston ad ##vert ##iser " ; john r . young ( who later became the librarian of congress ) , from the " philadelphia press " ; and reporters from the " cincinnati commercial " , " new york tribune " , and " the new york times " . [SEP]
[CLS] " he took down what he declared was the exact language of lincoln ' s address , and his declaration was as good as the oath of a court ste ##no ##grapher . [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln had added impromptu words in several earlier speeches , but always offered a subsequent apology for the change . [SEP]
[CLS] and lincoln included " under god " in all three copies of the address he prepared at later dates . [SEP]
[CLS] colonel w . yates sell ##eck was a marshal in the parade on consecration day and was seated on the platform when lincoln made the address . [SEP]
[CLS] sell ##eck marked a map with the position of the platform and described it as " 350 feet almost due north of soldiers ' national monument , 40 feet from a point in the outer circle of lots where the michigan and new york burial sections are separated by a path " . [SEP]
[CLS] as pointed out in 1973 by retired park historian frederick til ##berg , the " sell ##eck site " is 25 feet lower than the crest of cemetery hill , and only the crest presents a pan ##ora ##mic view of the battlefield . [SEP]
[CLS] a spectacular view from the location of the speech was noted by many eye ##wi ##tness ##es , is consistent with the " traditional site " at the soldiers ' national monument ( and other sites on the crest ) but is inconsistent with the " sell ##eck site . " [SEP]
[CLS] the " kentucky memorial " , erected in 1975 , is directly adjacent to the soldiers ' national monument , and states , " kentucky honors her son , abraham lincoln , who delivered his immortal address at the site now marked by the soldiers ' monument . " [SEP]
[CLS] with its position at the center of the con ##centric rings of soldiers ' graves and the continuing endorsement of lincoln ' s native state the soldiers ' national monument persist ##s as a credible location for the speech . [SEP]
[CLS] writing a physical description of the layout for the gettysburg national cemetery under construction in november 1863 , the correspondent from the " cincinnati daily commercial " described the dividing lines between the state grave plots as " the ra ##di ##i of a common center , where a flag pole is now raised , but where it is proposed to erect a national monument " . [SEP]
[CLS] with the inclusion of this quota ##tion til ##berg inadvertently ve ##ri ##fies a central principle of future photographic analyses — a flag ##pole , rather than the speakers ' platform , occupied the central point of the soldiers ' graves . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , the precision of the photo - analyses relies upon the coincidence of position between this temporary flag pole and the future monument . [SEP]
[CLS] confusing to today ' s tourist , the " kentucky memorial " is contra ##dict ##ed by a newer marker which was erected nearby by the gettysburg national military park and locate ##s the speakers ' platform inside evergreen cemetery . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , outdated national park service documents which pin ##point the location at the soldiers ' national monument have not been systematically revised since the placement of the newer marker . [SEP]
[CLS] william a . fra ##ssa ##ni ##to , a former military intelligence analyst , documented a comprehensive photographic analysis in 1995 , and it associates the location of the platform with the position of specific modern heads ##tones in evergreen cemetery . [SEP]
[CLS] the g ##n ##mp marker , wills ' interpretation of harrison ' s analysis , and the fra ##ssa ##ni ##to analysis con ##cu ##r that the platform was located in private evergreen cemetery , rather than public soldiers ' national cemetery . [SEP]
[CLS] the national park service ' s " national cemetery walking tour " bro ##chu ##re is one np ##s document which agrees : the soldiers ' national monument , long mis ##ide ##nti ##fied as the spot from which lincoln spoke , honors the fallen soldiers . [SEP]
[CLS] the location of the speech was actually on the crown of this hill , a short distance on the other side of the iron fence and inside the evergreen cemetery , where president lincoln delivered the gettysburg address to a crowd of some 15 , 000 people . [SEP]
[CLS] while the g ##n ##mp marker is un ##sp ##ec ##ific , providing only " to your left " , the locations determined by the harrison / wills analysis and the fra ##ssa ##ni ##to analysis differ by 40 yards . [SEP]
[CLS] each of the three points to a location in evergreen cemetery , as do modern np ##s publications . [SEP]
[CLS] intended to symbol ##ize columbia paying tribute to her fallen sons , its appreciation has been command ##eer ##ed by the thirst for a tidy home for the speech . [SEP]
[CLS] freeing the cemetery and monument to serve their original purpose , honoring of union departed , is as unlikely as a resolution to the location controversy and the erection of a public monument to the speech in the exclusively private evergreen cemetery . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to its prominent place carved into a stone cell ##a on the south wall of the lincoln memorial in washington , d . c . , the gettysburg address is frequently referred to in works of popular culture , with the implicit expectation that contemporary audiences will be familiar with lincoln ' s words . [SEP]
[CLS] in the many generations that have passed since the address , it has remained among the most famous speeches in american history , and is often taught in classes about history or civic ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln ' s gettysburg address is itself referenced in another of those famed or ##ations , martin luther king jr . ' s " i have a dream " speech . [SEP]
[CLS] standing on the steps of the lincoln memorial in august 1963 , king began with a reference , by the style of his opening phrase , to president lincoln and his enduring words : " five score years ago , a great american , in whose symbolic shadow we stand today , signed the emancipation proclamation . [SEP]
[CLS] this moment ##ous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of negro slaves who had been sea ##red in the flames of with ##ering injustice . " [SEP]
[CLS] sun ya ##t - sen ' s " three principles of the people " as well as the pre ##am ##ble for the 1947 constitution of japan were also inspired from that phrase . [SEP]
[CLS] senator charles sumner of massachusetts wrote of the address and its enduring presence in american culture after lincoln ' s assassination in april 1865 : " that speech , uttered at the field of gettysburg . . . and now san ##ct ##ified by the martyr ##dom of its author , is a monumental act . [SEP]
[CLS] in the modest ##y of his nature he said ' the world will little note , nor long remember what we say here ; but it can never forget what they did here . ' [SEP]
[CLS] the world at once noted what he said , and will never cease to remember it . " [SEP]
[CLS] u . s . president john f . kennedy stated in july 1963 about the battle and lincoln ' s speech : " five score years ago the ground on which we here stand shuddered under the clash of arms and was consecrated for all time by the blood of american man ##hood . [SEP]
[CLS] abraham lincoln , in de ##dic ##ating this great battlefield , has expressed , in words too el ##o ##quent for para ##ph ##rase or summary , why this sacrifice was necessary . " [SEP]
[CLS] one of the replies was by astro ##phy ##sic ##ist neil de ##grass ##e tyson in which he made the point that one of lincoln ' s greatest leg ##acies was establishing , in the same year of the gettysburg address , the national academy of sciences , which had the long ##ter ##m effect of " setting our nation on a course of scientific ##ally en ##light ##ened governance , without which we all may per ##ish from this earth " . [SEP]
[CLS] a common american myth about the gettysburg address is that lincoln quickly wrote the speech on the back of an envelope . [SEP]
[CLS] this widely held misunderstanding may have originated with a popular book , " the perfect tribute " , by mary raymond ship ##man andrews ( 1906 ) , which was assigned reading for generations of school ##child ##ren , sold 600 , 000 copies when published as a standalone volume , and was twice adapted for film . [SEP]
[CLS] other lesser - known claims include harriet beech ##er st ##owe ' s assertion that lincoln had composed the address " in only a few moments , " and that of industrialist andrew carnegie , who claimed to have personally supplied lincoln with a pen . [SEP]
