[CLS] the ##rm ##oche ##mist ##ry is the study of the heat energy associated with chemical reactions and / or physical transformations . [SEP]
[CLS] the ##rm ##oche ##mist ##ry focuses on these energy changes , particularly on the system ' s energy exchange with its surroundings . [SEP]
[CLS] the ##rm ##oche ##mist ##ry is useful in predicting react ##ant and product quantities throughout the course of a given reaction . [SEP]
[CLS] these statements preceded the first law of the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mics ( 1845 ) and helped in its formulation . [SEP]
[CLS] integration of this equation permits the evaluation of the heat of reaction at one temperature from measurements at another temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] the measurement of heat changes is performed using cal ##ori ##metry , usually an enclosed chamber within which the change to be examined occurs . [SEP]
[CLS] the temperature of the chamber is monitored either using a the ##rm ##ometer or the ##rm ##oco ##up ##le , and the temperature plotted against time to give a graph from which fundamental quantities can be calculated . [SEP]
[CLS] modern cal ##ori ##meter ##s are frequently supplied with automatic devices to provide a quick read - out of information , one example being the differential scanning cal ##ori ##meter ( ds ##c ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a system is the specific portion of the universe that is being studied . [SEP]
[CLS] a system undergoes a process when one or more of its properties changes . [SEP]
[CLS] a process relates to the change of state . [SEP]
[CLS] an iso ##thermal ( same - temperature ) process occurs when temperature of the system remains constant . [SEP]
[CLS] an iso ##bari ##c ( same - pressure ) process occurs when the pressure of the system remains constant . [SEP]
