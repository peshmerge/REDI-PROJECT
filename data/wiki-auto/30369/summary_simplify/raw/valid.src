Thermochemistry is the study of the heat energy associated with chemical reactions and/or physical transformations.
Thermochemistry focuses on these energy changes, particularly on the system's energy exchange with its surroundings.
Thermochemistry is useful in predicting reactant and product quantities throughout the course of a given reaction.
These statements preceded the first law of thermodynamics (1845) and helped in its formulation.
Integration of this equation permits the evaluation of the heat of reaction at one temperature from measurements at another temperature.
The measurement of heat changes is performed using calorimetry, usually an enclosed chamber within which the change to be examined occurs.
The temperature of the chamber is monitored either using a thermometer or thermocouple, and the temperature plotted against time to give a graph from which fundamental quantities can be calculated.
Modern calorimeters are frequently supplied with automatic devices to provide a quick read-out of information, one example being the differential scanning calorimeter (DSC).
A system is the specific portion of the universe that is being studied.
A system undergoes a process when one or more of its properties changes.
A process relates to the change of state.
An isothermal (same-temperature) process occurs when temperature of the system remains constant.
An isobaric (same-pressure) process occurs when the pressure of the system remains constant.
