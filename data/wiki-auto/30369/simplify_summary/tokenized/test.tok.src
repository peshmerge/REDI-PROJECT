[CLS] the ##rm ##oche ##mist ##ry is the study of the heat energy associated with chemical reactions and / or physical transformations . [SEP]
[CLS] a reaction may release or absorb energy , and a phase change may do the same , such as in melting and boiling . [SEP]
[CLS] the ##rm ##oche ##mist ##ry focuses on these energy changes , particularly on the system ' s energy exchange with its surroundings . [SEP]
[CLS] the ##rm ##oche ##mist ##ry is useful in predicting react ##ant and product quantities throughout the course of a given reaction . [SEP]
[CLS] in combination with entropy determination ##s , it is also used to predict whether a reaction is spontaneous or non - spontaneous , favorable or un ##fa ##vor ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] end ##oth ##er ##mic reactions absorb heat , while ex ##oth ##er ##mic reactions release heat . [SEP]
[CLS] the ##rm ##oche ##mist ##ry coal ##es ##ces the concepts of the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mics with the concept of energy in the form of chemical bonds . [SEP]
[CLS] the subject commonly includes calculations of such quantities as heat capacity , heat of combustion , heat of formation , en ##thal ##py , entropy , free energy , and cal ##ories . [SEP]
[CLS] the ##rm ##oche ##mist ##ry rests on two general ##izations . [SEP]
[CLS] these statements preceded the first law of the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mics ( 1845 ) and helped in its formulation . [SEP]
[CLS] la ##vo ##isi ##er , lap ##lace and hess also investigated specific heat and late ##nt heat , although it was joseph black who made the most important contributions to the development of late ##nt energy changes . [SEP]
[CLS] gustav ki ##rch ##hoff showed in 1858 that the variation of the heat of reaction is given by the difference in heat capacity between products and react ##ants : d ##δ ##h / dt = δ ##c . [SEP]
[CLS] integration of this equation permits the evaluation of the heat of reaction at one temperature from measurements at another temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] the measurement of heat changes is performed using cal ##ori ##metry , usually an enclosed chamber within which the change to be examined occurs . [SEP]
[CLS] the temperature of the chamber is monitored either using a the ##rm ##ometer or the ##rm ##oco ##up ##le , and the temperature plotted against time to give a graph from which fundamental quantities can be calculated . [SEP]
[CLS] modern cal ##ori ##meter ##s are frequently supplied with automatic devices to provide a quick read - out of information , one example being the differential scanning cal ##ori ##meter ( ds ##c ) . [SEP]
[CLS] several the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mic definitions are very useful in the ##rm ##oche ##mist ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] a system is the specific portion of the universe that is being studied . [SEP]
[CLS] everything outside the system is considered the surroundings or environment . [SEP]
[CLS] a system undergoes a process when one or more of its properties changes . [SEP]
[CLS] a process relates to the change of state . [SEP]
[CLS] an iso ##thermal ( same - temperature ) process occurs when temperature of the system remains constant . [SEP]
[CLS] an iso ##bari ##c ( same - pressure ) process occurs when the pressure of the system remains constant . [SEP]
[CLS] a process is adi ##aba ##tic when no heat exchange occurs . [SEP]
