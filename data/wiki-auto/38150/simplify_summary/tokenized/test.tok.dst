[CLS] lo ##hen ##grin , w ##w ##v 75 , is a romantic opera in three acts composed and written by richard wagner , first performed in 1850 . [SEP]
[CLS] the story of the eponymous character is taken from medieval german romance , notably the " par ##zi ##val " of wolf ##ram von es ##chen ##bach and its sequel , " lo ##hen ##grin " , written by a different author , itself inspired by the epic of " ga ##rin le lo ##her ##ain " . [SEP]
[CLS] it is part of the knight of the swan tradition . [SEP]
[CLS] the opera has inspired other works of art . [SEP]
[CLS] king ludwig ii of bavaria named his fairy - tale castle ne ##us ##ch ##wan ##stein castle after the swan knight . [SEP]
[CLS] it was king ludwig ' s patronage that later gave wagner the means and opportunity to compose , build a theatre for , and stage his epic cycle " the ring of the ni ##bel ##ung " . [SEP]
[CLS] the most popular and recognizable part of the opera is the br ##idal chorus , better known as " here comes the bride " , often played as a procession ##al at weddings in the west . [SEP]
[CLS] the orchestral prelude ##s to acts i and iii are also frequently performed separately as concert pieces . [SEP]
[CLS] the literary figure of lo ##hen ##grin first appeared as a supporting character in the final chapter of the medieval epic poem par ##zi ##val of wolf ##ram von es ##chen ##bach . [SEP]
[CLS] the gr ##ail knight lo ##hen ##grin , son of the gr ##ail king par ##zi ##val , is sent to the duchess of bra ##bant to defend her . [SEP]
[CLS] his protection comes under the condition that she must never ask his name . [SEP]
[CLS] if she violate ##s this requirement , he will be forced to leave her . [SEP]
[CLS] wagner took up these characters and set the " forbidden question " theme at the core of a story which makes contrasts between the god ##ly and the mundane , and between early middle age christ ##end ##om and germanic pagan ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] wagner attempted at the same time to weave elements of greek tragedy into the plot . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote the following in " mit ##te ##il ##ungen an mein ##e fr ##eu ##nde " about his lo ##hen ##grin plans : who doesn ' t know " zeus and se ##mel ##e ? " [SEP]
[CLS] the god is in love with a human woman and approaches her in human form . [SEP]
[CLS] the lover finds that she cannot recognize the god in this form , and demands that he should make the real sensual form of his being known . [SEP]
[CLS] zeus knows that she would be destroyed by the sight of his real self . [SEP]
[CLS] he suffers in this awareness , suffers knowing that he must fulfill this demand and in doing so ruin their love . [SEP]
[CLS] he will seal his own doom when the gleam of his god ##ly form destroys his lover . [SEP]
[CLS] is the man who cr ##aves for god not destroyed ? [SEP]
[CLS] in composing " lo ##hen ##grin " wagner created a new form of opera , the through - composed music drama . [SEP]
[CLS] the composition is not divided into individual numbers , but is played from scene to scene without any interruption . [SEP]
[CLS] this style of composition contrasts with that of the conventional number opera , which is divided into arias , rec ##itative ##s , and choral sections . [SEP]
[CLS] " lo ##hen ##grin " still contains lengthy performances — for example , elsa ' s " alone in dark days " and lo ##hen ##grin ' s gr ##ail aria — which ha ##rke ##n back to the classical solo aria form . [SEP]
[CLS] wagner made extensive use of lei ##tm ##ot ##ives in his composition ( for example , the gr ##ail motif first revealed in the prelude , and the " question " motif first sung by lo ##hen ##grin to elsa ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these motives allowed wagner to precisely na ##rra ##te the inner thoughts of the characters on stage , even without speech . [SEP]

[CLS] liszt initially requested wagner to carefully translate his essay on the opera from french into german , that he might be the principal and long - standing interpreter of the work – a work which , after performing , he regarded as " a sublime work from one end to the other " . [SEP]
[CLS] in their article " elsa ' s reason : on beliefs and motives in wagner ' s " lo ##hen ##grin " " , il ##ias chris ##so ##cho ##idi ##s and ste ##ffen hu ##ck propose what they describe as " a complex and psychological ##ly more compelling account of the opera . [SEP]
[CLS] elsa asks the forbidden question because she needs to confirm lo ##hen ##grin ' s belief in her innocence , a belief that or ##tr ##ud successfully er ##odes in act 2 . [SEP]
[CLS] this interpretation reveals elsa as a rational individual , upgrades the dramatic significance of the act 1 combat scene , and , more broadly , signals a return to a her ##men ##eu ##tics of wagner ##ian drama . " [SEP]
