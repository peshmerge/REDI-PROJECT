[CLS] in many countries the iso codes for the more common cu ##rre ##ncies are so well known publicly that exchange rates published in newspapers or posted in banks use only these to del ##ine ##ate the cu ##rre ##ncies , instead of translated currency names or ambiguous currency symbols . [SEP]
[CLS] iso 421 ##7 codes are used on airline tickets and international train tickets to remove any ambiguity about the price . [SEP]
[CLS] the first two letters of the code are the two letters of the iso 316 ##6 - 1 alpha - 2 country codes ( which are also used as the basis for national top - level domains on the internet ) and the third is usually the initial of the currency itself . [SEP]
[CLS] this eliminate ##s the problem caused by the names " dollar , fran ##c , pe ##so " and " pound " being used in dozens of countries , each having significantly differing values . [SEP]
[CLS] also , if a currency is rev ##al ##ue ##d , the currency code ' s last letter is changed to distinguish it from the old currency . [SEP]
[CLS] in some cases , the third letter is the initial for " new " in that country ' s language , to distinguish it from an older currency that was rev ##al ##ue ##d ; the code sometimes out ##las ##ts the usage of the term " new " itself ( for example , the code for the mexican pe ##so is mx ##n ) . [SEP]
[CLS] another example of the third letter not being the initial of the unit ' s name is eu ##r for the euro . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of an initial letter " x " for these purposes is facilitated by the iso 316 ##6 rule that no official country code beginning with x will ever be assigned . [SEP]
[CLS] iso 316 ##6 country codes beginning with " x " are used for private custom use ( reserved ) , never for official codes . [SEP]
[CLS] the inclusion of eu ( den ##oting the european union ) in the iso 316 ##6 - 1 reserved codes list , allows the euro to be coded as eu ##r rather than assigned a code beginning with x , even though it is a su ##pr ##ana ##tion ##al currency . [SEP]
[CLS] the iso 421 ##7 standard includes a crude mechanism for expressing the relationship between a major currency unit and its corresponding minor currency unit . [SEP]
[CLS] this mechanism is called the currency " expo ##nent " and assumes a base of 10 . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , usd ( the united states dollar ) is equal to 100 of its minor currency unit the " cent " . [SEP]
[CLS] usually , as with the usd , the minor currency unit has a value that is 1 / 100 of the major unit , but in some cases ( including most varieties of the dina ##r ) 1 / 1000 is used , and sometimes ratios apply which are not integer powers of 10 . [SEP]
[CLS] some cu ##rre ##ncies do not have any minor currency unit at all and these are given an expo ##nent of 0 , as with cu ##rre ##ncies whose minor units are unused due to ne ##gli ##gible value . [SEP]
[CLS] there is also a three - digit code number assigned to each currency , in the same manner as there is also a three - digit code number assigned to each country as part of iso 316 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] the iso standard does not regulate either the spa ##cing , prefix ##ing or suffix ##ing in usage of currency codes . [SEP]
[CLS] note that , as illustrated , the order is determined not by the currency , but by the native language of the document context . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1973 , the iso technical committee 68 decided to develop codes for the representation of cu ##rre ##ncies and funds for use in any application of trade , commerce or banking . [SEP]
[CLS] at the 17th session ( february 1978 ) , the related un / ec ##e group of experts agreed that the three - letter alphabet ##ic codes for international standard iso 421 ##7 , " codes for the representation of cu ##rre ##ncies and funds " , would be suitable for use in international trade . [SEP]
[CLS] the uss ( same day ) code is not in use any longer , and was removed from the list of active iso 421 ##7 codes in march 2014 . [SEP]
[CLS] as of august 2018 , there are no new codes planned to be added to the standard . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of active cu ##rre ##ncies do not have a iso 421 ##7 code , because they may be : ( 1 ) a minor currency peg ##ged at par ( 1 : 1 ) to a larger currency , even if independently regulated , ( 2 ) a currency only used for commemorative bank ##notes or coins , or ( 3 ) a currency of an un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed or partially recognized state . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , gb ##x is sometimes used ( for example on the london stock exchange ) to denote penny sterling , a subdivision of pound sterling , the currency for the united kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] the table below shows the iso currency codes of former cu ##rre ##ncies and their common names ( which do not always match the iso 421 ##7 names ) . [SEP]
