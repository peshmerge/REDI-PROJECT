[CLS] the tables , history and ongoing discussion are maintained by six inter ##bank clearing on behalf of iso and the swiss association for standardization . [SEP]
[CLS] the iso 421 ##7 code list is used in banking and business globally . [SEP]
[CLS] in many countries the iso codes for the more common cu ##rre ##ncies are so well known publicly that exchange rates published in newspapers or posted in banks use only these to del ##ine ##ate the cu ##rre ##ncies , instead of translated currency names or ambiguous currency symbols . [SEP]
[CLS] iso 421 ##7 codes are used on airline tickets and international train tickets to remove any ambiguity about the price . [SEP]
[CLS] the first two letters of the code are the two letters of the iso 316 ##6 - 1 alpha - 2 country codes ( which are also used as the basis for national top - level domains on the internet ) and the third is usually the initial of the currency itself . [SEP]
[CLS] so japan ' s currency code is jp ##y â€” jp for japan and y for yen . [SEP]
[CLS] this eliminate ##s the problem caused by the names " dollar , fran ##c , pe ##so " and " pound " being used in dozens of countries , each having significantly differing values . [SEP]
[CLS] also , if a currency is rev ##al ##ue ##d , the currency code ' s last letter is changed to distinguish it from the old currency . [SEP]
[CLS] in some cases , the third letter is the initial for " new " in that country ' s language , to distinguish it from an older currency that was rev ##al ##ue ##d ; the code sometimes out ##las ##ts the usage of the term " new " itself ( for example , the code for the mexican pe ##so is mx ##n ) . [SEP]
[CLS] other changes can be seen , however ; the russian rub ##le , for example , changed from ru ##r to rub , where the b comes from the third letter in the word " rub ##le " . [SEP]
[CLS] another example of the third letter not being the initial of the unit ' s name is eu ##r for the euro . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of an initial letter " x " for these purposes is facilitated by the iso 316 ##6 rule that no official country code beginning with x will ever be assigned . [SEP]
[CLS] because of this rule iso 421 ##7 can use " x " codes for non - country - specific cu ##rre ##ncies without risk of clash ##ing with a future country code . [SEP]
[CLS] iso 316 ##6 country codes beginning with " x " are used for private custom use ( reserved ) , never for official codes . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , the iso 316 ##6 - based nato country codes ( stan ##ag 105 ##9 , 9th edition ) use " x " codes for imaginary exercise countries ranging from xx ##b for " brown ##land " to xx ##r for " red ##land " , as well as for major commands such as xx ##e for shape or xx ##s for sac ##lan ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] the inclusion of eu ( den ##oting the european union ) in the iso 316 ##6 - 1 reserved codes list , allows the euro to be coded as eu ##r rather than assigned a code beginning with x , even though it is a su ##pr ##ana ##tion ##al currency . [SEP]
[CLS] the iso 421 ##7 standard includes a crude mechanism for expressing the relationship between a major currency unit and its corresponding minor currency unit . [SEP]
[CLS] this mechanism is called the currency " expo ##nent " and assumes a base of 10 . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , usd ( the united states dollar ) is equal to 100 of its minor currency unit the " cent " . [SEP]
[CLS] so the usd has expo ##nent 2 ( 10 to the power 2 is 100 , which is the number of cents in a dollar ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the code jp ##y ( japanese yen ) is given the expo ##nent 0 , because its minor unit , the sen , although nominally valued at 1 / 100 of a yen , is of such ne ##gli ##gible value that it is no longer used . [SEP]
[CLS] usually , as with the usd , the minor currency unit has a value that is 1 / 100 of the major unit , but in some cases ( including most varieties of the dina ##r ) 1 / 1000 is used , and sometimes ratios apply which are not integer powers of 10 . [SEP]
[CLS] ma ##uri ##tania does not use a decimal division of units , setting 1 ou ##gui ##ya ( um ) equal to 5 k ##ho ##ums , and madagascar has 1 aria ##ry = 5 ira ##im ##bil ##an ##ja . [SEP]
[CLS] some cu ##rre ##ncies do not have any minor currency unit at all and these are given an expo ##nent of 0 , as with cu ##rre ##ncies whose minor units are unused due to ne ##gli ##gible value . [SEP]
[CLS] there is also a three - digit code number assigned to each currency , in the same manner as there is also a three - digit code number assigned to each country as part of iso 316 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] this nu ##meric code is usually the same as the iso 316 ##6 - 1 nu ##meric code . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , usd ( united states dollar ) has code 840 which is also the nu ##meric code for the us ( united states ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the iso standard does not regulate either the spa ##cing , prefix ##ing or suffix ##ing in usage of currency codes . [SEP]
[CLS] note that , as illustrated , the order is determined not by the currency , but by the native language of the document context . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1973 , the iso technical committee 68 decided to develop codes for the representation of cu ##rre ##ncies and funds for use in any application of trade , commerce or banking . [SEP]
[CLS] at the 17th session ( february 1978 ) , the related un / ec ##e group of experts agreed that the three - letter alphabet ##ic codes for international standard iso 421 ##7 , " codes for the representation of cu ##rre ##ncies and funds " , would be suitable for use in international trade . [SEP]
[CLS] over time , new cu ##rre ##ncies are created and old cu ##rre ##ncies are discontinued . [SEP]
[CLS] such changes usually originate from the formation of new countries , treaties between countries on shared cu ##rre ##ncies or monetary unions , or red ##eno ##mina ##tion from an existing currency due to excessive inflation . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , the list of codes must be updated from time to time . [SEP]
[CLS] the iso 421 ##7 maintenance agency ( ma ) , six inter ##bank clearing , is responsible for maintaining the list of codes . [SEP]
[CLS] the following is a list of active codes of official iso 421 ##7 currency names . [SEP]
[CLS] in the standard the values are called " alphabet ##ic code " , " nu ##meric code " , and " minor unit " . [SEP]
[CLS] the us dollar has two codes assigned : usd and us ##n ( next day ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the uss ( same day ) code is not in use any longer , and was removed from the list of active iso 421 ##7 codes in march 2014 . [SEP]
[CLS] as of august 2018 , there are no new codes planned to be added to the standard . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of active cu ##rre ##ncies do not have a iso 421 ##7 code , because they may be : ( 1 ) a minor currency peg ##ged at par ( 1 : 1 ) to a larger currency , even if independently regulated , ( 2 ) a currency only used for commemorative bank ##notes or coins , or ( 3 ) a currency of an un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed or partially recognized state . [SEP]
[CLS] see for a list of all currently peg ##ged cu ##rre ##ncies . [SEP]
[CLS] despite having no official recognition in iso 421 ##7 , the following non - iso codes are sometimes used locally or commercially . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , gb ##x is sometimes used ( for example on the london stock exchange ) to denote penny sterling , a subdivision of pound sterling , the currency for the united kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] recently , crypt ##oc ##ur ##ren ##cies have unofficially used iso - like codes on various crypt ##oc ##ur ##ren ##cy exchanges , for instance lt ##c for lit ##ec ##oin , nm ##c for name ##co ##in and x ##rp for the x ##rp ledger . [SEP]
[CLS] six inter ##bank clearing ( a maintenance agency of iso ) is currently studying the impact and role of crypt ##oc ##ur ##ren ##cies and other independent cu ##rre ##ncies on iso 421 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of cu ##rre ##ncies had official iso 421 ##7 currency codes and currency names until their replacement by another currency . [SEP]
[CLS] the table below shows the iso currency codes of former cu ##rre ##ncies and their common names ( which do not always match the iso 421 ##7 names ) . [SEP]
