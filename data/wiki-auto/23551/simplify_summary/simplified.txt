perciformes is an order or superorder of ray-finned fish .
they are the most numerous order of vertebrates , with about 41 % of all bony fish .
this group has over 10,000 species in almost all aquatic ecosystems .
the order contains about 160 families , which is the most of any order within the vertebrates .
it is also the most variably-sized order of vertebrates .
they first appeared and diversified in the upper cretaceous .
among the well-known members of this group are perch and dartersttered percidaectylocks , sea bass and groupersttered serranidae .
the dorsal and anal fins are divided into front spiny and back soft-rayed portions , which may be partially or completely separated .
the pelvic fins usually have one spine and up to five soft rays .
scales are usually ctenoidgated rough to the touchhosh .
classification of this group is controversial .
as traditionally defined before cladistics , the perciformes are almost certainly paraphyletic .
other orders that should be included as suborders are the scorpaeniformes , tetraodontiformes , and pleuronectiformes .
of the presently recognized suborders , several may be paraphyletic , as well .
these are grouped by suborder superfamily , generally following the text " fishes of the world " .
