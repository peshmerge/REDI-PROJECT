[CLS] per ##ci ##form ##es , also called the per ##com ##or ##pha or ac ##ant ##hop ##ter ##i , is an order or super ##ord ##er of ray - finn ##ed fish . [SEP]
[CLS] if considered a single order , they are the most numerous order of ve ##rte ##brates , containing about 41 % of all bony fish . [SEP]
[CLS] this group comprises over 10 , 000 species found in almost all aquatic ecosystems . [SEP]
[CLS] the order contains about 160 families , which is the most of any order within the ve ##rte ##brates . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also the most var ##ia ##bly sized order of ve ##rte ##brates , ranging from the 7 - mm ( 1 / 4 - in ) " sc ##hin ##dler ##ia br ##ev ##ip ##ing ##uis " to the 5 - m ( 16 . 4 ft ) mar ##lin in the genus " ma ##kai ##ra " . [SEP]
[CLS] they first appeared and diversified in the late cretaceous . [SEP]
[CLS] among the well - known members of this group are perch and dart ##ers ( per ##ci ##dae ) , sea bass and group ##ers ( serra ##nidae ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the dorsal and anal fins are divided into anterior spin ##y and posterior soft - ray ##ed portions , which may be partially or completely separated . [SEP]
[CLS] the pe ##l ##vic fins usually have one spine and up to five soft rays , positioned unusually far forward under the chin or under the belly . [SEP]
[CLS] scales are usually ct ##eno ##id ( rough to the touch ) , although sometimes they are cy ##cl ##oid ( smooth to the touch ) or otherwise modified . [SEP]
[CLS] classification of this group is controversial . [SEP]
[CLS] as traditionally defined before the introduction of clad ##istic ##s , the per ##ci ##form ##es are almost certainly para ##phy ##let ##ic . [SEP]
[CLS] other orders that should possibly be included as sub ##ord ##ers are the sc ##or ##pa ##eni ##form ##es , te ##tra ##odon ##ti ##form ##es , and pl ##eur ##one ##ct ##iform ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] of the presently recognized sub ##ord ##ers , several may be para ##phy ##let ##ic , as well . [SEP]
[CLS] these are grouped by sub ##ord ##er / superfamily , generally following the text " fishes of the world " . [SEP]
