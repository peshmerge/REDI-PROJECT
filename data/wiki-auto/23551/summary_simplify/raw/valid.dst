If considered a single order, they are the most numerous order of vertebrates, containing about 41% of all bony fish.
The order contains about 160 families, which is the most of any order within the vertebrates.
They first appeared and diversified in the Late Cretaceous.
Among the well-known members of this group are perch and darters (Percidae), sea bass and groupers (Serranidae).
The dorsal and anal fins are divided into anterior spiny and posterior soft-rayed portions, which may be partially or completely separated.
The pelvic fins usually have one spine and up to five soft rays, positioned unusually far forward under the chin or under the belly.
As traditionally defined before the introduction of cladistics, the Perciformes are almost certainly paraphyletic.
Other orders that should possibly be included as suborders are the Scorpaeniformes, Tetraodontiformes, and Pleuronectiformes.
