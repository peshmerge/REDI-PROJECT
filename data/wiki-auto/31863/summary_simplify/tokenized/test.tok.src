[CLS] the ut ##erus ( from latin " ut ##erus " , plural " ut ##eri " ) or womb is a major female hormone - responsive secondary sex organ of the reproductive system in humans and most other mammals . [SEP]
[CLS] in the human , the lower end of the ut ##erus , the ce ##r ##vi ##x , opens into the va ##gina , while the upper end , the fund ##us , is connected to the fall ##op ##ian tubes . [SEP]
[CLS] it is within the ut ##erus that the fe ##tus develops during ge ##station . [SEP]
[CLS] in the human embryo , the ut ##erus develops from the para ##mes ##one ##ph ##ric duct ##s which fuse into the single organ known as a simple ##x ut ##erus . [SEP]
[CLS] the ut ##erus has different forms in many other animals and in some it exists as two separate ut ##eri known as a du ##plex ut ##erus . [SEP]
[CLS] in english , the term " ut ##erus " is used consistently within the medical and related professions , while the germanic - derived term " womb " is also commonly used in everyday contexts . [SEP]
[CLS] the ut ##erus is located within the pe ##l ##vic region immediately behind and almost overly ##ing the bladder , and in front of the si ##gm ##oid colon . [SEP]
[CLS] the ut ##erus can be divided anatomical ##ly into four regions : the fund ##us â€“ the upper ##most rounded portion of the ut ##erus , the corpus ( body ) , the ce ##r ##vi ##x , and the cervical canal . [SEP]
[CLS] the end ##ome ##tri ##um is the inner ep ##ith ##elial layer , along with its mu ##cous membrane , of the mammalian ut ##erus . [SEP]
[CLS] it has a basal layer and a functional layer ; the functional layer thick ##ens and then is sl ##ough ##ed during the men ##st ##ru ##al cycle or est ##rous cycle . [SEP]
[CLS] during pregnancy , the ut ##erine glands and blood vessels in the end ##ome ##tri ##um further increase in size and number and form the dec ##id ##ua . [SEP]
[CLS] vascular spaces fuse and become inter ##connected , forming the place ##nta , which supplies oxygen and nutrition to the embryo and fe ##tus . [SEP]
[CLS] surrounding the ut ##erus is a layer or band of fi ##bro ##us and fatty connect ##ive tissue called the para ##met ##rium that connects the ut ##erus to other tissues of the pe ##lvis . [SEP]
[CLS] com ##men ##sal organisms are present in the ut ##erus and form the ut ##erine micro ##bio ##me . [SEP]
[CLS] second ##ari ##ly , it is supported by ligament ##s , including the per ##ito ##nea ##l ligament and the broad ligament of ut ##erus . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , the long axis of the body of the ut ##erus is bent forward at the level of the internal os with the long axis of the ce ##r ##vi ##x . [SEP]
[CLS] this position is termed ant ##ef ##le ##xi ##on of the ut ##erus . [SEP]
[CLS] the ut ##erus is in the middle of the pe ##l ##vic cavity in frontal plane ( due to ligament ##um la ##tum ut ##eri ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the fund ##us does not sur ##pass the line ##a terminal ##is , while the va ##ginal part of the ce ##r ##vi ##x does not extend below inter ##sp ##inal line . [SEP]
[CLS] the ut ##erus is mobile and moves posterior ##ly under the pressure of a full bladder , or anterior ##ly under the pressure of a full rec ##tum . [SEP]
[CLS] under normal circumstances the su ##sp ##ens ##ory part keeps the ut ##erus in ant ##ef ##le ##xi ##on and ant ##ever ##sion ( in 90 % of women ) and keeps it " floating " in the pe ##lvis . [SEP]
[CLS] the su ##sten ##ta ##cular part supports the pe ##l ##vic organs and comprises the larger pe ##l ##vic dia ##ph ##rag ##m in the back and the smaller ur ##ogen ##ital dia ##ph ##rag ##m in the front . [SEP]
[CLS] in cases where the ut ##erus is " tipped " , also known as retro ##verted ut ##erus , the person may have symptoms of pain during sexual intercourse , pe ##l ##vic pain during men ##st ##ru ##ation , minor inc ##ont ##inen ##ce , ur ##ina ##ry tract infections , fertility difficulties , and difficulty using tam ##pon ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] another ana ##sto ##mot ##ic branch may also supply the ut ##erus from ana ##sto ##mos ##is of these two arteries . [SEP]
[CLS] in females , these duct ##s give rise to the fall ##op ##ian tubes and the ut ##erus . [SEP]
[CLS] in humans the lower segments of the two duct ##s fuse to form a single ut ##erus , however , in cases of ut ##erine mal ##form ##ations this development may be disturbed . [SEP]
[CLS] the different ut ##erine forms in various mammals are due to various degrees of fusion of the two muller ##ian duct ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the reproductive function of the ut ##erus is to accept a fe ##rti ##lized o ##vu ##m which passes through the ut ##ero - tuba ##l junction from the fall ##op ##ian tube . [SEP]
[CLS] the fe ##rti ##lized o ##vu ##m divides to become a blast ##oc ##yst , which implant ##s into the end ##ome ##tri ##um , and derives no ##uri ##sh ##ment from blood vessels which develop exclusively for this purpose . [SEP]
[CLS] the fe ##rti ##lized o ##vu ##m becomes an embryo , attache ##s to a wall of the ut ##erus , creates a place ##nta , and develops into a fe ##tus ( ge ##sta ##tes ) until childbirth . [SEP]
[CLS] due to anatomical barriers such as the pe ##lvis , the ut ##erus is pushed partially into the abdomen due to its expansion during pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] the ut ##erus also plays a role in sexual response , by directing blood flow to the pe ##lvis and o ##var ##ies , and to the external gen ##ital ##s , including the va ##gina , lab ##ia , and clit ##oris . [SEP]
[CLS] a h ##yst ##ere ##ct ##omy is the surgical removal of the ut ##erus which may be carried out for a number of reasons including the rid ##ding of tu ##mour ##s both benign and mali ##gnant . [SEP]
[CLS] a complete h ##yst ##ere ##ct ##omy involves the removal of the body , fund ##us , and ce ##r ##vi ##x of the ut ##erus . [SEP]
[CLS] a partial h ##yst ##ere ##ct ##omy may just involve the removal of the ut ##erine body while leaving the ce ##r ##vi ##x intact . [SEP]
[CLS] during pregnancy the growth rate of the fe ##tus can be assessed by measuring the fund ##al height . [SEP]
[CLS] in mono ##tre ##mes , mammals which lay eggs , namely the pl ##at ##yp ##us and the ec ##hid ##nas , either the term " ut ##erus " or " o ##vid ##uc ##t " is used to describe the same organ , but the egg does not develop a place ##nta within the mother and thus does not receive further no ##uri ##sh ##ment after formation and fe ##rti ##lization . [SEP]
[CLS] mars ##up ##ial embryo ##s form a cho ##rio ##vite ##llin ##e place ##nta ( which can be thought of as something between a mono ##tre ##me egg and a " true " place ##nta ) , in which the egg ' s yo ##lk sac supplies a large part of the embryo ' s nutrition but also attache ##s to the ut ##erine wall and takes nutrients from the mother ' s blood ##stream . [SEP]
[CLS] in mono ##tre ##mes ( egg - laying mammals ) such as the pl ##at ##yp ##us , the ut ##erus is du ##plex and rather than nur ##turing the embryo , secret ##es the shell around the egg . [SEP]
[CLS] in mammals , the four main forms of the ut ##erus are : du ##plex , bi ##par ##tite , bi ##cor ##nu ##ate and simple ##x . [SEP]
[CLS] humans and other higher primate ##s such as chi ##mp ##an ##zee ##s , usually have a single completely fused ut ##erus , although in some individuals the ut ##eri may not have completely fused . [SEP]
