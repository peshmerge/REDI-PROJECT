The uterus (from Latin "uterus", plural "uteri") or womb is a major female hormone-responsive secondary sex organ of the reproductive system in humans and most other mammals.
In the human, the lower end of the uterus, the cervix, opens into the vagina, while the upper end, the fundus, is connected to the fallopian tubes.
It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation.
In the human embryo, the uterus develops from the paramesonephric ducts which fuse into the single organ known as a simplex uterus.
The uterus has different forms in many other animals and in some it exists as two separate uteri known as a duplex uterus.
In English, the term "uterus" is used consistently within the medical and related professions, while the Germanic-derived term "womb" is also commonly used in everyday contexts.
The uterus is located within the pelvic region immediately behind and almost overlying the bladder, and in front of the sigmoid colon.
The uterus can be divided anatomically into four regions: the fundus – the uppermost rounded portion of the uterus, the corpus (body), the cervix, and the cervical canal.
The endometrium is the inner epithelial layer, along with its mucous membrane, of the mammalian uterus.
It has a basal layer and a functional layer; the functional layer thickens and then is sloughed during the menstrual cycle or estrous cycle.
During pregnancy, the uterine glands and blood vessels in the endometrium further increase in size and number and form the decidua.
Vascular spaces fuse and become interconnected, forming the placenta, which supplies oxygen and nutrition to the embryo and fetus.
Surrounding the uterus is a layer or band of fibrous and fatty connective tissue called the parametrium that connects the uterus to other tissues of the pelvis.
Commensal organisms are present in the uterus and form the uterine microbiome.
Secondarily, it is supported by ligaments, including the peritoneal ligament and the broad ligament of uterus.
Furthermore, the long axis of the body of the uterus is bent forward at the level of the internal os with the long axis of the cervix.
This position is termed anteflexion of the uterus.
The uterus is in the middle of the pelvic cavity in frontal plane (due to ligamentum latum uteri).
The fundus does not surpass the linea terminalis, while the vaginal part of the cervix does not extend below interspinal line.
The uterus is mobile and moves posteriorly under the pressure of a full bladder, or anteriorly under the pressure of a full rectum.
Under normal circumstances the suspensory part keeps the uterus in anteflexion and anteversion (in 90% of women) and keeps it "floating" in the pelvis.
The sustentacular part supports the pelvic organs and comprises the larger pelvic diaphragm in the back and the smaller urogenital diaphragm in the front.
In cases where the uterus is "tipped", also known as retroverted uterus, the person may have symptoms of pain during sexual intercourse, pelvic pain during menstruation, minor incontinence, urinary tract infections, fertility difficulties, and difficulty using tampons.
Another anastomotic branch may also supply the uterus from anastomosis of these two arteries.
In females, these ducts give rise to the Fallopian tubes and the uterus.
In humans the lower segments of the two ducts fuse to form a single uterus, however, in cases of uterine malformations this development may be disturbed.
The different uterine forms in various mammals are due to various degrees of fusion of the two Müllerian ducts.
The reproductive function of the uterus is to accept a fertilized ovum which passes through the utero-tubal junction from the fallopian tube.
The fertilized ovum divides to become a blastocyst, which implants into the endometrium, and derives nourishment from blood vessels which develop exclusively for this purpose.
The fertilized ovum becomes an embryo, attaches to a wall of the uterus, creates a placenta, and develops into a fetus (gestates) until childbirth.
Due to anatomical barriers such as the pelvis, the uterus is pushed partially into the abdomen due to its expansion during pregnancy.
The uterus also plays a role in sexual response, by directing blood flow to the pelvis and ovaries, and to the external genitals, including the vagina, labia, and clitoris.
A hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus which may be carried out for a number of reasons including the ridding of tumours both benign and malignant.
A complete hysterectomy involves the removal of the body, fundus, and cervix of the uterus.
A partial hysterectomy may just involve the removal of the uterine body while leaving the cervix intact.
During pregnancy the growth rate of the fetus can be assessed by measuring the fundal height.
In monotremes, mammals which lay eggs, namely the platypus and the echidnas, either the term "uterus" or "oviduct" is used to describe the same organ, but the egg does not develop a placenta within the mother and thus does not receive further nourishment after formation and fertilization.
Marsupial embryos form a choriovitelline placenta (which can be thought of as something between a monotreme egg and a "true" placenta), in which the egg's yolk sac supplies a large part of the embryo's nutrition but also attaches to the uterine wall and takes nutrients from the mother's bloodstream.
In monotremes (egg-laying mammals) such as the platypus, the uterus is duplex and rather than nurturing the embryo, secretes the shell around the egg.
In mammals, the four main forms of the uterus are: duplex, bipartite, bicornuate and simplex.
Humans and other higher primates such as chimpanzees, usually have a single completely fused uterus, although in some individuals the uteri may not have completely fused.
