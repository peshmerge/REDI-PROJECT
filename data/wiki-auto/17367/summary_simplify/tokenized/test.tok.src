[CLS] bloc ##h received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1964 ( joint with fe ##od ##or l ##yne ##n ) for discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of the cho ##les ##terol and fatty acid metabolism . [SEP]
[CLS] he was the second child of middle - class parents he ##d ##wig ( st ##rie ##mer ) and frederic ##h d . " fritz " bloc ##h . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1934 , due to the nazi persecution ##s of jews , he fled to the " sc ##h ##wei ##zer ##ische for ##sch ##ung ##sin ##sti ##tu ##t " in da ##vos , switzerland , before moving to the united states in 1936 . [SEP]
[CLS] later he was appointed to the department of biological chemistry at yale medical school . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , bloc ##h enrolled at columbia university , and received a ph . d in biochemistry in 1938 . [SEP]
[CLS] from there he went to the university of chicago and then to harvard university as higgins professor of biochemistry in 1954 , a post he held until 1982 . [SEP]
[CLS] after retirement at harvard , he served as the mack and e ##ffie campbell tyne ##r eminent scholar chair in the college of human sciences at florida state university . [SEP]
[CLS] bloc ##h shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1964 with fe ##od ##or l ##yne ##n , for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of the cho ##les ##terol and fatty acid metabolism . [SEP]
[CLS] their work showed that the body first makes sq ##ual ##ene from ace ##tate over many steps and then converts the sq ##ual ##ene to cho ##les ##terol . [SEP]
[CLS] he traced all the carbon atoms in cho ##les ##terol back to ace ##tate . [SEP]
[CLS] some of his research was conducted using radioactive ace ##tate in bread mold : this was possible because fungi also produce sq ##ual ##ene . [SEP]
[CLS] he was one of several researchers who showed that ace ##ty ##l coe ##nz ##yme a is turned into me ##val ##onic acid . [SEP]
[CLS] both bloc ##h and l ##yne ##n then showed that me ##val ##onic acid is converted into chemical ##ly active iso ##pre ##ne , the precursor to sq ##ual ##ene . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1988 , he was awarded the national medal of science . [SEP]
[CLS] bloc ##h and his wife lore te ##uts ##ch first met in munich . [SEP]
