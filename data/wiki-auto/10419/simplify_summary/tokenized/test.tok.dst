[CLS] empress sui ##ko ( [UNK] 古 天 皇 , sui ##ko - ten ##no ) ( 55 ##4 – 15 april 62 ##8 ) was the 33rd monarch of japan , according to the traditional order of succession . [SEP]
[CLS] sui ##ko reigned from 59 ##3 until her death in 62 ##8 . [SEP]
[CLS] in the history of japan , sui ##ko was the first of eight women to take on the role of empress reg ##nant . [SEP]
[CLS] the seven women sovereign ##s reigning after sui ##ko were ko ##gy ##oku / sai ##mei , ji ##to , gen ##mei , gen ##sho , ko ##ken / shot ##oku , mei ##sho and go - sakura ##mac ##hi . [SEP]
[CLS] before her ascension to the ch ##rys ##ant ##hem ##um throne , her personal name ( her " im ##ina " ) was mike ##kas ##hi ##ya - him ##e - no - mi ##koto , also called toy ##omi ##ke ka ##shi ##ki ##ya him ##e no mi ##koto . [SEP]
[CLS] empress sui ##ko had several names including princess nu ##kata ##be and ( possibly posthumous ) toy ##omi ##ke ka ##shi ##ki ##ya . [SEP]
[CLS] she was the third daughter of emperor kin ##mei . [SEP]
[CLS] her mother was so ##ga no ina ##me ' s daughter , so ##ga no kit ##ashi ##him ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] sui ##ko was the younger sister of emperor yo ##mei . [SEP]
[CLS] they had the same mother . [SEP]
[CLS] empress sui ##ko was a consort to her half - brother , emperor bid ##ats ##u , but after bid ##ats ##u ' s first wife died she became his official consort and was given the title ok ##isa ##ki ( official consort of the emperor ) . [SEP]
[CLS] she bore seven children . [SEP]
[CLS] after bid ##ats ##u ' s death , sui ##ko ' s brother , emperor yo ##mei , came to power for about two years before dying of illness . [SEP]
[CLS] upon yo ##mei ' s death , another power struggle arose between the so ##ga clan and the mono ##nob ##e clan , with the so ##gas supporting prince hats ##use ##be and the mono ##nob ##es supporting prince ana ##ho ##be . [SEP]
[CLS] the so ##gas prevailed once again and prince hats ##use ##be acc ##eded to the throne as emperor su ##shu ##n in 58 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , su ##shu ##n began to res ##ent the power of so ##ga no um ##ako , the head of the so ##ga clan , and um ##ako , perhaps out of fear that su ##shu ##n might strike first , had him assassinated by ya ##mat ##oa ##ya no ata ##iko ##ma ( 東 漢 [UNK] [UNK] ) in 59 ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] when asked to acc ##ede to the throne to fill the power vacuum that subsequently developed , sui ##ko became the first of what would be several examples in japanese history where a woman was chosen to acc ##ede to the throne to ave ##rt a power struggle . [SEP]
[CLS] sui ##ko ' s contemporary title would not have been " ten ##no " , as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of emperor ten ##mu and empress ji ##to . [SEP]
[CLS] rather , it was presumably " sum ##era ##mi ##koto " or " am ##eno ##shi ##ta shi ##ros ##him ##es ##u ok ##imi " ( 治 天 下 大 王 ) , meaning " the great queen who rules all under heaven " . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatively , sui ##ko might have been referred to as ( [UNK] 大 王 / 大 [UNK] ) or the " great queen of ya ##mat ##o " . [SEP]
[CLS] prince shot ##oku was appointed regent the following year . [SEP]
[CLS] although political power during sui ##ko ' s reign is widely viewed as having been wi ##eld ##ed by prince shot ##oku and so ##ga no um ##ako , sui ##ko was far from powerless . [SEP]
[CLS] the mere fact that she survived and her reign endured suggests she had significant political skills . [SEP]
[CLS] in 59 ##9 , an earthquake destroyed buildings throughout ya ##mat ##o province in what is now nara prefecture . [SEP]
[CLS] sui ##ko ' s refusal to grant so ##ga no um ##ako ' s request that he be granted the imperial territory known as ka ##zu ##rak ##i no ag ##ata in 62 ##4 is cited as evidence of her independence from his influence . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the many achievements under empress sui ##ko ' s reign include the official recognition of buddhism by the iss ##uance of the flourishing three treasures edict in 59 ##4 . [SEP]
[CLS] sui ##ko was also one of the first buddhist monarchs in japan and had taken the vows of a nun shortly before becoming empress . [SEP]
[CLS] the reign of this empress was marked by the opening of relations with the sui court in 600 , the adoption of the twelve level cap and rank system in 60 ##3 and the adoption of the seventeen - article constitution in 60 ##4 . [SEP]
[CLS] the adoption of the sex ##age ##nary cycle calendar ( " ji ##kka ##n jun ##ish ##i " ) in japan is attributed to empress sui ##ko in 60 ##4 . [SEP]
[CLS] at a time when imperial succession was generally determined by clan leaders , rather than the emperor , sui ##ko left only vague indications of succession to two candidates while on her death ##bed . [SEP]
[CLS] one , prince tam ##ura , was a grandson of emperor bid ##ats ##u and was supported by the main line of so ##gas , including so ##ga no emi ##shi . [SEP]
[CLS] the other , prince ya ##mas ##hiro , was a son of prince shot ##oku and had the support of some lesser members of the so ##ga clan . [SEP]
[CLS] after a brief struggle within the so ##ga clan in which one of prince ya ##mas ##hiro ' s main supporters was killed , prince tam ##ura was chosen and he acc ##eded to the throne as emperor jo ##mei in 62 ##9 . [SEP]
[CLS] empress sui ##ko ruled for 35 years . [SEP]
[CLS] although there were seven other reigning empress ##es , their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal imperial blood ##line , which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women ' s reigns were temporary and that male - only succession tradition must be maintained in the 21st century . [SEP]
[CLS] empress gen ##mei , who was followed on the throne by her daughter , empress gen ##sho , remains the sole exception to this conventional argument . [SEP]
[CLS] the actual site of sui ##ko ' s grave is known . [SEP]
[CLS] this empress is traditionally ve ##ner ##ated at a memorial shin ##to shrine ( " mis ##asa ##gi " ) at osaka . [SEP]
[CLS] the imperial household agency designate ##s this location as sui ##ko ' s mausoleum . [SEP]
[CLS] it ' s formally named " shin ##aga no ya ##mada no mis ##asa ##gi " . [SEP]
