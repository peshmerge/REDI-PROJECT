a crew is a group of people who work at a common activity .
the word has nautical resonances : the tasks involved in operating a ship , particularly a sailing ship , providing numerous specialities within a ship 's crew , often organised with a chain of command .
traditional nautical usage strongly distinguishes officers from crew , though the two groups combined form the ship 's company .
" crew " also refers to the sport of rowing .
