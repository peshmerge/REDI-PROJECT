A crew is a body or a class of people who work at a common activity, generally in a structured or hierarchical organization.
The word has nautical resonances: the tasks involved in operating a ship, particularly a sailing ship, providing numerous specialities within a ship's crew, often organised with a chain of command.
Traditional nautical usage strongly distinguishes officers from crew, though the two groups combined form the ship's company.
"Crew" also refers to the sport of rowing, where teams row competitively in racing shells.
