[CLS] interest in mars has been stimulated by the planet ' s dramatic red color , by early scientific speculation ##s that its surface conditions might be capable of supporting life , and by the possibility that mars could be colon ##ized by humans in the future . [SEP]
[CLS] almost as popular as stories about mars are stories about martian ##s engaging in activity ( frequently invasions ) away from their home planet . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 20th century , actual space ##flight ##s to the planet mars , including seminal events such as the first man - made object to impact the surface of mars in 1971 , and then later the first landing of " the first mechanized device to successfully operate on mars " in 1976 ( in the viking program by the united states ) , inspired a great deal of interest in mars - related fiction . [SEP]
[CLS] before the marine ##r 4 spacecraft arrived at mars in july 1965 and di ##sp ##elled some of the more exotic theories about the planet , the conventional image of mars was shaped by the observations of the astronomers giovanni sc ##hia ##par ##elli , camille fl ##am ##mar ##ion and percival lowell . [SEP]
[CLS] fl ##am ##mar ##ion assumed its red surface came from red - colored vegetation , and sc ##hia ##par ##elli observed what he took to be linear features on the face of mars , which he thought might be water channels . [SEP]
[CLS] it was frequently speculated that ancient martian civilizations had constructed irrigation works that spanned the planet in an attempt at saving their dying world . [SEP]
[CLS] early science fiction about mars often involved the first voyages to the planet , sometimes as an invasion force , more often for the purposes of exploration . [SEP]
[CLS] by the 1930s , stories about reaching mars had become somewhat tri ##te , and the focus shifted to mars as an alien landscape . [SEP]
[CLS] in the following stories , human contact and basic exploration had taken place sometime in the past ; mars is a setting rather than a goal . [SEP]
[CLS] no canals were found ; while scientists did not believe that mars was a moist planet , the lack of surface water surprised them . [SEP]
[CLS] science fiction had so influenced real exploration ##s of the planet , however — carl saga ##n was among the many fans who became scientists — that after marine ##r 9 in 1971 - 1972 , craters were named after wells , burroughs , and other authors . [SEP]
[CLS] the marine ##r and viking space probe ##s confirmed that the martian environment is extremely hostile to life . [SEP]
[CLS] most of these works feature humans struggling to tame the planet , and some of them refer to terra ##form ##ing ( using technology to transform a planet ' s environment to be earth ##like ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a common theme , particularly among american writers , is that of a martian colony fighting for independence from earth . [SEP]
[CLS] a historical rebellion of mars against earth is also mentioned in the " star trek " series of novels , which are not considered canon . [SEP]
[CLS] in the decades following marine ##r and apollo , the once - popular sub ##gen ##re of realistic stories about a first expedition to mars fell out of fashion , possibly due to the failure of the apollo program to continue on to mars . [SEP]
[CLS] these were followed by gregory ben ##ford ' s " the martian race " ( 1999 ) , geoffrey a . land ##is ' s " mars crossing " ( 2000 ) , and robert zu ##bri ##n ' s " first landing " ( 2002 ) , which took as their starting points the smaller and more focused expedition strategies evolved in the late 1990s , mostly building on the concepts of mars direct . [SEP]
[CLS] the martian is a favorite character of classical science fiction ; he was frequently found away from his home planet , often invading earth , but sometimes simply a lonely character representing alien ##ness from his surroundings . [SEP]
[CLS] martian ##s , other than human beings transplant ##ed to mars , became rare in fiction after marine ##r , except in exercises of deliberate nostalgia – more frequently in some genres , such as comics and animation , than in written literature . [SEP]
