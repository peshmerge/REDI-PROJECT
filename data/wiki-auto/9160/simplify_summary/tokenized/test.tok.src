[CLS] in law and government , de ju ##re ( ; , " in law " ; ] ) describes practices that are legally recognised , regardless whether the practice exists in reality . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , ( " in fact " ) describes situations that exist in reality , even if not legally recognised . [SEP]
[CLS] the terms are often used to contrast different scenarios : for a col ##lo ##qui ##al example , " i know that , de ju ##re , this is supposed to be a parking lot , but now that the flood has left four feet of water here , it ' s a de facto swimming pool " . [SEP]
[CLS] to further explain , even if the signs around the flooded parking lot say " parking lot " ( the signs effectively being the " law " determining what it is ) it is " in fact " a swimming pool ( with the water , the current practical circumstances , determining what it is ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it is possible to have multiple simultaneous conflicting ( de ju ##re ) legal ##ities , possibly none of which is in force ( de facto ) . [SEP]
[CLS] after seizing power in 152 ##6 , ahmad ibn ibrahim al - g ##ha ##zi made his brother , umar din , the lawful ( de ju ##re ) sultan of ada ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] ahmad , however , was in practice ( de facto ) the actual sultan , and his brother was a figure ##head . [SEP]
[CLS] between 1805 and 1914 , the ruling dynasty of egypt ruled as de ju ##re viceroy ##s of the ottoman empire , but acted as de facto independent rulers who maintained a polite fiction of ottoman su ##zer ##aint ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] however , from about 1882 , the rulers had only de ju ##re rule over egypt , as it had by then become a british puppet state . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , egypt was by ottoman law de ju ##re a province of the ottoman empire , but de facto was part of the british empire . [SEP]
[CLS] in u . s . law , particularly after " brown v . board of education " ( 1954 ) , the difference between de facto segregation ( segregation that existed because of the voluntary associations and neighborhoods ) and de ju ##re segregation ( segregation that existed because of local laws that mandated the segregation ) became important distinctions for court - mandated re ##media ##l purposes .
