De jure is an expression from the Latin words meaning "in law".
It is often used in contrast to "de facto" (which means "in fact", or "in practice") when talking about law, governance, or technique.
When talking about law, ""de jure"" is used to describe what the law says, and ""de facto"" is used to describe what actually happens.
