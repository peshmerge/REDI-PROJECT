[CLS] a gang ##lion is a nerve cell cluster or a group of nerve cell bodies located in the auto ##no ##mic nervous system and sensory system , mostly outside the central nervous system except certain nuclei . [SEP]
[CLS] gang ##lia house the cell bodies of af ##fer ##ent nerves ( input nerve fibers ) and e ##ffer ##ent nerves ( output / motor nerve fibers ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a pseudo ##gang ##lion looks like a gang ##lion , but only has nerve fibers and has no nerve cell bodies . [SEP]
[CLS] gang ##lia are primarily made up of so ##mata and den ##dr ##itic structures which are bundled or connected . [SEP]
[CLS] gang ##lia often inter ##con ##ne ##ct with other gang ##lia to form a complex system of gang ##lia known as a pl ##ex ##us . [SEP]
[CLS] gang ##lia provide relay points and inter ##media ##ry connections between different neurological structures in the body , such as the peripheral and central nervous systems . [SEP]
[CLS] in the auto ##no ##mic nervous system , fibers from the central nervous system to the gang ##lia are known as pre ##gang ##lion ##ic fibers , while those from the gang ##lia to the effect ##or organ are called post ##gang ##lion ##ic fibers . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " gang ##lion " refers to the peripheral nervous system . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in the brain ( part of the central nervous system ) , the " basal gang ##lia " is a group of nuclei inter ##connected with the cerebral cortex , tha ##lam ##us , and brains ##tem , associated with a variety of functions : motor control , cognition , emotions , and learning . [SEP]
[CLS] partly due to this ambiguity , the term ##ino ##log ##ia ana ##tom ##ica recommends using the term basal nuclei instead of basal gang ##lia ; however , this usage has not been generally adopted . [SEP]
[CLS] a pseudo ##gang ##lion is a localized thick ##ening of the main part or trunk of a nerve that has the appearance of a gang ##lion but has only nerve fibers and no nerve cell bodies . [SEP]
[CLS] pseudo ##gang ##lia are found in the ter ##es minor muscle and radial nerve . [SEP]
