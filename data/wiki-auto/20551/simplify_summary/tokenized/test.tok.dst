[CLS] the majority of delegation ##s at the international conference of american states represented independent states that had emerged from former colonies . [SEP]
[CLS] in most cases , their own existence and independence had been disputed , or opposed , by one or more of the european colonial empires . [SEP]
[CLS] they agreed among themselves to criteria that made it easier for other dependent states with limited sovereignty to gain international recognition . [SEP]
[CLS] the convention sets out the definition , rights and duties of statehood . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , the first sentence of article 3 explicitly states that " the political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states . " [SEP]
[CLS] this is known as the dec ##lar ##ative theory of statehood . [SEP]

[CLS] switzerland , although not a member of the european union , adhere ##s to the same principle , stating that " neither a political unit needs to be recognized to become a state , nor does a state have the obligation to recognize another one . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time , neither recognition is enough to create a state , nor does its absence ab ##olis ##h it . " [SEP]
