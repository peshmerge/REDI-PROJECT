[CLS] article six of the united states constitution establishes the laws and treaties of the united states made in accordance with it as the supreme law of the land , forbid ##s a religious test as a requirement for holding a governmental position , and holds the united states under the constitution responsible for debts incurred by the united states under the articles of confederation . [SEP]
[CLS] the first clause of the article provides that debts contracted prior to the adoption of the constitution remain valid , as they were under the articles of confederation . [SEP]
[CLS] clause two provides that the constitution , federal laws made pursuant to it , and treaties made under its authority constitute the supreme law of the land . [SEP]
[CLS] it provides that state courts are bound by the supreme law ; in case of conflict between federal and state law , the federal law must be applied . [SEP]
[CLS] even state constitution ##s are subordinate to federal law . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court under john marshall ( the marshall court ) was influential in con ##st ##ru ##ing the supremacy clause . [SEP]
[CLS] it first ruled that it had the power to review the decisions of state courts allegedly in conflict with the supreme law , claims of " state sovereignty " notwithstanding . [SEP]
[CLS] in " martin v . hunter ' s less ##ee " ( 1816 ) , the supreme court confronted the chief justice of virginia , spencer ro ##ane , who had previously declared a supreme court decision unconstitutional and refused to permit the state courts to ab ##ide by it . [SEP]
[CLS] the court upheld the judiciary act , which permitted it to hear appeals from state courts , on the grounds that congress had passed it under the supremacy clause . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court has also struck down attempts by states to control or direct the affairs of federal institutions . [SEP]
[CLS] " mcc ##ull ##och v . maryland " ( 1819 ) was a significant case in this regard . [SEP]
[CLS] the state of maryland had levi ##ed a tax on banks not chartered by the state ; the tax applied , state judges ruled , to the bank of the united states chartered by congress in 1816 . [SEP]
[CLS] marshall wrote that " the states have no power , by taxation or otherwise , to re ##tar ##d , imp ##ede , burden , or in any manner control , the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by congress to carry into execution the powers vested in the general government . " [SEP]
[CLS] united states property is wholly immune to state taxation , as are government activities and institutions . [SEP]
[CLS] congress may explicitly provide immunity from taxation in certain cases , for instance by im ##mun ##izing a federal contractor . [SEP]
[CLS] federal employees , however , may not be im ##mun ##ized from taxes , as the tax would not in any way imp ##ede government activities . [SEP]
[CLS] " gibbons v . ogden " ( 1824 ) was another influential case involving the supremacy clause . [SEP]
[CLS] the state of new york had granted aaron ogden a monopoly over the steamboat business in the hudson river . [SEP]
[CLS] the other party , thomas gibbons , had obtained a federal permit under the coastal licensing act to perform the same task . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court upheld the federal permit . [SEP]
[CLS] john marshall wrote , " the null ##ity of an act , inconsistent with the constitution , is produced by the declaration , that the constitution is the supreme law . [SEP]
[CLS] the appropriate application of that part of the clause which con ##fers the same supremacy on laws and treaties , is to such acts of the state legislatures as do not trans ##cend their powers , but though enacted in the execution of acknowledged state powers , interfere with , or are contrary to the laws of congress , made in pu ##rs ##uance of the constitution , or some treaty made under the authority of the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] in every such case , the act of congress , or the treaty , is supreme ; and the law of the state , though enacted in the exercise of powers not con ##tro ##verted , must yield to it . " [SEP]
[CLS] " reid v . covert " ( 1957 ) ruled that no branch of the united states government can have powers conferred upon it by treaty that have not been conferred by the united states constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] federal and state legislators , executive officers and judges are , by the third clause of the article , bound by oath or af ##firm ##ation to support the constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] congress may determine the form of such an oath . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court found that the law constituted an unconstitutional " ex post facto " law , for it retro ##active ##ly punished the offenses mentioned in the oath by preventing those who committed them from taking office . [SEP]
[CLS] congress may not require religious tests for an office under the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , congress may include the customary words " so help me god " in an oath , but an individual would be under no compulsion to utter them , as such a requirement would constitute a religious test . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1960 presidential campaign , the issue of whether the nation would for the first time elect a catholic to the highest office in the land raised the spec ##ter of an implicit , but no less effective , religious test . [SEP]
[CLS] john f . kennedy , in his on 12 september 1960 , addressed the question directly , saying , [SEP]
