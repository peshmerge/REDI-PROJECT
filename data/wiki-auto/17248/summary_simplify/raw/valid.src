Keflavík (pronounced ] , meaning "Driftwood Bay") is a town in the Reykjanes region in southwest Iceland.
Later its growth continued from flight operations at the Keflavík International Airport which was built by the United States military during the 1940s.
The airport used to hold a significant NATO military base and was a vital pre-jet refueling stop for trans-Atlantic commercial air traffic.
During World War II the military airfield served as a refueling and transit depot.
During the Cold War, Naval Air Station Keflavik played an important role in monitoring marine and submarine traffic from the Norwegian and Greenland Seas into the Atlantic Ocean.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the base's role was cast into doubt.
In Iceland, Keflavík was renowned as a rich source of musicians during the 1960s and 70s, and is therefore also known as "bítlabærinn" or "The Beatle Town".
The local geography is dominated by fields of basalt rubble, interspersed with a few hardy plants and mosses.
There is no truly dry month but July is the month that gets the least amount of precipitation.
The warmest month on average is July with an average high of 13 C and the coldest is January with an average high of 2 C .
The town is represented in sports by Íþrótta- og ungmennafélag Keflavíkur.
The former NATO military base Naval Air Station Keflavik is used as a setting for an important story line in Tom Clancy's novel "Red Storm Rising".
