The 1st century was the century AD 1 to AD 100 according to the Julian calendar.
It is often written as the 1st century AD or 1st century CE to distinguish it from the 1st century BC (or BCE) which preceded it.
During this period, Europe, North Africa and the Near East fell under increasing domination by the Roman Empire, which continued expanding, most notably conquering Britain under the emperor Claudius (AD 43).
The reforms introduced by Augustus during his long reign stabilized the empire after the turmoil of the previous century's civil wars.
Later in the century the Julio-Claudian dynasty, which had been founded by Augustus, came to an end with the suicide of Nero in AD 68.
There followed the famous Year of Four Emperors, a brief period of civil war and instability, which was finally brought to an end by Vespasian, ninth Roman emperor, and founder of the Flavian dynasty.
The 1st century saw the appearance of Christianity.
