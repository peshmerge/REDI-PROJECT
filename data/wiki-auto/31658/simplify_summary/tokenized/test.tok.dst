[CLS] the sixth amendment ( amendment vi ) to the united states constitution sets forth rights related to criminal prosecution ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it was ratified in 1791 as part of the united states bill of rights . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court has applied most of the protections of this amendment to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment . [SEP]
[CLS] the sixth amendment grants criminal defendants the right to a speedy and public trial by an imp ##art ##ial jury consisting of ju ##ror ##s from the state and district in which the crime was alleged to have been committed . [SEP]
[CLS] under the imp ##art ##ial jury requirement , ju ##ror ##s must be un ##bia ##sed , and the jury must consist of a representative cross - section of the community . [SEP]
[CLS] the right to a jury only applies to offenses in which the penalty is imprisonment for longer than six months . [SEP]
[CLS] in " barker v . wing ##o " , the supreme court articulated a balancing test to determine whether a defendant ' s right to a speedy trial had been violated , and held that any delay of longer than a year would be " pre ##sum ##ptive ##ly " ( but not absolutely ) pre ##ju ##dic ##ial . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court has held that the requirement of a public trial is not absolute , and that both the government and the defendant can in some cases request a closed trial . [SEP]
[CLS] the sixth amendment requires that criminal defendants be given notice of the nature and cause of accusations against them . [SEP]
[CLS] the amendment ' s confrontation clause gives criminal defendants the right to confront and cross - examine witnesses , while the compulsory process clause gives criminal defendants the right to call their own witnesses and , in some cases , com ##pel witnesses to testify . [SEP]
[CLS] the assistance of counsel clause grants criminal defendants the right to be assisted by counsel . [SEP]
[CLS] in " gideon v . wainwright " and subsequent cases , the supreme court held that a public defender must be provided to criminal defendants unable to afford an attorney in all trials where the defendant faces the possibility of imprisonment . [SEP]
[CLS] criminal defendants have the right to a speedy trial . [SEP]
[CLS] in " barker v . wing ##o " , 407 u . s . 51 ##4 ( 1972 ) , the supreme court laid down a four - part case - by - case balancing test for determining whether the defendant ' s speedy trial right has been violated . [SEP]
[CLS] in " st ##run ##k v . united states " , 412 u . s . 43 ##4 ( 1973 ) , the supreme court ruled that if the reviewing court finds that a defendant ' s right to a speedy trial was violated , then the indictment must be dismissed and / or the conviction overturned . [SEP]
[CLS] the court held that , since the delayed trial is the state action which violate ##s the defendant ' s rights , no other remedy would be appropriate . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , a reversal or dismissal of a criminal case on speedy trial grounds means that no further prosecution for the alleged offense can take place . [SEP]
[CLS] in " sheppard v . maxwell " , 38 ##4 u . s . 333 ( 1966 ) , the supreme court ruled that the right to a public trial is not absolute . [SEP]
[CLS] in cases where excess publicity would serve to undermine the defendant ' s right to due process , limitations can be put on public access to the proceedings . [SEP]
[CLS] according to " press - enterprise co . v . superior court " , 47 ##8 u . s . 1 ( 1986 ) , trials can be closed at the be ##hes ##t of the government if there is " an over ##riding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest . " [SEP]
[CLS] the accused may also request a closure of the trial ; though , it must be demonstrated that " first , there is a substantial probability that the defendant ' s right to a fair trial will be prejudice ##d by publicity that closure would prevent , and second , reasonable alternatives to closure cannot adequately protect the defendant ' s right to a fair trial . " [SEP]
[CLS] the right to a jury has always depended on the nature of the offense with which the defendant is charged . [SEP]
[CLS] petty offenses — those punish ##able by imprisonment for no more than six months — are not covered by the jury requirement . [SEP]
[CLS] even where multiple petty offenses are concerned , the total time of imprisonment possibly exceeding six months , the right to a jury trial does not exist . [SEP]
[CLS] also , in the united states , except for serious offenses ( such as murder ) , minors are usually tried in a juvenile court , which less ##ens the sentence allowed , but for ##feit ##s the right to a jury . [SEP]
[CLS] originally , the supreme court held that the sixth amendment right to a jury trial indicated a right to " a trial by jury as understood and applied at common law , and includes all the essential elements as they were recognized in this country and england when the constitution was adopted . " [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , it was held that ju ##ries had to be composed of twelve persons and that verdict ##s had to be unanimous , as was customary in england . [SEP]
[CLS] when , under the fourteenth amendment , the supreme court extended the right to a trial by jury to defendants in state courts , it re - examined some of the standards . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been held that twelve came to be the number of ju ##ror ##s by " historical accident , " and that a jury of six would be sufficient , but anything less would de ##pr ##ive the defendant of a right to trial by jury . [SEP]
[CLS] the sixth amendment mandates una ##ni ##mity in a federal jury trial . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the supreme court has ruled that the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment , while requiring states to provide jury trials for serious crimes , does not incorporate all the elements of a jury trial within the meaning of the sixth amendment . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , states are not mandated to require jury una ##ni ##mity , unless the jury has only six members . [SEP]
[CLS] the sixth amendment requires ju ##ries to be imp ##art ##ial . [SEP]
[CLS] imp ##art ##ial ##ity has been interpreted as requiring individual ju ##ror ##s to be un ##bia ##sed . [SEP]
[CLS] at " vo ##ir dire , " each side may question potential ju ##ror ##s to determine any bias , and challenge them if the same is found ; the court determines the validity of these challenges for cause . [SEP]
[CLS] defendants may not challenge a conviction because a challenge for cause was denied incorrectly if they had the opportunity to use pere ##mpt ##ory challenges . [SEP]
[CLS] in " pena - rodriguez v . colorado " ( 2017 ) , the supreme court ruled that the sixth amendment requires a court in a criminal trial to investigate whether a jury ' s guilty verdict was based on racial bias . [SEP]
[CLS] for a guilty verdict to be set aside based on the racial bias of a ju ##ror , the defendant must prove that the racial bias " was a significant mo ##tiv ##ating factor in the ju ##ror ' s vote to convict . " [SEP]
[CLS] another factor in determining the imp ##art ##ial ##ity of the jury is the nature of the panel , or ve ##nir ##e , from which the ju ##ror ##s are selected . [SEP]
[CLS] ve ##nir ##es must represent a fair cross - section of the community ; the defendant might establish that the requirement was violated by showing that the allegedly excluded group is a " distinctive " one in the community , that the representation of such a group in ve ##nir ##es is unreasonable and unfair in regard to the number of persons belonging to such a group , and that the under - representation is caused by a systematic exclusion in the selection process . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , in " taylor v . louisiana " , 41 ##9 u . s . 52 ##2 ( 1975 ) , the supreme court invalid ##ated a state law that exempt ##ed women who had not made a declaration of willingness to serve from jury service , while not doing the same for men . [SEP]
[CLS] in " app ##ren ##di v . new jersey " , 530 u . s . 46 ##6 ( 2000 ) , and " blake ##ly v . washington " , 54 ##2 u . s . 296 ( 2004 ) , the supreme court ruled that a criminal defendant has a right to a jury trial not only on the question of guilt or innocence , but also regarding any fact used to increase the defendant ' s sentence beyond the maximum otherwise allowed by statutes or sentencing guidelines . [SEP]
[CLS] in " alley ##ne v . united states " , 11 - 93 ##35 ( 2013 ) , the court expanded on " app ##ren ##di " and " blake ##ly " by ruling that a defendant ' s right to a jury applies to any fact that would increase a defendant ' s sentence beyond the minimum otherwise required by statute . [SEP]
[CLS] in " united states v . hay ##mond " ( 2019 ) , the court will decide whether jury fact finding is also required if a federal supervised release rev ##ocation would carry a mandatory minimum prison sentence . [SEP]
[CLS] of the constitution requires defendants be tried by ju ##ries and in the state in which the crime was committed . [SEP]
[CLS] the sixth amendment requires the jury to be selected from judicial districts as ##cer ##tained by statute . [SEP]
[CLS] in " beaver ##s v . hen ##kel " , 194 u . s . 73 ( 1904 ) , the supreme court ruled that the place where the offense is charged to have occurred determines a trial ' s location . [SEP]
[CLS] where multiple districts are alleged to have been locations of the crime , any of them may be chosen for the trial . [SEP]
[CLS] in cases of offenses not committed in any state ( for example , offenses committed at sea ) , the place of trial may be determined by the congress . [SEP]
[CLS] a criminal defendant has the right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , an indictment must all ##ege all the ingredients of the crime to such a degree of precision that it would allow the accused to assert double jeopardy if the same charges are brought up in subsequent prosecution . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court held in " united states v . carl ##l " , 105 u . s . 61 ##1 ( 1881 ) , that " in an indictment . . . it is not sufficient to set forth the offense in the words of the statute , unless those words of themselves fully , directly , and express ##ly , without any uncertainty or ambiguity , set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished . " [SEP]
[CLS] vague word ##ing , even if taken directly from a statute , does not su ##ffi ##ce . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the government is not required to hand over written copies of the indictment free of charge . [SEP]
[CLS] the confrontation clause relates to the common law rule preventing the admission of hears ##ay , that is to say , testimony by one witness as to the statements and observations of another person to prove that the statement or observation was accurate . [SEP]
[CLS] the rational ##e was that the defendant had no opportunity to challenge the credibility of and cross - examine the person making the statements . [SEP]
[CLS] certain exceptions to the hears ##ay rule have been permitted ; for instance , admissions by the defendant are ad ##missible , as are dying declaration ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , in " california v . green " , 39 ##9 u . s . 149 ( 1970 ) , the supreme court has held that the hears ##ay rule is not the same as the confrontation clause . [SEP]
[CLS] hears ##ay is ad ##missible under certain circumstances . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in " br ##uto ##n v . united states " , 39 ##1 u . s . 123 ( 1968 ) , the supreme court ruled that while a defendant ' s out of court statements were ad ##missible in proving the defendant ' s guilt , they were ina ##dm ##iss ##ible hears ##ay against another defendant . [SEP]
[CLS] hears ##ay may , in some circumstances , be admitted though it is not covered by one of the long - recognized exceptions . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , prior testimony may sometimes be admitted if the witness is unavailable . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in " crawford v . washington " , 54 ##1 u . s . 36 ( 2004 ) , the supreme court increased the scope of the confrontation clause by ruling that " test ##imo ##nia ##l " out - of - court statements are ina ##dm ##iss ##ible if the accused did not have the opportunity to cross - examine that accuse ##r and that accuse ##r is unavailable at trial . [SEP]
[CLS] in " davis v . washington " 54 ##7 u . s . 81 ##3 ( 2006 ) , the court ruled that " test ##imo ##nia ##l " refers to any statement that an objective ##ly reasonable person in the dec ##lar ##ant ' s situation would believe likely to be used in court . [SEP]
[CLS] in " mel ##endez - diaz v . massachusetts " , 55 ##7 u . s . 305 ( 2009 ) , and " bull ##coming v . new mexico " , 56 ##4 u . s . 64 ##7 ( 2011 ) , the court ruled that admitting a lab chemist ' s analysis into evidence , without having him testify , violated the confrontation clause . [SEP]
[CLS] in " michigan v . bryant " , 56 ##2 u . s . 344 ( 2011 ) , the court ruled that the " primary purpose " of a shooting victim ' s statement as to who shot him , and the police ' s reason for questioning him , each had to be objective ##ly determined . [SEP]
[CLS] if the " primary purpose " was for dealing with an " ongoing emergency " , then any such statement was not test ##imo ##nia ##l and so the confrontation clause would not require the person making that statement to testify in order for that statement to be admitted into evidence . [SEP]
[CLS] the right to confront and cross - examine witnesses also applies to physical evidence ; the prosecution must present physical evidence to the jury , providing the defense ample opportunity to cross - examine its validity and meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] prosecution generally may not refer to evidence without first presenting it . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late 20th and early 21st century this clause became an issue in the use of the silent witness rule . [SEP]
[CLS] the compulsory process clause gives any criminal defendant the right to call witnesses in his favor . [SEP]
[CLS] if any such witness refuses to testify , that witness may be compelled to do so by the court at the request of the defendant . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in some cases the court may refuse to permit a defense witness to testify . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , if a defense lawyer fails to not ##ify the prosecution of the identity of a witness to gain a tactical advantage , that witness may be pre ##cl ##uded from testify ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] a criminal defendant has the right to be assisted by counsel . [SEP]
[CLS] in " powell v . alabama " , 287 u . s . 45 ( 1932 ) , the supreme court ruled that " in a capital case , where the defendant is unable to employ counsel , and is incapable adequately of making his own defense because of ignorance , fee ##ble minded ##ness , ill ##iter ##acy , or the like , it is the duty of the court , whether requested or not , to assign counsel for him . " [SEP]
[CLS] in " johnson v . ze ##rb ##st " , 304 u . s . 45 ##8 ( 1938 ) , the supreme court ruled that in all federal cases , counsel would have to be appointed for defendants who were too poor to hire their own . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1961 , the court extended the rule that applied in federal courts to state courts . [SEP]
[CLS] it held in " hamilton v . alabama " , 36 ##8 u . s . 52 ( 1961 ) , that counsel had to be provided at no expense to defendants in capital cases when they so requested , even if there was no " ignorance , fee ##ble minded ##ness , ill ##iter ##acy , or the like . " [SEP]
[CLS] " gideon v . wainwright " , 37 ##2 u . s . 335 ( 1963 ) , ruled that counsel must be provided to ind ##igen ##t defendants in all felony cases , over ##ru ##ling " bet ##ts v . brady " , 316 u . s . 45 ##5 ( 1942 ) , in which the court ruled that state courts had to appoint counsel only when the defendant demonstrated " special circumstances " requiring the assistance of counsel . [SEP]
[CLS] under " ar ##gers ##inger v . ham ##lin " , 407 u . s . 25 ( 1972 ) , counsel must be appointed in any case resulting in a sentence of actual imprisonment . [SEP]
[CLS] regarding sentences not immediately leading to imprisonment , the court in " scott v . illinois " , 440 u . s . 36 ##7 ( 1979 ) , ruled that counsel did not need to be appointed , but in " alabama v . shelton " , 53 ##5 u . s . 65 ##4 ( 2002 ) , the court held that a suspended sentence that may result in inca ##rce ##ration can not be imposed if the defendant did not have counsel at trial . [SEP]
[CLS] as stated in " brewer v . williams " , 430 u . s . 38 ##7 ( 1977 ) , the right to counsel " means at least that a person is entitled to the help of a lawyer at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against him , whether by formal charge , preliminary hearing , indictment , information , or ar ##rai ##gn ##ment . " [SEP]
[CLS] " brewer " goes on to conclude that once adversary proceedings have begun against a defendant , he has a right to legal assistance when the government inter ##rogate ##s him and that when a defendant is arrested , " ar ##rai ##gned on an arrest warrant before a judge " , and " committed by the court to confinement " , " there can be no doubt that judicial proceedings have been initiated . " [SEP]
[CLS] a criminal defendant may represent himself , unless a court dee ##ms the defendant to be inc ##omp ##ete ##nt to wai ##ve the right to counsel . [SEP]
[CLS] in " fare ##tta v . california " , 422 u . s . 80 ##6 ( 1975 ) , the supreme court recognized a defendant ' s right to " pro se " representation . [SEP]
[CLS] however , under " god ##ine ##z v . moran " , 50 ##9 u . s . 38 ##9 ( 1993 ) , a court that believes the defendant is less than fully competent to represent himself can require that defendant to be assisted by counsel . [SEP]
[CLS] in " martinez v . court of appeal of california " , 52 ##8 u . s . 152 ( 2000 ) , the supreme court ruled the right to " pro se " representation did not apply to appellate courts . [SEP]
[CLS] in " indiana v . edwards " , 55 ##4 u . s . 164 ( 2008 ) , the court ruled that a criminal defendant could be simultaneously competent to stand trial , but not competent to represent himself . [SEP]
[CLS] in " bounds v . smith " , 430 u . s . 81 ##7 ( 1977 ) , the supreme court held that the constitutional right of " meaningful access to the courts " can be satisfied by counsel or access to legal materials . [SEP]
[CLS] " bounds " has been interpreted by several united states courts of appeals to mean a " pro se " defendant does not have a constitutional right to access a prison law library to research his defense when access to the courts has been provided through appointed counsel . [SEP]
