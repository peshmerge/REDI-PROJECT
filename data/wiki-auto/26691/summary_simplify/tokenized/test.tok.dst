[CLS] for example , the numbers 2 , 4 , and 6 are distinct objects when considered separately , but when they are considered collectively they form a single set of size three , written { 2 , 4 , 6 } . [SEP]
[CLS] the concept of a set is one of the most fundamental in mathematics . [SEP]
[CLS] developed at the end of the 19th century , set theory is now a ubiquitous part of mathematics , and can be used as a foundation from which nearly all of mathematics can be derived . [SEP]
[CLS] in mathematics education , elementary topics from set theory such as ve ##nn diagrams are taught at a young age , while more advanced concepts are taught as part of a university degree . [SEP]
[CLS] the german word " meng ##e " , rendered as " set " in english , was coined by bernard bo ##lz ##ano in his work " the paradox ##es of the infinite " . [SEP]
[CLS] the objects that make up a set ( also known as the set ' s " elements " or " members " ) can be anything : numbers , people , letters of the alphabet , other sets , and so on . [SEP]
[CLS] sets " a " and " b " are equal if and only if they have precisely the same elements . [SEP]
[CLS] for technical reasons , cantor ' s definition turned out to be inadequate ; today , in contexts where more rig ##or is required , one can use ax ##iom ##atic set theory , in which the notion of a " set " is taken as a primitive notion and the properties of sets are defined by a collection of ax ##ioms . [SEP]
[CLS] the most basic properties are that a set can have elements , and that two sets are equal ( one and the same ) if and only if every element of each set is an element of the other ; this property is called the " extension ##ality of sets " . [SEP]
[CLS] the second way is by extension – that is , listing each member of the set . [SEP]
[CLS] in an extension ##al definition , listing a member repeatedly does not change the set , for example , the set { 11 , 6 , 6 } is identical to the set { 11 , 6 } . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , the order in which the elements of a set are listed is irrelevant ( unlike for a sequence or tu ##ple ) , so { 6 , 11 } is yet again the same set . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , the set of the first thousand positive integers may be specified extension ##ally as [SEP]
[CLS] where the el ##lip ##sis ( " . . . " ) indicates that the list continues in the obvious way . [SEP]
[CLS] the notation with brace ##s may also be used in an int ##ens ##ional specification of a set . [SEP]
[CLS] so , " e " = { playing card suits } is the set whose four members are spade ##s , diamonds , hearts , and clubs . [SEP]
[CLS] a more general form of this is set - builder notation , through which , for instance , the set " f " of the twenty smallest integers that are four less than a perfect square can be denoted [SEP]
[CLS] in this notation , the colon ( " : " ) means " such that " , and the description can be interpreted as " " f " is the set of all numbers of the form " n " − 4 , such that " n " is an integer in the range from 0 to 19 inclusive " . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes the vertical bar ( " | " ) is used instead of the colon . [SEP]
[CLS] the relationship between sets established by ⊆ is called " inclusion " or " containment " , and is given also for equal sets , that is , equality of sets is the same as mutual containment in each other : " a " ⊆ " b " and " b " ⊆ " a " is equivalent to " a " = " b " . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a unique set with no members , called the " empty set " ( or the " null set " ) , which is denoted by the symbol ∅ ( other notation ##s are used ; see empty set ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a partition of a set " s " is a set of none ##mpt ##y subset ##s of " s " such that every element " x " in " s " is in exactly one of these subset ##s , that is , any two sets of the partition contain no element in common , they are said to be " di ##s ##jo ##int " , and the union of all elements of the partition that are sets themselves , make up " s " . [SEP]
[CLS] the power set contains " s " itself and the empty set because these are both subset ##s of " s " . [SEP]
[CLS] the power set of a finite set with " n " elements has 2 elements . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the set { 1 , 2 , 3 } contains three elements , and the power set shown above contains 2 = 8 elements . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , the power set of a set is always strictly " bigger " than the original set in the sense that there is no way to pair every element of " s " with exactly one element of " p " ( " s " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] every partition of a set " s " is a subset of the powers ##et of " s " . [SEP]
[CLS] the cardinal ##ity of a set " s " , denoted | " s " | , is the number of members of " s " . [SEP]
[CLS] repeated members in an extension ##al definition are not counted , so | { blue , white , red , blue , white } | = 3 , too . [SEP]
[CLS] the cardinal ##ity of the empty set is zero . [SEP]
[CLS] though it may seem trivial , the empty set , like the number zero , is important in mathematics . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , the existence of this set is one of the fundamental concepts of ax ##iom ##atic set theory . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , the set of real numbers has greater cardinal ##ity than the set of natural numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it can be shown that the cardinal ##ity of ( which is to say , the number of points on ) a straight line is the same as the cardinal ##ity of any segment of that line , of the entire plane , and indeed of any finite - dimensional euclidean space . [SEP]
[CLS] there are some sets or kinds of sets that hold great mathematical importance and are referred to with such regular ##ity that they have acquired special names and notation ##al conventions to identify them . [SEP]
[CLS] one of these is the empty set , denoted { } or ∅ . [SEP]
[CLS] special sets of numbers include [SEP]
[CLS] each of the above sets of numbers has an infinite number of elements , and each can be considered to be a proper subset of the sets listed below it . [SEP]
[CLS] a new set can also be constructed by determining which members two sets have " in common " . [SEP]
[CLS] note that it is valid to " sub ##tra ##ct " members of a set that are not in the set , such as removing the element " green " from the set { 1 , 2 , 3 } ; doing so has no effect . [SEP]
[CLS] in certain settings all sets under discussion are considered to be subset ##s of a given universal set " u " . [SEP]
[CLS] the power set of any set becomes a boo ##lean ring with symmetric difference as the addition of the ring ( with the empty set as neutral element ) and intersection as the multiplication of the ring . [SEP]
[CLS] a new set can be constructed by ass ##oc ##iating every element of one set with every element of another set . [SEP]
[CLS] set theory is seen as the foundation from which virtually all of mathematics can be derived . [SEP]
[CLS] given this concept , we are quick to see that the set " f " of all ordered pairs ( " x " , " x " ) , where " x " is real , is quite familiar . [SEP]
[CLS] it has a domain set r and a cod ##oma ##in set that is also r , because the set of all squares is subset of the set of all real numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] the reason these two are equivalent is for any given value , " y " that the function is defined for , its corresponding ordered pair , ( " y " , " y " ) is a member of the set " f " . [SEP]
[CLS] it was important to free set theory of these paradox ##es because nearly all of mathematics was being red ##efined in terms of set theory . [SEP]
[CLS] in an attempt to avoid these paradox ##es , set theory was ax ##iom ##ati ##zed based on first - order logic , and thus ax ##iom ##atic set theory was born . [SEP]
[CLS] the inclusion – exclusion principle is a counting technique that can be used to count the number of elements in a union of two sets , if the size of each set and the size of their intersection are known . [SEP]
[CLS] if a and b are any two sets then , the complement of a union b equals the complement of a intersect ##ed with the complement of b . [SEP]
[CLS] the complement of a intersect ##ed with b is equal to the complement of a union to the complement of b . [SEP]
