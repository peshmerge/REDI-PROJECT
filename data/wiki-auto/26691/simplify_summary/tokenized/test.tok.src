[CLS] in mathematics , a set is a collection of distinct objects , considered as an object in its own right . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the numbers 2 , 4 , and 6 are distinct objects when considered separately , but when they are considered collectively they form a single set of size three , written { 2 , 4 , 6 } . [SEP]
[CLS] the concept of a set is one of the most fundamental in mathematics . [SEP]
[CLS] developed at the end of the 19th century , set theory is now a ubiquitous part of mathematics , and can be used as a foundation from which nearly all of mathematics can be derived . [SEP]
[CLS] in mathematics education , elementary topics from set theory such as ve ##nn diagrams are taught at a young age , while more advanced concepts are taught as part of a university degree . [SEP]
[CLS] the german word " meng ##e " , rendered as " set " in english , was coined by bernard bo ##lz ##ano in his work " the paradox ##es of the infinite " . [SEP]
[CLS] a set is a well - defined collection of distinct objects . [SEP]
[CLS] the objects that make up a set ( also known as the set ' s " elements " or " members " ) can be anything : numbers , people , letters of the alphabet , other sets , and so on . [SEP]
[CLS] sets are conventional ##ly denoted with capital letters . [SEP]
[CLS] sets " a " and " b " are equal if and only if they have precisely the same elements . [SEP]
[CLS] for technical reasons , cantor ' s definition turned out to be inadequate ; today , in contexts where more rig ##or is required , one can use ax ##iom ##atic set theory , in which the notion of a " set " is taken as a primitive notion and the properties of sets are defined by a collection of ax ##ioms . [SEP]
[CLS] the most basic properties are that a set can have elements , and that two sets are equal ( one and the same ) if and only if every element of each set is an element of the other ; this property is called the " extension ##ality of sets " . [SEP]
[CLS] there are two ways of describing , or specify ##ing the members of , a set . [SEP]
[CLS] the second way is by extension – that is , listing each member of the set . [SEP]
[CLS] one often has the choice of specify ##ing a set either int ##ens ##ional ##ly or extension ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] in the examples above , for instance , " a " = " c " and " b " = " d " . [SEP]
[CLS] in an extension ##al definition , listing a member repeatedly does not change the set , for example , the set { 11 , 6 , 6 } is identical to the set { 11 , 6 } . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , the order in which the elements of a set are listed is irrelevant ( unlike for a sequence or tu ##ple ) , so { 6 , 11 } is yet again the same set . [SEP]
[CLS] for sets with many elements , the en ##ume ##ration of members can be abbreviated . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , the set of the first thousand positive integers may be specified extension ##ally as [SEP]
[CLS] where the el ##lip ##sis ( " . . . " ) indicates that the list continues in the obvious way . [SEP]
[CLS] the notation with brace ##s may also be used in an int ##ens ##ional specification of a set . [SEP]
[CLS] in this usage , the brace ##s have the meaning " the set of all . . . " . [SEP]
[CLS] so , " e " = { playing card suits } is the set whose four members are spade ##s , diamonds , hearts , and clubs . [SEP]
[CLS] a more general form of this is set - builder notation , through which , for instance , the set " f " of the twenty smallest integers that are four less than a perfect square can be denoted [SEP]
[CLS] in this notation , the colon ( " : " ) means " such that " , and the description can be interpreted as " " f " is the set of all numbers of the form " n " − 4 , such that " n " is an integer in the range from 0 to 19 inclusive " . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes the vertical bar ( " | " ) is used instead of the colon . [SEP]
[CLS] if " b " is a set and " x " is one of the objects of " b " , this is denoted as " x " ∈ " b " , and is read as " x is an element of b " , as " x belongs to b " , or short " x is in b " . [SEP]
[CLS] if " y " is not a member of " b " then this is written as " y " ∈ " b " , read as " y is not an element of b " , or as analogous ne ##gated forms . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , with respect to the sets " a " = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 } , " b " = { blue , white , red } , and " f " = { " n " − 4 : " n " is an integer , and 0 ≤ " n " ≤ 19 } defined above , [SEP]
[CLS] if every element of set " a " is also in " b " , then " a " is said to be a " subset " of " b " , written " a " ⊆ " b " ( pronounced " a is contained in b " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] equivalent ##ly , one can write " b " [UNK] " a " , read as " b is a super ##set of a " , " b includes a " , or " b contains a " . [SEP]
[CLS] the relationship between sets established by ⊆ is called " inclusion " or " containment " , and is given also for equal sets , that is , equality of sets is the same as mutual containment in each other : " a " ⊆ " b " and " b " ⊆ " a " is equivalent to " a " = " b " . [SEP]
[CLS] if " a " is a subset of " b " , but not equal to " b " , then " a " is called a " proper subset " of " b " , written " a " [UNK] " b " , or simply " a " ⊂ " b " ( " a is a proper subset of b " ) , or " b " [UNK] " a " ( " b is a proper super ##set of a " , " b " [UNK] " a " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the expressions " a " ⊂ " b " and " b " [UNK] " a " are used differently by different authors ; some authors use them to mean the same as " a " ⊆ " b " ( respectively " b " [UNK] " a " ) , whereas others use them to mean the same as " a " [UNK] " b " ( respectively " b " [UNK] " a " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a unique set with no members , called the " empty set " ( or the " null set " ) , which is denoted by the symbol ∅ ( other notation ##s are used ; see empty set ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a partition of a set " s " is a set of none ##mpt ##y subset ##s of " s " such that every element " x " in " s " is in exactly one of these subset ##s , that is , any two sets of the partition contain no element in common , they are said to be " di ##s ##jo ##int " , and the union of all elements of the partition that are sets themselves , make up " s " . [SEP]
[CLS] the power set of a set " s " is the set of all subset ##s of " s " . [SEP]
[CLS] the power set contains " s " itself and the empty set because these are both subset ##s of " s " . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the power set of the set { 1 , 2 , 3 } is { { 1 , 2 , 3 } , { 1 , 2 } , { 1 , 3 } , { 2 , 3 } , { 1 } , { 2 } , { 3 } , ∅ } . [SEP]
[CLS] the power set of a set " s " is usually written as " p " ( " s " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the power set of a finite set with " n " elements has 2 elements . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the set { 1 , 2 , 3 } contains three elements , and the power set shown above contains 2 = 8 elements . [SEP]
[CLS] the power set of an infinite ( either count ##able or un ##co ##unt ##able ) set is always un ##co ##unt ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , the power set of a set is always strictly " bigger " than the original set in the sense that there is no way to pair every element of " s " with exactly one element of " p " ( " s " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] ( there is never an onto map or sur ##ject ##ion from " s " onto " p " ( " s " ) . ) [SEP]
[CLS] every partition of a set " s " is a subset of the powers ##et of " s " . [SEP]
[CLS] the cardinal ##ity of a set " s " , denoted | " s " | , is the number of members of " s " . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , if " b " = { blue , white , red } , then | b | = 3 . [SEP]
[CLS] repeated members in an extension ##al definition are not counted , so | { blue , white , red , blue , white } | = 3 , too . [SEP]
[CLS] the cardinal ##ity of the empty set is zero . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the set of all three - sided squares has zero members and thus is the empty set . [SEP]
[CLS] though it may seem trivial , the empty set , like the number zero , is important in mathematics . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , the existence of this set is one of the fundamental concepts of ax ##iom ##atic set theory . [SEP]
[CLS] some sets have infinite cardinal ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] the set n of natural numbers , for instance , is infinite . [SEP]
[CLS] some infinite cardinal ##ities are greater than others . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , the set of real numbers has greater cardinal ##ity than the set of natural numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it can be shown that the cardinal ##ity of ( which is to say , the number of points on ) a straight line is the same as the cardinal ##ity of any segment of that line , of the entire plane , and indeed of any finite - dimensional euclidean space . [SEP]
[CLS] there are some sets or kinds of sets that hold great mathematical importance and are referred to with such regular ##ity that they have acquired special names and notation ##al conventions to identify them . [SEP]
[CLS] one of these is the empty set , denoted { } or ∅ . [SEP]
[CLS] a set with exactly one element , " x " , is a unit set , or singleton , { " x " } . [SEP]
[CLS] many of these sets are represented using black ##board bold or bold type ##face . [SEP]
[CLS] special sets of numbers include [SEP]
[CLS] each of the above sets of numbers has an infinite number of elements , and each can be considered to be a proper subset of the sets listed below it . [SEP]
[CLS] the prime ##s are used less frequently than the others outside of number theory and related fields . [SEP]
[CLS] positive and negative sets are sometimes denoted by super ##script plus and minus signs , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , q represents the set of positive rational numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] there are several fundamental operations for constructing new sets from given sets . [SEP]
[CLS] two sets can be " added " together . [SEP]
[CLS] the " union " of " a " and " b " , denoted by " a " ∪ " b " , is the set of all things that are members of either " a " or " b " . [SEP]
[CLS] a new set can also be constructed by determining which members two sets have " in common " . [SEP]
[CLS] the " intersection " of " a " and " b " , denoted by " a " ∩ " b " , is the set of all things that are members of both " a " and " b " . [SEP]
[CLS] if " a " ∩ " b " = ∅ , then " a " and " b " are said to be " di ##s ##jo ##int " . [SEP]
[CLS] two sets can also be " sub ##tracted " . [SEP]
[CLS] the " relative complement " of " b " in " a " ( also called the " set - theo ##ret ##ic difference " of " a " and " b " ) , denoted by " a " \ " b " ( or " a " − " b " ) , is the set of all elements that are members of " a " but not members of " b " . [SEP]
[CLS] note that it is valid to " sub ##tra ##ct " members of a set that are not in the set , such as removing the element " green " from the set { 1 , 2 , 3 } ; doing so has no effect . [SEP]
[CLS] in certain settings all sets under discussion are considered to be subset ##s of a given universal set " u " . [SEP]
[CLS] in such cases , " u " \ " a " is called the " absolute complement " or simply " complement " of " a " , and is denoted by " a " ′ . [SEP]
[CLS] an extension of the complement is the symmetric difference , defined for sets " a " , " b " as for example , the symmetric difference of { 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 } and { 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 } is the set { 7 , 8 , 11 , 12 } . [SEP]
[CLS] the power set of any set becomes a boo ##lean ring with symmetric difference as the addition of the ring ( with the empty set as neutral element ) and intersection as the multiplication of the ring . [SEP]
[CLS] a new set can be constructed by ass ##oc ##iating every element of one set with every element of another set . [SEP]
[CLS] the " cart ##esian product " of two sets " a " and " b " , denoted by " a " × " b " is the set of all ordered pairs ( " a " , " b " ) such that " a " is a member of " a " and " b " is a member of " b " . [SEP]
[CLS] set theory is seen as the foundation from which virtually all of mathematics can be derived . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , structures in abstract algebra , such as groups , fields and rings , are sets closed under one or more operations . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the main applications of naive set theory is constructing relations . [SEP]
[CLS] a relation from a domain " a " to a cod ##oma ##in " b " is a subset of the cart ##esian product " a " × " b " . [SEP]
[CLS] given this concept , we are quick to see that the set " f " of all ordered pairs ( " x " , " x " ) , where " x " is real , is quite familiar . [SEP]
[CLS] it has a domain set r and a cod ##oma ##in set that is also r , because the set of all squares is subset of the set of all real numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] if placed in functional notation , this relation becomes " f " ( " x " ) = " x " . [SEP]
[CLS] the reason these two are equivalent is for any given value , " y " that the function is defined for , its corresponding ordered pair , ( " y " , " y " ) is a member of the set " f " . [SEP]
[CLS] although initially naive set theory , which defines a set merely as " any well - defined " collection , was well accepted , it soon ran into several obstacles . [SEP]
[CLS] the reason is that the phrase " well - defined " is not very well - defined . [SEP]
[CLS] it was important to free set theory of these paradox ##es because nearly all of mathematics was being red ##efined in terms of set theory . [SEP]
[CLS] in an attempt to avoid these paradox ##es , set theory was ax ##iom ##ati ##zed based on first - order logic , and thus ax ##iom ##atic set theory was born . [SEP]
[CLS] for most purposes , however , naive set theory is still useful . [SEP]
[CLS] the inclusion – exclusion principle is a counting technique that can be used to count the number of elements in a union of two sets , if the size of each set and the size of their intersection are known . [SEP]
[CLS] it can be expressed symbolic ##ally as [SEP]
[CLS] augustus de morgan stated two laws about sets . [SEP]
[CLS] if a and b are any two sets then , the complement of a union b equals the complement of a intersect ##ed with the complement of b . [SEP]
[CLS] the complement of a intersect ##ed with b is equal to the complement of a union to the complement of b . [SEP]
