[CLS] abstraction in its main sense is a conceptual process where general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples , literal ( " real " or " concrete " ) sign ##ifiers , first principles , or other methods . [SEP]
[CLS] conceptual abstraction ##s may be formed by filtering the information content of a concept or an ob ##ser ##vable phenomenon , selecting only the aspects which are relevant for a particular subjective ##ly valued purpose . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , abstract ##ing a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a ball selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior , excluding , but not eliminating , the other phenomena ##l and cognitive characteristics of that particular ball . [SEP]
[CLS] abstraction in its secondary use is a material process , discussed in the themes below . [SEP]
[CLS] its development is likely to have been closely connected with the development of human language , which ( whether spoken or written ) appears to both involve and facilitate abstract thinking . [SEP]
[CLS] " abstraction " involves induction of ideas or the synthesis of particular facts into one general theory about something . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the opposite of " specification " , which is the analysis or breaking - down of a general idea or abstraction into concrete facts . [SEP]
[CLS] abstraction can be illustrated with francis bacon ' s " nov ##um organ ##um " ( 1620 ) , a book of modern scientific philosophy written in the late jacob ##ean era of england to encourage modern thinkers to collect specific facts before making any general ##izations . [SEP]
[CLS] bacon used and promoted induction as an abstraction tool , and it countered the ancient de ##ductive - thinking approach that had dominated the intellectual world since the times of greek philosophers like tha ##les , ana ##xi ##man ##der , and aristotle . [SEP]
[CLS] modern scientists can also use the opposite approach of abstraction , or going from particular facts collected into one general idea , such as the motion of the planets ( newton ( 1642 – 1727 ) ) . [SEP]
[CLS] an abstraction can be seen as a compression process , mapping multiple different pieces of constituent data to a single piece of abstract data ; based on similarities in the constituent data , for example , many different physical cats map to the abstraction " cat " . [SEP]
[CLS] this conceptual scheme emphasizes the inherent equality of both constituent and abstract data , thus avoiding problems arising from the distinction between " abstract " and " concrete " . [SEP]
[CLS] in this sense the process of abstraction en ##tails the identification of similarities between objects , and the process of ass ##oc ##iating these objects with an abstraction ( which is itself an object ) . [SEP]
[CLS] by contrast , instances , or members , of such an abstract thing might exist in many different places and times . [SEP]
[CLS] doing so would make the concepts " cat " and " telephone " abstract ideas since despite their varying appearances , a particular cat or a particular telephone is an instance of the concept " cat " or the concept " telephone " . [SEP]
[CLS] still retaining the primary meaning of ' abs ##tre ##re ' or ' to draw away from ' , the abstraction of money , for example , works by drawing away from the particular value of things allowing completely inc ##om ##men ##sur ##ate objects to be compared ( see the section on ' physical ##ity ' below ) . [SEP]
[CLS] conceptual ##ly , ' the current concept of the state is an abstraction from the much more concrete early - modern use as the standing or status of the prince , his visible estates ' . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time , material ##ly , the ' practice of statehood is now con ##sti ##tu ##tively and material ##ly more abstract than at the time when princes ruled as the em ##bo ##diment of extended power ' . [SEP]
[CLS] the way that physical objects , like rocks and trees , have being differs from the way that properties of abstract concepts or relations have being , for example the way the concrete , particular , individuals pictured in " picture 1 " exist differs from the way the concepts illustrated in " graph 1 " exist . [SEP]
[CLS] the word applies to properties and relations to mark the fact that , if they exist , they do not exist in space or time , but that instances of them can exist , potentially in many different places and times . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in the secondary sense of the term ' abstraction ' , this physical object can carry material ##ly abstract ##ing processes . [SEP]
[CLS] which represented counts of items , probably livestock or grains , sealed in containers . [SEP]
[CLS] according to , these clay containers contained token ##s , the total of which were the count of objects being transferred . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to avoid breaking open the containers for the count , marks were placed on the outside of the containers . [SEP]
[CLS] these physical marks , in other words , acted as material abstraction ##s of a material ##ly abstract process of accounting , using conceptual abstraction ##s ( numbers ) to communicate its meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] abstract things are sometimes defined as those things that do not exist in reality or exist only as sensory experiences , like the color red . [SEP]
[CLS] abstraction ##s sometimes have ambiguous refer ##ents ; for example , " happiness " ( when used as an abstraction ) can refer to as many things as there are people and events or states of being which make them happy . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , " architecture " refers not only to the design of safe , functional buildings , but also to elements of creation and innovation which aim at elegant solutions to construction problems , to the use of space , and to the attempt to ev ##oke an emotional response in the builders , owners , viewers and users of the building . [SEP]
[CLS] abstraction uses a strategy of sim ##pl ##ification , wherein formerly concrete details are left ambiguous , vague , or und ##efined ; thus effective communication about things in the abstract requires an intuitive or common experience between the com ##mun ##ica ##tor and the communication recipient . [SEP]
[CLS] specifically , the conceptual diagram " graph 1 " identifies only three boxes , two el ##lip ##ses , and four arrows ( and their five labels ) , whereas the " picture 1 " shows much more pictorial detail , with the scores of implied relationships as implicit in the picture rather than with the nine explicit details in the graph . [SEP]
[CLS] an abstraction can thus en ##cap ##sul ##ate each of these levels of detail with no loss of general ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] in philosophical terminology , " abstraction " is the thought process wherein ideas are distance ##d from objects . [SEP]
[CLS] strictly speaking , it refers to art un ##con ##cer ##ned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world — it can , however , refer to an object or image which has been di ##sti ##lled from the real world , or indeed , another work of art . [SEP]
[CLS] artwork that res ##ha ##pes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract ; that which derives from , but does not im ##itate a recognizable subject is called non ##ob ##ject ##ive abstraction . [SEP]
[CLS] later still , abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms , such as color , freedom from objective context , and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs . [SEP]
[CLS] computer scientists use abstraction to make models that can be used and re - used without having to re - write all the program code for each new application on every different type of computer . [SEP]
[CLS] they communicate their solutions with the computer by writing source code in some particular computer language which can be translated into machine code for different types of computers to execute . [SEP]
[CLS] this means that the program code can be written so that code doesn ' t have to depend on the specific details of supporting applications , operating system software , or hardware , but on a cat ##egorical concept of the solution . [SEP]
[CLS] a solution to the problem can then be integrated into the system framework with minimal additional work . [SEP]
[CLS] abstraction ##s and levels of abstraction play an important role in the theory of general semantics originated by alfred ko ##rzy ##bs ##ki . [SEP]
[CLS] ana ##to ##l rap ##op ##ort wrote : " abstract ##ing is a mechanism by which an infinite variety of experiences can be mapped on short noises ( words ) . " [SEP]
[CLS] francis fu ##ku ##yama defines history as " a deliberate attempt of abstraction in which we separate out important from un ##im ##port ##ant events " . [SEP]
[CLS] researchers in linguistics frequently apply abstraction so as to allow analysis of the phenomena of language at the desired level of detail . [SEP]
[CLS] a commonly used abstraction , the " phone ##me " , abstracts speech sounds in such a way as to neglect details that cannot serve to differentiate meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] other analogous kinds of abstraction ##s ( sometimes called " emi ##c units " ) considered by linguist ##s include mor ##ph ##eme ##s , graph ##eme ##s , and lex ##eme ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] pr ##ag ##matic ##s involves considerations that make reference to the user of the language ; semantics considers expressions and what they denote ( the design ##ata ) abstract ##ed from the language user ; and syntax considers only the expressions themselves , abstract ##ed from the design ##ata . [SEP]
[CLS] abstraction in mathematics is the process of extract ##ing the underlying essence of a mathematical concept , removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected , and general ##izing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena . [SEP]
[CLS] the main disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts are more difficult to learn , and require a degree of mathematical maturity and experience before they can be ass ##imi ##lated . [SEP]
[CLS] in music , the term " abstraction " can be used to describe imp ##rov ##isa ##tory approaches to interpretation , and may sometimes indicate abandonment of ton ##ality . [SEP]
[CLS] at ##onal music has no key signature , and is characterized by the exploration of internal nu ##meric relationships . [SEP]
[CLS] abstraction in philosophy is the process ( or , to some , the alleged process ) in concept formation of recognizing some set of common features in individuals , and on that basis forming a concept of that feature . [SEP]
[CLS] ' so words are used to stand as outward marks of our internal ideas , which are taken from particular things ; but if every particular idea that we take in had its own special name , there would be no end to names . [SEP]
[CLS] to prevent this , the mind makes particular ideas received from particular things become general ; which it does by considering them as they are in the mind — mental appearances — separate from all other existence ##s , and from the circumstances of real existence , such as time , place , and so on . [SEP]
[CLS] in it , an idea taken from a particular thing becomes a general representative of all of the same kind , and its name becomes a general name that is applicable to any existing thing that fits that abstract idea . ' [SEP]
[CLS] i put abstract feelings on the same level as abstract thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] in social theory , abstraction is used as both an idea ##tion ##al and material process . [SEP]
[CLS] he used the example of commodity abstraction to show that abstraction occurs in practice as people create systems of abstract exchange that extend beyond the immediate physical ##ity of the object and yet have real and immediate consequences . [SEP]
[CLS] two books that have taken this theme of the abstraction of social relations as an organizing process in human history are ( 1996 ) and the second volume of towards a theory of abstract community , published in 2006 : these books argue that the nation is an abstract community bringing together strangers who will never meet as such ; thus con ##stituting material ##ly real and substantial , but abstract ##ed and mediated relations . [SEP]
[CLS] the books suggest that contemporary processes of globalization and media ##ti ##zation have contributed to material ##ly abstract ##ing relations between people , with major consequences for how we live our lives . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , we could talk about homo cyber sap ##iens ( the man who can extend his biological ##ly determined intelligence thanks to new technologies ) , or homo cr ##ea ##tiv ##us ( who is simply creative ) . [SEP]
[CLS] breaking away from directly experienced reality was a common trend in 19th century sciences ( especially physics ) , and this was the effort which was fundamentally determined the way economics tried and still tries to approach the economic aspects of social life . [SEP]
[CLS] it is abstraction we meet in the case of both newton ’ s physics and the neoclassical theory , since the goal was to grasp the un ##chang ##ea ##ble and timeless essence of phenomena . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , newton created the concept of the material point by following the abstraction method so that he abstract ##ed from the dimension and shape of any per ##ce ##pt ##ible object , preserving only in ##ert ##ial and translation ##al motion . [SEP]
[CLS] neoclassical economists created the indefinitely abstract notion of homo economic ##us by following the same procedure . [SEP]
[CLS] economists abstract from all individual and personal qualities in order to get to those characteristics that em ##body the essence of economic activity . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , it is the substance of the economic man that they try to grasp . [SEP]
[CLS] any characteristic beyond it only disturb ##s the functioning of this essential core . [SEP]
