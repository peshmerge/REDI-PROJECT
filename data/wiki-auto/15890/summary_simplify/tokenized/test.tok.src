[CLS] he is considered a literary icon ##oc ##las ##t and , alongside william s . burroughs and allen gin ##sberg , a pioneer of the beat generation . [SEP]
[CLS] he became an underground celebrity and , with other beats , a pro ##gen ##itor of the hip ##pie movement , although he remained antagonist ##ic toward some of its politically radical elements . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1969 , at age 47 , ke ##rou ##ac died from an abdominal hem ##or ##rh ##age caused by a lifetime of heavy drinking . [SEP]
[CLS] there is some confusion surrounding his name , partly because of variations on the spelling of ke ##rou ##ac , and because of ke ##rou ##ac ' s own statement of his name as jean - louis le ##bri ##s de ke ##rou ##ac . [SEP]
[CLS] his reason for that statement seems to be linked to an old family legend that the ke ##rou ##ac ##s had descended from baron francois louis alexandre le ##bri ##s de ke ##rou ##ac . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac ' s baptism certificate lists his name simply as jean louis ki ##rou ##ac , the most common spelling of the name in quebec . [SEP]
[CLS] research has shown that ke ##rou ##ac ' s roots were indeed in brittany , and he was descended from a middle - class merchant colon ##ist , ur ##bain - francois le bi ##han , si ##eur de ke ##r ##vo ##ac , whose sons married french canadians . [SEP]
[CLS] in one interview he claimed it was from the name of the cornish language ( " kern ##ew ##ek " ) and that the ke ##rou ##ac ##s had fled from cornwall to brittany . [SEP]
[CLS] another version was that the ke ##rou ##ac ##s had come to cornwall from ireland before the time of christ and the name meant " language of the house " . [SEP]
[CLS] in still another interview he said it was an irish word for " language of the water " and related to " ke ##r ##wick " . [SEP]
[CLS] the ke ##rou ##ac family was living there in 1926 when jack ' s older brother gerard died of r ##he ##umatic fever , aged nine . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac was referred to as ti jean or little john around the house during his childhood . [SEP]
[CLS] some of ke ##rou ##ac ' s poetry was written in french , and in letters written to friend allen gin ##sberg towards the end of his life , he expressed a desire to speak his parents ' native tongue again . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2016 , a whole volume of previously unpublished works originally written in french by ke ##rou ##ac was published as " la vie est d ' ho ##mma ##ge " . [SEP]
[CLS] for pena ##nce , he was told to say a rosary , during which he heard god tell him that he had a good soul , that he would suffer in life and die in pain and horror , but would in the end receive salvation . [SEP]
[CLS] this experience , along with his dying brother ' s vision of the virgin mary ( as the nuns fa ##wn ##ed over him , convinced he was a saint ) , combined with a later study of buddhism and an ongoing commitment to christ , solid ##ified the world ##view which would inform ke ##rou ##ac ' s work . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac once told ted be ##rrigan , in an interview for " the paris review " , of an incident in the 1940s in which his mother and father were walking together in a jewish neighborhood on the lower east side of new york . [SEP]
[CLS] he recalled " a whole bunch of rabbis walking arm in arm . . . tee ##dah - tee ##dah – tee ##dah . . . and they wouldn ' t part for this christian man and his wife , so my father went po ##om ! [SEP]
[CLS] leo , after the death of his child , also treated a priest with similar contempt , angrily throwing him out of the house despite his invitation from gabrielle . [SEP]
[CLS] he entered columbia university after spending a year at horace mann school , where he earned the re ##quisite grades for entry to columbia . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac broke a leg playing football during his freshman season , and during an abbreviated second year he argued constantly with coach lou little , who kept him bench ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] while at columbia , ke ##rou ##ac wrote several sports articles for the student newspaper , the " columbia daily spectator " , and joined the phi gamma delta fraternity . [SEP]
[CLS] when his football career at columbia ended , ke ##rou ##ac dropped out of the university . [SEP]
[CLS] he continued to live for a time in new york ' s upper west side with his girlfriend and future first wife , ed ##ie parker . [SEP]
[CLS] it was during this time that he met the beat generation people — now famous — with whom he would always be associated , and who as characters formed the basis of many of his novels , including allen gin ##sberg , neal cass ##ady , john cl ##ello ##n holmes , herbert hu ##nc ##ke , lucien carr and william s . burroughs . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac joined the united states merchant marine in 1942 and in 1943 joined the united states navy , but served only eight days of active duty before arriving on the sick list . [SEP]
[CLS] according to his medical report , ke ##rou ##ac said he " asked for an as ##pi ##rin for his headache ##s and they diagnosed me dementia pr ##ae ##co ##x and sent me here . " [SEP]
[CLS] the medical examiner reported that ke ##rou ##ac ' s military adjustment was poor , quoting ke ##rou ##ac : " i just can ' t stand it ; i like to be by myself . " [SEP]
[CLS] while serving in the united states merchant marine , ke ##rou ##ac wrote his first novel " the sea is my brother " . [SEP]
[CLS] although written in 1942 , the book was not published until 2011 , some 42 years after ke ##rou ##ac ' s death and 70 years after it was written . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac described the work as being about " man ' s simple revolt from society as it is , with the in ##e ##qual ##ities , frustration , and self - inflicted ago ##nies . " [SEP]
[CLS] he viewed the work as a failure , calling it a " cr ##ock as literature " , and he never actively sought to publish it . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1944 , ke ##rou ##ac was arrested as a material witness in the murder of david kam ##mere ##r , who had been stalking ke ##rou ##ac ' s friend lucien carr since carr was a teenager in st . louis . [SEP]
[CLS] according to carr , kam ##mere ##r ' s homosexual obsession turned aggressive , finally pro ##voking carr to stab him to death in self - defense . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac and burroughs collaborated on a novel about the kam ##mere ##r killing entitled " and the hip ##po ##s were boiled in their tanks " . [SEP]
[CLS] though the book was not published during their lifetime ##s , an excerpt eventually appeared in " word virus : the william s . burroughs reader " ( and as noted below , the novel was finally published late 2008 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] later , ke ##rou ##ac lived with his parents in the ozone park neighborhood of queens , after they had also moved to new york . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote his first published novel , " the town and the city " , and began the famous " on the road " around 1949 when living there . [SEP]
[CLS] " the town and the city " was published in 1950 under the name " john ke ##rou ##ac " and , though it earned him a few respectable reviews , the book sold poorly . [SEP]
[CLS] heavily influenced by ke ##rou ##ac ' s reading of thomas wolfe , it reflects on the generation ##al epic formula and the contrasts of small town life versus the multi - dimensional , and larger life of the city . [SEP]
[CLS] building upon previous drafts tentatively titled " the beat generation " and " gone on the road , " ke ##rou ##ac completed what is now known as " on the road " in april 1951 , while living at 45 ##4 west 20th street in manhattan with his second wife , joan have ##rt ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] the book was largely autobiographical and describes ke ##rou ##ac ' s road - trip adventures across the united states and mexico with neal cass ##ady in the late 40 ##s and early 50 ##s , as well as his relationships with other beat writers and friends . [SEP]
[CLS] before beginning , ke ##rou ##ac cut sheets of tracing paper into long strips , wide enough for a type ##writer , and taped them together into a 120 ft long roll which he then fed into the machine . [SEP]
[CLS] the resulting manuscript contained no chapter or paragraph breaks and was much more explicit than the version which would eventually be published . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , according to his columbia professor and mentor mark van do ##ren , he had outlined much of the work in his journals over the several preceding years . [SEP]
[CLS] before " on the road " was accepted by viking press , ke ##rou ##ac got a job as a " railroad brake ##man and fire lookout " ( see des ##ola ##tion peak ( washington ) ) traveling between the east and west coasts of the united states to earn money , frequently finding rest and the quiet space necessary for writing at the home of his mother . [SEP]
[CLS] while employed in this way he met and befriended abe green , a young freight train jumper who later introduced ke ##rou ##ac to herbert hu ##nc ##ke , a times square street hu ##stle ##r and favorite of many beat generation writers . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period of travel , ke ##rou ##ac wrote what he considered to be " his life ' s work " : " vanity of du ##lu ##oz " . [SEP]
[CLS] between 1955 - 1956 , he lived on and off with his sister , whom he called " ni ##n , " and her husband , paul blake , at their home outside of rocky mount , n . c . ( " testament , va . " in his works ) where he med ##itated on , and studied , buddhism . [SEP]
[CLS] many editors were also uncomfortable with the idea of publishing a book that contained what were , for the era , graphic descriptions of drug use and homosexual behavior — a move that could result in ob ##sc ##enity charges being filed , a fate that later be ##fell burroughs ' " naked lunch " and gin ##sberg ' s " howl " . [SEP]
[CLS] and once he has found him , the god ##hood of god is forever established and really must not be spoken about . " [SEP]
[CLS] according to his biographer , historian douglas brink ##ley , " on the road " has been mis ##int ##er ##pre ##ted as a tale of companions out looking for kicks , but the most important thing to comprehend is that ke ##rou ##ac was an american catholic author – for example , virtually every page of his diary bore a sketch of a cr ##uc ##if ##ix , a prayer , or an appeal to christ to be forgiven . [SEP]
[CLS] in the spring of 1951 , while pregnant , joan have ##rt ##y left and divorced ke ##rou ##ac . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 1952 , she gave birth to ke ##rou ##ac ' s only child , jan ke ##rou ##ac , though he refused to acknowledge her as his daughter until a blood test confirmed it 9 years later . [SEP]
[CLS] for the next several years ke ##rou ##ac continued writing and traveling , taking long trips through the u . s . and mexico . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period , he finished drafts of what would become ten more novels , including " the subterranean ##s " , " doctor sax " , " tri ##ste ##ssa " , and " des ##ola ##tion angels " , which chronicle many of the events of these years . [SEP]
[CLS] at the request of his editors , ke ##rou ##ac changed the setting of the novel from new york to san francisco . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac found enemies on both sides of the political spectrum , the right disdain ##ing his association with drugs and sexual li ##bert ##ini ##sm and the left contempt ##uous of his anti - communism and catholicism ; characteristic ##ally , he watched the 1954 senate mccarthy hearings smoking marijuana and root ##ing for the anti - communist crusader , senator joseph mccarthy . [SEP]
[CLS] in " des ##ola ##tion angels " he wrote , " when i went to columbia all they tried to teach us was marx , as if i cared " ( considering marxism , like freud ##iani ##sm , to be an ill ##uso ##ry tangent ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1957 , after being rejected by several other publishers , " on the road " was finally purchased by viking press , which demanded major revisions prior to publication . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the more sexually explicit passages were removed and , fearing libel suits , pseudonym ##s were used for the book ' s " characters . " [SEP]
[CLS] in july 1957 , ke ##rou ##ac moved to a small house at 141 ##8 ##1 ##⁄ ##2 cl ##ouse ##r avenue in the college park section of orlando , florida , to await the release of " on the road " . [SEP]
[CLS] weeks later , a review of the book by gilbert mills ##tein appeared in " the new york times " pro ##claiming ke ##rou ##ac the voice of a new generation . [SEP]
[CLS] the term beat generation was invented by ke ##rou ##ac during a conversation held with fellow novelist herbert hu ##nc ##ke . [SEP]
[CLS] hu ##nc ##ke used the term " beat " to describe a person with little money and few prospects . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac ' s novel is often described as the defining work of the post - world war ii beat generation and ke ##rou ##ac came to be called " the king of the beat generation , " a term with which he never felt comfortable . [SEP]
[CLS] neal cass ##ady , possibly as a result of his new notoriety as the central character of the book , was set up and arrested for selling marijuana . [SEP]
[CLS] in response , ke ##rou ##ac chronicle ##d parts of his own experience with buddhism , as well as some of his adventures with gary snyder and other san francisco - area poets , in " the dharma bum ##s " , set in california and washington and published in 1958 . [SEP]
[CLS] to begin writing " dharma bum ##s " , ke ##rou ##ac typed onto a ten - foot length of tel ##ep ##rin ##ter paper , to avoid interrupting his flow for paper changes , as he had done six years previously for " on the road " . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac was demo ##ral ##ized by criticism of " dharma bum ##s " from such respected figures in the american field of buddhism as zen teachers ruth fuller sas ##aki and alan watts . [SEP]
[CLS] he passed up the opportunity to reunite with snyder in california , and explained to philip whale ##n " i ' d be ashamed to confront you and gary now i ' ve become so decade ##nt and drunk and don ' t give a shit . [SEP]
[CLS] in further reaction to their criticism , he quoted part of abe green ' s cafe rec ##itation , " th ##ras ##onic ##al ya ##wn ##ing in the aba ##tto ##ir of the soul " : " a gaping , ra ##bid congregation , eager to bath ##e , are washed over by the font of eu ##ph ##oria , and bas ##k like proto ##zo ##ans in the celebrated light . " [SEP]
[CLS] the television series " route 66 " ( 1960 – 1964 ) , featuring two un ##tet ##hered young men " on the road " in a corvette seeking adventure and fuel ##ing their travels by apparently pl ##ent ##iful temporary jobs in the various u . s . local ##es framing the anthology - styled stories , gave the impression of being a commercially san ##iti ##zed mis ##app ##ropriation of ke ##rou ##ac ' s story model for " on the road " . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac felt he ' d been conspicuous ##ly ripped off by " route 66 " creator stirling si ##lli ##pha ##nt and sought to sue him , cbs , the screen gems tv production company , and sponsor chevrolet , but was somehow counsel ##ed against proceeding with what looked like a very potent cause of action . [SEP]
[CLS] john anton ##elli ' s 1985 documentary " ke ##rou ##ac , the movie " begins and ends with footage of ke ##rou ##ac reading from " on the road " and " visions of cody " on " the steve allen plymouth show " in november 1959 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1965 , he met the poet you ##en ##n g ##wer ##nig who was a breton american like him in new york , and they became friends . [SEP]
[CLS] g ##wer ##nig used to translate his breton language poems in english in order to make ke ##rou ##ac read and understand them : " meeting with jack ke ##rou ##ac in 1965 , for instance , was a decisive turn . [SEP]
[CLS] since he could not speak breton he asked me : ' would you not write some of your poems in english ? [SEP]
[CLS] in the following years , ke ##rou ##ac suffered the loss of his older sister to a heart attack in 1964 and his mother suffered a para ##ly ##zing stroke in 1966 . [SEP]

[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac talked about the counter ##culture of the 1960s in what would be his last appearance on television . [SEP]
[CLS] at eleven o ' clock , on the morning of october 20 , 1969 , in st . petersburg , florida , ke ##rou ##ac was sitting in his favorite chair drinking whiskey and mal ##t liquor , working on a book about his father ' s print shop in lowell , massachusetts . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac was taken to a nearby hospital , suffering from an es ##op ##ha ##ge ##al hem ##or ##rh ##age . [SEP]
[CLS] he received several trans ##fusion ##s in an attempt to make up for the loss of blood , and doctors subsequently attempted surgery , but a damaged liver prevented his blood from cl ##otti ##ng . [SEP]
[CLS] his cause of death was listed as an internal hem ##or ##rh ##age ( bleeding es ##op ##ha ##ge ##al var ##ices ) caused by ci ##rr ##hosis , the result of longtime alcohol abuse . [SEP]
[CLS] a possible contributing factor was an un ##tre ##ated her ##nia he suffered in a bar fight several weeks earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] he was honored posthumously with a doctor of letters degree from his hometown university of massachusetts lowell on june 2 , 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] later , ke ##rou ##ac included ideas he developed from his buddhist studies that began with gary snyder . [SEP]
[CLS] although ke ##rou ##ac ' s prose was spontaneous and purported ##ly without edit ##s , he primarily wrote autobiographical novels ( or " roman a cl ##ef " ) based upon actual events from his life and the people with whom he interact ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] the central features of this writing method were the ideas of breath ( borrowed from jazz and from buddhist meditation breathing ) , imp ##rov ##ising words over the inherent structures of mind and language , and limited revision . [SEP]
[CLS] when spoken , the words take on a certain musical rhythm and tempo . [SEP]
[CLS] " the dharma bum ##s " contains accounts of a mountain climbing trip ke ##rou ##ac took with snyder , and includes excerpts of letters from snyder . [SEP]
[CLS] that summer , ke ##rou ##ac took a job as a fire lookout on des ##ola ##tion peak in the north cascade ##s in washington , after hearing snyder ' s and whale ##n ' s stories of working as fire spot ##ters . [SEP]
[CLS] allen gin ##sberg , initially un ##im ##pressed , would later be one of his great proponents , and it was ke ##rou ##ac ' s free - flowing prose method that inspired the composition of gin ##sberg ' s poem " howl " . [SEP]
[CLS] it was at about the time of " the subterranean ##s " that he was encouraged by gin ##sberg and others to formally explain his style . [SEP]
[CLS] of his exposition ##s of the spontaneous prose method , the most con ##cise was " belief and technique for modern prose " , a list of 30 " essential ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] although the body of ke ##rou ##ac ' s work has been published in english , recent research has shown that , in addition to his poetry and letters to friends and family , he also wrote unpublished works of fiction in french . [SEP]
[CLS] all these works , including " la nu ##it est ma femme " , " sur le che ##min " , and large sections of " maggie cassidy " ( originally written in french ) , have now been published together in a volume entitled " la vie est d ' ho ##mma ##ge " ( bore ##al , 2016 ) edited by university of pennsylvania professor jean - christophe cl ##out ##ier . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1996 , the " nouvelle revue francaise " published excerpts and an article on " la nu ##it est ma femme " , and scholar paul ma ##her jr . , in his biography " ke ##rou ##ac : his life and work ' , " discussed sur le che ##min ' s plot and characters . [SEP]
[CLS] the novella , completed in five days in mexico during december 1952 , is a telling example of ke ##rou ##ac ' s attempts at writing in his first language , a language he often called can ##uck french . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac refers to this short novel in a letter addressed to neal cass ##ady ( who is commonly known as the inspiration for the character dean mori ##arty ) dated january 10 , 1953 . [SEP]
[CLS] the published novel runs over 110 pages , having been rec ##ons ##tituted from six distinct files in the ke ##rou ##ac archive by professor cl ##out ##ier . [SEP]
[CLS] set in 1935 , mostly on the east coast , it explores some of the recurring themes of ke ##rou ##ac ' s literature by way of a spoken word narrative . [SEP]
[CLS] even though this work has the same title as one of his best known english novels , it is the original french version of an incomplete translation that would later become " old bull in the bow ##ery " ( now published in " the unknown ke ##rou ##ac " from the library of america ) . [SEP]
[CLS] " the unknown ke ##rou ##ac , " edited by todd tie ##tch ##en , includes cl ##out ##ier ' s translation of " la nu ##it est ma femme " and the completed translation of " sur le che ##min " under the title " old bull in the bow ##ery " . [SEP]
[CLS] " la nu ##it est ma femme " was written in early 1951 and completed a few days or weeks before he began the original english version of " on the road " , as many scholars , such as paul ma ##her jr . , joyce johnson , hassan mel ##eh ##y , and yan ##nis liv ##ada ##s have pointed out . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##rou ##ac ' s early writing , particularly his first novel " the town and the city " , was more conventional , and bore the strong influence of thomas wolfe . [SEP]
[CLS] the technique ke ##rou ##ac developed that later made him famous was heavily influenced by jazz , especially be ##bo ##p , and later , buddhism , as well as the famous joan anderson letter written by neal cass ##ady . [SEP]
