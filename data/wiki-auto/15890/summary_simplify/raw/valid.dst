He is considered a literary iconoclast and, alongside William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, a pioneer of the Beat Generation.
He became an underground celebrity and, with other beats, a progenitor of the hippie movement, although he remained antagonistic toward some of its politically radical elements.
In 1969, at age 47, Kerouac died from an abdominal hemorrhage caused by a lifetime of heavy drinking.
There is some confusion surrounding his name, partly because of variations on the spelling of Kerouac, and because of Kerouac's own statement of his name as Jean-Louis Lebris de Kerouac.
His reason for that statement seems to be linked to an old family legend that the Kerouacs had descended from Baron François Louis Alexandre Lebris de Kerouac.
Kerouac's baptism certificate lists his name simply as Jean Louis Kirouac, the most common spelling of the name in Quebec.
Research has shown that Kerouac's roots were indeed in Brittany, and he was descended from a middle-class merchant colonist, Urbain-François Le Bihan, Sieur de Kervoac, whose sons married French Canadians.
In one interview he claimed it was from the name of the Cornish language ("Kernewek") and that the Kerouacs had fled from Cornwall to Brittany.
Another version was that the Kerouacs had come to Cornwall from Ireland before the time of Christ and the name meant "language of the house".
In still another interview he said it was an Irish word for "language of the water" and related to "Kerwick".
The Kerouac family was living there in 1926 when Jack's older brother Gerard died of rheumatic fever, aged nine.
Kerouac was referred to as Ti Jean or little John around the house during his childhood.
Some of Kerouac's poetry was written in French, and in letters written to friend Allen Ginsberg towards the end of his life, he expressed a desire to speak his parents' native tongue again.
In 2016, a whole volume of previously unpublished works originally written in French by Kerouac was published as "La vie est d'hommage".
For penance, he was told to say a rosary, during which he heard God tell him that he had a good soul, that he would suffer in life and die in pain and horror, but would in the end receive salvation.
This experience, along with his dying brother's vision of the Virgin Mary (as the nuns fawned over him, convinced he was a saint), combined with a later study of Buddhism and an ongoing commitment to Christ, solidified the worldview which would inform Kerouac's work.
Kerouac once told Ted Berrigan, in an interview for "The Paris Review", of an incident in the 1940s in which his mother and father were walking together in a Jewish neighborhood on the Lower East Side of New York.
He recalled "a whole bunch of rabbis walking arm in arm ... teedah- teedah – teedah ... and they wouldn't part for this Christian man and his wife, so my father went POOM!
Leo, after the death of his child, also treated a priest with similar contempt, angrily throwing him out of the house despite his invitation from Gabrielle.
He entered Columbia University after spending a year at Horace Mann School, where he earned the requisite grades for entry to Columbia.
Kerouac broke a leg playing football during his freshman season, and during an abbreviated second year he argued constantly with coach Lou Little, who kept him benched.
While at Columbia, Kerouac wrote several sports articles for the student newspaper, the "Columbia Daily Spectator", and joined the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.
When his football career at Columbia ended, Kerouac dropped out of the university.
He continued to live for a time in New York's Upper West Side with his girlfriend and future first wife, Edie Parker.
It was during this time that he met the Beat Generation people—now famous—with whom he would always be associated, and who as characters formed the basis of many of his novels, including Allen Ginsberg, Neal Cassady, John Clellon Holmes, Herbert Huncke, Lucien Carr and William S. Burroughs.
Kerouac joined the United States Merchant Marine in 1942 and in 1943 joined the United States Navy, but served only eight days of active duty before arriving on the sick list.
According to his medical report, Kerouac said he "asked for an aspirin for his headaches and they diagnosed me dementia praecox and sent me here."
The medical examiner reported that Kerouac's military adjustment was poor, quoting Kerouac: "I just can't stand it; I like to be by myself."
While serving in the United States Merchant Marine, Kerouac wrote his first novel "The Sea Is My Brother".
Although written in 1942, the book was not published until 2011, some 42 years after Kerouac's death and 70 years after it was written.
Kerouac described the work as being about "man's simple revolt from society as it is, with the inequalities, frustration, and self-inflicted agonies."
He viewed the work as a failure, calling it a "crock as literature", and he never actively sought to publish it.
In 1944, Kerouac was arrested as a material witness in the murder of David Kammerer, who had been stalking Kerouac's friend Lucien Carr since Carr was a teenager in St. Louis.
According to Carr, Kammerer's homosexual obsession turned aggressive, finally provoking Carr to stab him to death in self-defense.
Kerouac and Burroughs collaborated on a novel about the Kammerer killing entitled "And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks".
Though the book was not published during their lifetimes, an excerpt eventually appeared in "Word Virus: The William S. Burroughs Reader" (and as noted below, the novel was finally published late 2008).
Later, Kerouac lived with his parents in the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens, after they had also moved to New York.
He wrote his first published novel, "The Town and the City", and began the famous "On the Road" around 1949 when living there.
"The Town and the City" was published in 1950 under the name "John Kerouac" and, though it earned him a few respectable reviews, the book sold poorly.
Heavily influenced by Kerouac's reading of Thomas Wolfe, it reflects on the generational epic formula and the contrasts of small town life versus the multi-dimensional, and larger life of the city.
Building upon previous drafts tentatively titled "The Beat Generation" and "Gone on the Road," Kerouac completed what is now known as "On the Road" in April 1951, while living at 454 West 20th Street in Manhattan with his second wife, Joan Haverty.
The book was largely autobiographical and describes Kerouac's road-trip adventures across the United States and Mexico with Neal Cassady in the late 40s and early 50s, as well as his relationships with other Beat writers and friends.
Before beginning, Kerouac cut sheets of tracing paper into long strips, wide enough for a typewriter, and taped them together into a 120 ft long roll which he then fed into the machine.
The resulting manuscript contained no chapter or paragraph breaks and was much more explicit than the version which would eventually be published.
In fact, according to his Columbia professor and mentor Mark Van Doren, he had outlined much of the work in his journals over the several preceding years.
Before "On the Road" was accepted by Viking Press, Kerouac got a job as a "railroad brakeman and fire lookout" (see Desolation Peak (Washington)) traveling between the East and West coasts of the United States to earn money, frequently finding rest and the quiet space necessary for writing at the home of his mother.
While employed in this way he met and befriended Abe Green, a young freight train jumper who later introduced Kerouac to Herbert Huncke, a Times Square street hustler and favorite of many Beat Generation writers.
During this period of travel, Kerouac wrote what he considered to be "his life's work": "Vanity of Duluoz".
Between 1955-1956, he lived on and off with his sister, whom he called "Nin," and her husband, Paul Blake, at their home outside of Rocky Mount, N.C. ("Testament, Va." in his works) where he meditated on, and studied, Buddhism.
Many editors were also uncomfortable with the idea of publishing a book that contained what were, for the era, graphic descriptions of drug use and homosexual behavior—a move that could result in obscenity charges being filed, a fate that later befell Burroughs' "Naked Lunch" and Ginsberg's "Howl".
And once he has found Him, the Godhood of God is forever Established and really must not be spoken about."
According to his biographer, historian Douglas Brinkley, "On the Road" has been misinterpreted as a tale of companions out looking for kicks, but the most important thing to comprehend is that Kerouac was an American Catholic author – for example, virtually every page of his diary bore a sketch of a crucifix, a prayer, or an appeal to Christ to be forgiven.
In the spring of 1951, while pregnant, Joan Haverty left and divorced Kerouac.
In February 1952, she gave birth to Kerouac's only child, Jan Kerouac, though he refused to acknowledge her as his daughter until a blood test confirmed it 9 years later.
For the next several years Kerouac continued writing and traveling, taking long trips through the U.S. and Mexico.
During this period, he finished drafts of what would become ten more novels, including "The Subterraneans", "Doctor Sax", "Tristessa", and "Desolation Angels", which chronicle many of the events of these years.
At the request of his editors, Kerouac changed the setting of the novel from New York to San Francisco.
Kerouac found enemies on both sides of the political spectrum, the right disdaining his association with drugs and sexual libertinism and the left contemptuous of his anti-communism and Catholicism; characteristically, he watched the 1954 Senate McCarthy hearings smoking marijuana and rooting for the anti-communist crusader, Senator Joseph McCarthy.
In "Desolation Angels" he wrote, "when I went to Columbia all they tried to teach us was Marx, as if I cared" (considering Marxism, like Freudianism, to be an illusory tangent).
In 1957, after being rejected by several other publishers, "On the Road" was finally purchased by Viking Press, which demanded major revisions prior to publication.
Many of the more sexually explicit passages were removed and, fearing libel suits, pseudonyms were used for the book's "characters."
In July 1957, Kerouac moved to a small house at 14181⁄2 Clouser Avenue in the College Park section of Orlando, Florida, to await the release of "On the Road".
Weeks later, a review of the book by Gilbert Millstein appeared in "The New York Times" proclaiming Kerouac the voice of a new generation.
The term Beat Generation was invented by Kerouac during a conversation held with fellow novelist Herbert Huncke.
Huncke used the term "beat" to describe a person with little money and few prospects.
Kerouac's novel is often described as the defining work of the post-World War II Beat Generation and Kerouac came to be called "the king of the beat generation," a term with which he never felt comfortable.
Neal Cassady, possibly as a result of his new notoriety as the central character of the book, was set up and arrested for selling marijuana.
In response, Kerouac chronicled parts of his own experience with Buddhism, as well as some of his adventures with Gary Snyder and other San Francisco-area poets, in "The Dharma Bums", set in California and Washington and published in 1958.
To begin writing "Dharma Bums", Kerouac typed onto a ten-foot length of teleprinter paper, to avoid interrupting his flow for paper changes, as he had done six years previously for "On the Road".
Kerouac was demoralized by criticism of "Dharma Bums" from such respected figures in the American field of Buddhism as Zen teachers Ruth Fuller Sasaki and Alan Watts.
He passed up the opportunity to reunite with Snyder in California, and explained to Philip Whalen "I'd be ashamed to confront you and Gary now I've become so decadent and drunk and don't give a shit.
In further reaction to their criticism, he quoted part of Abe Green's café recitation, "Thrasonical Yawning in the Abattoir of the Soul": "A gaping, rabid congregation, eager to bathe, are washed over by the Font of Euphoria, and bask like protozoans in the celebrated light."
The television series "Route 66" (1960–1964), featuring two untethered young men "on the road" in a Corvette seeking adventure and fueling their travels by apparently plentiful temporary jobs in the various U.S. locales framing the anthology-styled stories, gave the impression of being a commercially sanitized misappropriation of Kerouac's story model for "On the Road".
Kerouac felt he'd been conspicuously ripped off by "Route 66" creator Stirling Silliphant and sought to sue him, CBS, the Screen Gems TV production company, and sponsor Chevrolet, but was somehow counseled against proceeding with what looked like a very potent cause of action.
John Antonelli's 1985 documentary "Kerouac, the Movie" begins and ends with footage of Kerouac reading from "On the Road" and "Visions of Cody" on "The Steve Allen Plymouth Show" in November 1959.
In 1965, he met the poet Youenn Gwernig who was a Breton American like him in New York, and they became friends.
Gwernig used to translate his Breton language poems in English in order to make Kerouac read and understand them : "Meeting with Jack Kerouac in 1965, for instance, was a decisive turn.
Since he could not speak Breton he asked me : 'Would you not write some of your poems in English?
In the following years, Kerouac suffered the loss of his older sister to a heart attack in 1964 and his mother suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1966.
Also in 1968, he appeared on the television show "Firing Line" produced and hosted by William F. Buckley Jr. (a friend of Kerouac's from his college years).
Kerouac talked about the counterculture of the 1960s in what would be his last appearance on television.
At eleven o'clock, on the morning of October 20, 1969, in St. Petersburg, Florida, Kerouac was sitting in his favorite chair drinking whiskey and malt liquor, working on a book about his father's print shop in Lowell, Massachusetts.
Kerouac was taken to a nearby hospital, suffering from an esophageal hemorrhage.
He received several transfusions in an attempt to make up for the loss of blood, and doctors subsequently attempted surgery, but a damaged liver prevented his blood from clotting.
His cause of death was listed as an internal hemorrhage (bleeding esophageal varices) caused by cirrhosis, the result of longtime alcohol abuse.
A possible contributing factor was an untreated hernia he suffered in a bar fight several weeks earlier.
He was honored posthumously with a Doctor of Letters degree from his hometown University of Massachusetts Lowell on June 2, 2007.
Later, Kerouac included ideas he developed from his Buddhist studies that began with Gary Snyder.
Although Kerouac's prose was spontaneous and purportedly without edits, he primarily wrote autobiographical novels (or "roman à clef") based upon actual events from his life and the people with whom he interacted.
The central features of this writing method were the ideas of breath (borrowed from jazz and from Buddhist meditation breathing), improvising words over the inherent structures of mind and language, and limited revision.
When spoken, the words take on a certain musical rhythm and tempo.
"The Dharma Bums" contains accounts of a mountain climbing trip Kerouac took with Snyder, and includes excerpts of letters from Snyder.
That summer, Kerouac took a job as a fire lookout on Desolation Peak in the North Cascades in Washington, after hearing Snyder's and Whalen's stories of working as fire spotters.
Allen Ginsberg, initially unimpressed, would later be one of his great proponents, and it was Kerouac's free-flowing prose method that inspired the composition of Ginsberg's poem "Howl".
It was at about the time of "The Subterraneans" that he was encouraged by Ginsberg and others to formally explain his style.
Of his expositions of the Spontaneous Prose method, the most concise was "Belief and Technique for Modern Prose", a list of 30 "essentials".
Although the body of Kerouac's work has been published in English, recent research has shown that, in addition to his poetry and letters to friends and family, he also wrote unpublished works of fiction in French.
All these works, including "La nuit est ma femme", "Sur le chemin", and large sections of "Maggie Cassidy" (originally written in French), have now been published together in a volume entitled "La vie est d'hommage" (Boréal, 2016) edited by University of Pennsylvania professor Jean-Christophe Cloutier.
In 1996, the "Nouvelle Revue Française" published excerpts and an article on "La nuit est ma femme", and scholar Paul Maher Jr., in his biography "Kerouac: His Life and Work', " discussed Sur le chemin's plot and characters.
The novella, completed in five days in Mexico during December 1952, is a telling example of Kerouac's attempts at writing in his first language, a language he often called Canuck French.
Kerouac refers to this short novel in a letter addressed to Neal Cassady (who is commonly known as the inspiration for the character Dean Moriarty) dated January 10, 1953.
The published novel runs over 110 pages, having been reconstituted from six distinct files in the Kerouac archive by Professor Cloutier.
Set in 1935, mostly on the East Coast, it explores some of the recurring themes of Kerouac's literature by way of a spoken word narrative.
Even though this work has the same title as one of his best known English novels, it is the original French version of an incomplete translation that would later become "Old Bull in the Bowery" (now published in "The Unknown Kerouac" from the Library of America).
"The Unknown Kerouac," edited by Todd Tietchen, includes Cloutier's translation of "La nuit est ma femme" and the completed translation of "Sur le Chemin" under the title "Old Bull in the Bowery".
"La nuit est ma femme" was written in early 1951 and completed a few days or weeks before he began the original English version of "On the Road", as many scholars, such as Paul Maher Jr., Joyce Johnson, Hassan Melehy, and Yannis Livadas have pointed out.
Kerouac's early writing, particularly his first novel "The Town and the City", was more conventional, and bore the strong influence of Thomas Wolfe.
The technique Kerouac developed that later made him famous was heavily influenced by jazz, especially Bebop, and later, Buddhism, as well as the famous Joan Anderson letter written by Neal Cassady.
The Diamond Sutra was the most important Buddhist text for Kerouac, and "probably one of the three or four most influential things he ever read".
An often overlooked literary influence on Kerouac was James Joyce, whose work he alludes to more than any other author.
Regarding "On the Road", he wrote in a letter to Ginsberg, "I can tell you now as I look back on the flood of language.
Additionally, Kerouac admired Joyce's experimental use of language, as seen in his novel "Visions of Cody", which uses an unconventional narrative as well as a multiplicity of authorial voices.
Artists including Bob Dylan, the Beatles, Patti Smith, Tom Waits, the Grateful Dead, and The Doors all credit Kerouac as a significant influence on their music and lifestyles.
This is especially so with members of the band The Doors, Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek who quote Jack Kerouac and his novel "On the Road" as one of the band's greatest influences.
In his book "Light My Fire: My Life with The Doors", Ray Manzarek (keyboard player of The Doors) wrote "I suppose if Jack Kerouac had never written "On the Road", The Doors would never have existed."
In 1974, the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics was opened in his honor by Allen Ginsberg and Anne Waldman at Naropa University, a private Buddhist university in Boulder, Colorado.
A street, "rue de Jack Kérouac", is named after him in Quebec City, as well as in the hamlet of Kerouac, Lanmeur, Brittany.
In 1997, the house on Clouser Avenue where "The Dharma Bums" was written was purchased by a newly formed non-profit group, The Jack Kerouac Writers in Residence Project of Orlando, Inc.
In 1998, the Chicago Tribune published a story by journalist Oscar J. Corral that described a simmering legal dispute between Kerouac's family and the executor of daughter Jan Kerouac's estate, Gerald Nicosia.
In 2007, Kerouac was awarded a posthumous honorary degree from the University of Massachusetts Lowell.
It chronicles the time in Kerouac's life that led to his novel "Big Sur", with actors, writers, artists, and close friends giving their insight into the book.
An album released to accompany the movie, "One Fast Move or I'm Gone", features Benjamin Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie) and Jay Farrar (Son Volt) performing songs based on Kerouac's "Big Sur".
In 2010, during the first weekend of October, the 25th anniversary of the literary festival "Lowell Celebrates Kerouac" was held in Kerouac's birthplace of Lowell, Massachusetts.
It featured walking tours, literary seminars, and musical performances focused on Kerouac's work and that of the Beat Generation.
A feature film version of "On the Road" was released internationally in 2012, and was directed by Walter Salles and produced by Francis Ford Coppola.
Independent filmmaker Michael Polish directed "Big Sur", based on the novel, with Jean-Marc Barr cast as Kerouac.
While he is best known for his novels, Kerouac is also noted for his poetry.
Many of Kerouac's poems follow the style of his free-flowing, uninhibited prose, also incorporating elements of jazz and Buddhism.
Other well-known poems by Kerouac, such as "Bowery Blues," incorporate jazz rhythms with Buddhist themes of Saṃsāra, the cycle of life and death, and Samadhi, the concentration of composing the mind.
Also, following the jazz / blues tradition, Kerouac's poetry features repetition and themes of the troubles and sense of loss experienced in life.
The text is more sexually explicit than Viking allowed to be published in 1957, and also uses the real names of Kerouac's friends rather than the fictional names he later substituted.
The Kerouac/Burroughs manuscript, "And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks" was published for the first time on November 1, 2008 by Grove Press.
Les Éditions du Boréal, a Montreal-based publishing house, obtained rights from Kerouac's estate to publish a collection of works titled "La vie est d'hommage" (it was released in April 2016).
Both "Sur le chemin" and "La nuit est ma femme" have also been translated to English by Jean-Christophe Cloutier, in collaboration with Kerouac, and were published in 2016 by the Library of America in "The Unknown Kerouac".
