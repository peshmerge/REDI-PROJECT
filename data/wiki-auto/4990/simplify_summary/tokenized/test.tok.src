[CLS] a bain - marie ( ] ; also known as a water bath or double boiler ) , a type of heated bath , is a piece of equipment used in science , industry , and cooking to heat materials gently or to keep materials warm over a period of time . [SEP]
[CLS] a bain - marie is also used to melt ingredients for cooking . [SEP]
[CLS] the double boiler comes in a wide variety of shapes , sizes , and types , but traditionally is a wide , cylindrical , usually metal container made of three or four basic parts : a handle , an outer ( or lower ) container that holds the working fluid , an inner ( or upper ) , smaller container that fits inside the outer one and which holds the material to be heated or cooked , and sometimes a base underneath . [SEP]
[CLS] under the outer container of the bain - marie ( or built into its base ) is a heat source . [SEP]
[CLS] typically the inner container is immersed about halfway into the working fluid . [SEP]
[CLS] the smaller container , filled with the substance to be heated , fits inside the outer container filled with the working fluid ( usually water ) , and the whole is heated at , or below , the base , causing the temperature of the materials in both containers to rise as needed . [SEP]
[CLS] the constant boiling temperature of the water helps to keep contents of the inner pot from boiling or sc ##or ##ching . [SEP]
[CLS] when the working fluid is water and the bain - marie is used at sea level , the maximum temperature of the material in the lower container will not exceed 100 degrees ce ##ls ##ius ( 212 °f ) , the boiling point of water at sea level . [SEP]
[CLS] using different working fluids , for example , oil , in the lower container will result in different maximum temperatures . [SEP]
[CLS] a contemporary alternative to the traditional , liquid - filled bain - marie is the electric " dry - heat " bain - marie , heated by elements below both pots . [SEP]
[CLS] the dry - heat form of electric bain ##s - marie often consume ##s less energy , requires little cleaning , and can be heated more quickly than traditional versions . [SEP]
[CLS] they can also operate at higher temperatures , and are often much less expensive than their traditional counterparts . [SEP]
[CLS] electric bain ##s - marie can also be wet , using either hot water or vapor , or steam , in the heating process . [SEP]
[CLS] the open , bath - type bain - marie heats via a small , hot - water tub ( or " bath " ) , and the va ##pour - type bain - marie heats with sc ##aldi ##ng - hot steam . [SEP]
[CLS] in cooking applications , a bain - marie usually consists of a pan of water in which another container or containers of food to be cooked is placed within the pan of water . [SEP]
[CLS] in small scale soap - making , a bain - marie ' s inherent control over maximum temperature makes it optimal for li ##que ##fying melt - and - pour soap bases prior to mold ##ing them into bars . [SEP]
[CLS] it offers the advantage of maintaining the base in a liquid state , or re ##li ##que ##fying a solid ##ified base , with minimal deterioration . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , using a water bath , traditional wood glue can be melted and kept in a stable liquid state over many hours without damage to the animal proteins it incorporates . [SEP]
[CLS] the name comes from the medieval - latin term " bal ##ne ##um " ( or " bali ##ne ##um " ) " maria ##e " — literally , " mary ' s bath " — from which the french " bain de marie " , or " bain - marie " , is derived . [SEP]
[CLS] the device ' s invention has been popularly attributed to mary the jew ##ess , an ancient al ##chemist . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the water bath was known many centuries earlier ( hip ##po ##crat ##es and theo ##ph ##ras ##tus ) . [SEP]
