[CLS] wood ##wind instruments are a family of musical instruments within the more general category of wind instruments . [SEP]
[CLS] common examples include flute , oboe , clarinet , bass ##oon , and saxophone . [SEP]
[CLS] there are two main types of wood ##wind instruments : flutes and reed instruments ( otherwise called reed pipes ) . [SEP]
[CLS] what differentiate ##s these instruments from other wind instruments is the way in which they produce their sound . [SEP]
[CLS] all wood ##wind ##s produce sound by splitting an exhaled air stream on a sharp edge , such as a reed or a fi ##pp ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] a wood ##wind may be made of any material , not just wood . [SEP]
[CLS] common examples include brass , silver , cane , as well as other metals such as gold and platinum . [SEP]
[CLS] occasionally wood ##wind ##s are made out of earth ##en materials , especially o ##car ##inas . [SEP]
[CLS] flutes produce sound by directing a focused stream of air below the edge of a hole in a cylindrical tube . [SEP]
[CLS] the flute family can be divided into two sub - families : open flutes and closed flutes . [SEP]
[CLS] to produce a sound with an open flute , the player is required to blow a stream of air across a sharp edge that then splits the airs ##tream . [SEP]
[CLS] this split airs ##tream then acts upon the air column contained within the flute ' s hollow causing it to vi ##brate and produce sound . [SEP]
[CLS] examples of open flutes are the transverse flute , pan ##pipe ##s and sha ##ku ##ha ##chi . [SEP]
[CLS] ancient flutes of this variety were often made from tubular sections of plants such as grasses , reed ##s , and hollow ##ed - out tree branches . [SEP]
[CLS] later , flutes were made of metals such as tin , copper , or bronze . [SEP]
[CLS] modern concert flutes are usually made of high - grade metal alloys , usually containing nickel , silver , copper , or gold . [SEP]
[CLS] to produce a sound with a closed flute , the player is required to blow air into a duct . [SEP]
[CLS] this duct acts as a channel bringing the air to a sharp edge . [SEP]
[CLS] as with the open flutes , the air is then split ; this causes the column of air within the closed flute to vi ##brate and produce sound . [SEP]
[CLS] examples of this type of flute include the recorder , o ##car ##ina , and organ pipes . [SEP]
[CLS] reed instruments produce sound by focusing air into a mouth ##piece which then causes a reed , or reed ##s , to vi ##brate . [SEP]
[CLS] similar to flutes , reed pipes are also further divided into two types : single reed and double reed . [SEP]
[CLS] single - reed wood ##wind ##s produce sound by placing a reed onto the opening of a mouth ##piece ( using a liga ##ture ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when air is forced between the reed and the mouth ##piece , the reed causes the air column in the instrument to vi ##brate and produce its unique sound . [SEP]
[CLS] single reed instruments include the clarinet , saxophone , and others such as the cha ##lum ##eau . [SEP]
[CLS] double - reed instruments use two precisely cut , small pieces of cane bound together at the base . [SEP]
[CLS] this form of sound production has been estimated to have originated in the middle to late neolithic period ; its discovery has been attributed to the observation of wind blowing through a split rush . [SEP]
[CLS] the finished , bound reed is inserted into the instrument and vi ##brates as air is forced between the two pieces ( again , causing the air within the instrument to vi ##brate as well ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this family of reed pipes is subdivided further into another two sub - families : exposed double reed , and capped double reed instruments . [SEP]
[CLS] exposed double - reed instruments are played by having the double reed directly between the player ' s lips . [SEP]
[CLS] this family includes instruments such as the oboe , co ##r ang ##lais ( also called english horn ) and bass ##oon , and many types of shaw ##ms throughout the world . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , capped double - reed instruments have the double reed covered by a cap . [SEP]
[CLS] the player blows through a hole in this cap that then directs the air through the reed ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this family includes the cr ##um ##horn . [SEP]
[CLS] bag ##pipe ##s are unique reed pipe instruments since they use two or more double or single reed ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] however , bag ##pipe ##s are functional ##ly the same as a capped double reed instruments since the reed ##s are never in direct contact with player ' s lips . [SEP]
[CLS] free reed aero ##phone instruments are likewise unique since sound is produced by ' free reed ##s ' – small metal tongues arranged in rows within a metal or wooden frame . [SEP]
[CLS] the air ##flow necessary for the instruments sound is generated either by a player ' s breath ( e . g . harmonica ) , or by bell ##ows ( e . g . accordion ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the modern orchestra ' s wood ##wind section typically includes : flutes , oboe ##s , clarinet ##s , and bass ##oons . [SEP]
[CLS] the piccolo , co ##r ang ##lais , bass clarinet , e - flat clarinet , and contra ##bas ##so ##on are commonly used supplementary wood ##wind instruments . [SEP]
[CLS] the section may also on occasion be expanded by the addition of saxophone ( s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the concert band ' s wood ##wind section is typically much larger and more diverse than the orchestra ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] the concert band ' s wood ##wind section typically includes piccolo ##s , flutes , oboe ##s , b ##♭ clarinet ##s , bass clarinet ##s , bass ##oons , alto saxophone ##s , tenor saxophone ##s , and baritone saxophone ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the co ##r ang ##lais , e ##♭ clarinet , alto clarinet , contra - alto clarinet , contra ##bas ##s clarinet , contra ##bas ##so ##on , and soprano saxophone are also used , but not as frequently as the other wood ##wind ##s . [SEP]
