All woodwinds produce sound by splitting an exhaled air stream on a sharp edge, such as a reed or a fipple.
Occasionally woodwinds are made out of earthen materials, especially ocarinas.
Flutes produce sound by directing a focused stream of air below the edge of a hole in a cylindrical tube.
To produce a sound with an open flute, the player is required to blow a stream of air across a sharp edge that then splits the airstream.
This split airstream then acts upon the air column contained within the flute's hollow causing it to vibrate and produce sound.
Ancient flutes of this variety were often made from tubular sections of plants such as grasses, reeds, and hollowed-out tree branches.
Later, flutes were made of metals such as tin, copper, or bronze.
As with the open flutes, the air is then split; this causes the column of air within the closed flute to vibrate and produce sound.
Examples of this type of flute include the recorder, ocarina, and organ pipes.
Reed instruments produce sound by focusing air into a mouthpiece which then causes a reed, or reeds, to vibrate.
Single-reed woodwinds produce sound by placing a reed onto the opening of a mouthpiece (using a ligature).
When air is forced between the reed and the mouthpiece, the reed causes the air column in the instrument to vibrate and produce its unique sound.
Single reed instruments include the clarinet, saxophone, and others such as the chalumeau.
Double-reed instruments use two precisely cut, small pieces of cane bound together at the base.
This form of sound production has been estimated to have originated in the middle to late Neolithic period; its discovery has been attributed to the observation of wind blowing through a split rush.
The finished, bound reed is inserted into the instrument and vibrates as air is forced between the two pieces (again, causing the air within the instrument to vibrate as well).
This family of reed pipes is subdivided further into another two sub-families: exposed double reed, and capped double reed instruments.
On the other hand, Capped double-reed instruments have the double reed covered by a cap.
However, bagpipes are functionally the same as a capped double reed instruments since the reeds are never in direct contact with player's lips.
Free reed aerophone instruments are likewise unique since sound is produced by 'free reeds' – small metal tongues arranged in rows within a metal or wooden frame.
The airflow necessary for the instruments sound is generated either by a player's breath (e.g.
The modern orchestra's woodwind section typically includes: flutes, oboes, clarinets, and bassoons.
The concert band's woodwind section is typically much larger and more diverse than the orchestra's.
The cor anglais, E♭ clarinet, alto clarinet, contra-alto clarinet, contrabass clarinet, contrabassoon, and soprano saxophone are also used, but not as frequently as the other woodwinds.
