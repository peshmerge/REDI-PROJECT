[CLS] the role of a game ##master in a traditional table - top role - playing game ( pencil - and - paper role - playing game ) is to weave the other participants ' player - character stories together , control the non - player aspects of the game , create environments in which the players can interact , and solve any player disputes . [SEP]
[CLS] the basic role of the game ##master is the same in almost all traditional role - playing games , although differing rule sets make the specific duties of the game ##master unique to that system . [SEP]
[CLS] the role of a game ##master in an online game is to enforce the game ' s rules and provide general customer service . [SEP]
[CLS] also , unlike game ##masters in traditional role - playing games , game ##masters for online games in some cases are paid employees . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " game ##master " and the role associated with it could be found in the postal gaming hobby . [SEP]
[CLS] in typical play - by - mail games , players control armies or civilizations and mail their chosen actions to the gm . [SEP]
[CLS] the gm then mail ##s the updated game state to all players on a regular basis . [SEP]
[CLS] usage in a war ##gami ##ng context includes guido ##n games 1973 rules ##et , " iron ##cl ##ad " . [SEP]
[CLS] in a role - playing game context , it was first used by dave ar ##nes ##on while developing his game " black ##moor " in 1971 , although the first usage in print may have been " chi ##val ##ry & so ##rce ##ry " . [SEP]
[CLS] each gaming system has its own name for the role of the game ##master , such as " judge " , " narrator " , " referee " , " director " , or " story ##tell ##er " , and these terms not only describe the role of the game ##master in general but also help define how the game is intended to be run . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the story ##tell ##er system used in white wolf game studio ' s storytelling games calls its gm the " story ##tell ##er " , while the rules - and setting - focused " marvel super heroes " role - playing game calls its gm the " judge " . [SEP]
[CLS] the cartoon inspired role - playing game " too ##n " calls its gm the " animator " . [SEP]
[CLS] a few games apply system - or setting - specific flavor ##ful names to the gm , such as the keeper of arc ##ane lore ( in " call of ct ##hul ##hu " ) ; the holly ##ho ##ck god ( " no ##bilis " , in which the holly ##ho ##ck represents vanity ) , or the most famous of such terms , " dungeon master " ( or " d ##m " ) in " dungeons & dragons " . [SEP]
[CLS] the game ##master prepares the game session for the players and the characters they play ( known as player characters or pcs ) , describes the events taking place and decides on the outcomes of players ' decisions . [SEP]
[CLS] the game ##master also keeps track of non - player characters ( np ##cs ) and random encounters , as well as of the general state of the game world . [SEP]
[CLS] the game session ( or " adventure " ) can be metaphor ##ically described as a play , in which the players are the lead actors , and the gm provides the stage , the scenery , the basic plot on which the improvisation ##al script is built , as well as all the bit parts and supporting characters . [SEP]
[CLS] game ##masters can also be in charge of rpg board games making the events and setting challenges . [SEP]
[CLS] gm ##s may choose to run a game based on a published game world , with the maps and history already in place ; such game worlds often have pre - written adventures . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatively , the gm may build their own world and script their own adventures . [SEP]
[CLS] a good game ##master draws the players into the adventure , making it enjoyable for everyone . [SEP]
[CLS] good game ##masters have quick minds , sharp wits , and rich imagination ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] game ##masters must also maintain game balance : hideous ##ly over ##powered monsters " or " players are no fun . [SEP]
[CLS] it was noted , in 1997 , that those who favor their left - brain such as skilled code writers usually do not make it in the ether ##eal game ##master world of storytelling and verse . [SEP]
[CLS] in early virtual worlds game ##masters served as a moderator or administrator ; in mud game masters were called " wizards " . [SEP]
[CLS] game ##master ##ing in the form found in traditional role - playing games has also been used in a semi - automatic virtual worlds . [SEP]
[CLS] however , human mode ##ration was sometimes considered unfair or out of context in an otherwise automated world . [SEP]
[CLS] as online games expanded , game ##master duties expanded to include being a customer service representative for an online community . [SEP]
[CLS] a game ##master in such a game is either an experienced volunteer player or an employee of the game ' s publisher . [SEP]
[CLS] they enforce the game ' s rules by ban ##ishing spa ##mmer ##s , player killers , cheat ##ers , and hacker ##s and by solving players ' problems by providing general customer service . [SEP]
[CLS] for their tasks they use special tools and characters that allow them to do things like tel ##ep ##ort to players , summon items , and brows ##e logs that record players ' activities . [SEP]
[CLS] often , players who feel dissatisfied with the game will blame the gm ##s directly for any errors or g ##lit ##ches . [SEP]
[CLS] however , this blame is mis ##di ##re ##cted as most gm ##s are not developers and cannot resolve those types of problems . [SEP]
[CLS] the now defunct america online online gaming forum used to use volunteers selected by applications from its user base . [SEP]
[CLS] these people were simply referred to as og ##fs by other members , and their screen ##name ##s were indicative of their position ( i . e . , og ##f moose , etc . ) . [SEP]
[CLS] while membership in the online gaming forum had only one real requirement ( that is , be a member of ao ##l ) , og ##fs were given powers quite similar to ao ##l " guides " and could use them at will to discipline users as they saw appropriate . [SEP]
[CLS] " world of war ##craft " has employees of blizzard entertainment that serve as game ##masters to help users with various problems in gameplay , chat , and other things like account and billing issues . [SEP]
[CLS] a game ##master in this game will communicate with players through chat that has blue text and they will also have a special " gm " tag and blizzard logo in front of their names . [SEP]
[CLS] " runes ##cape " has more than 500 moderator ##s employed by ja ##ge ##x to assist players and perform administrative duties in - game and on the site forums . [SEP]
[CLS] these " ja ##ge ##x moderator ##s " , as they are called , usually have the word " mod " and a gold crown preceding their account names which ordinary players are not permitted to use . [SEP]
[CLS] the game also has " player moderator ##s " and " forum moderator ##s " who are player volunteers helping with mode ##ration , having the ability to mute ( block from chatting ) other players who violate rules . [SEP]
[CLS] " battle ##ground europe " , a medium - sized mm ##of ##ps has a team of " game moderator ##s " , anonymous volunteers who moderate the game . [SEP]

[CLS] note that a few games , notably " never ##win ##ter nights " and " " , are video game adaptations of tablet ##op role - playing games that are played online with one player acting as a traditional game ##master . [SEP]
[CLS] game ##master ##ing , sometimes referred to as orchestra ##tion is used in per ##vas ##ive games to guide players along a trajectory desired by the game author . [SEP]
[CLS] to ensure proper game ##master ##ing can take place , four components are needed : some kind of sensory system to the game allowing the game masters to know current events , providing dynamic game information ; dynamic and static game information lets game masters make informed decisions ; decisions need to be act ##uated into the game , either through the game system or through manual intervention ; and finally a communication structure is needed for both die ##get ##ic or non - die ##get ##ic communication . [SEP]
[CLS] effective game ##master ##ing can require specialized user interfaces that are highly game specific . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes , tablet ##op gm ##s simply can not find players interested in either the same setting , product line , or play style in their local neighborhood . [SEP]
[CLS] the advent of the network ##ed personal computer provided a solution in the form of online chat programs . [SEP]
[CLS] appropriately equipped game ##masters can find players online and a group can meet via chat rooms , forums , or other electronic means . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast to standard tablet ##op procedure ( and to games " designed " to be played online ) , this online chat format significantly changed the balance of duties for a prospective game ##master . [SEP]
[CLS] descriptive text required more preparation , if only via cut - and - paste ; acting and voice skills could not be utilized to get the personality of np ##cs and monsters across , increasing the value of background music ( ' assigned ' in advance or individually chosen ) as a playing aid . [SEP]
[CLS] the gm was likely to need copies of player - character records , being unable to glance at the originals as in normal face - to - face procedure . [SEP]
[CLS] the format also forced the issue ( particularly when participants were not personally acquainted ) of whether to leave all rolling of dice to the gm ( making one ' s own rolls is a privilege not readily surrendered by some players ) , or to trust all players to honestly report the results of their rolls ( the honor system may be strained when it is in a player ' s best interest to roll well ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , work ##around ##s to these challenges have only increased over time . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of wi ##ki software helps gm ##s and players alike keep track of all manner of game data , sometimes evolving into a home - made gaming supplement . [SEP]
[CLS] script ##ing software allows un ##wi ##eld ##y mechanics ( e . g . a complicated formula or repetitive die - rolling ) to be resolved at the push of a button . [SEP]
[CLS] tel ##ec ##on ##fer ##en ##cing enhance ##s group communication through voice , video , and a shared white ##board . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of technology to enable online play is growing , as reflected in products like the d & d insider . [SEP]
