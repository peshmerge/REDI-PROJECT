[CLS] electronics comprises the physics , engineering , technology and applications that deal with the emission , flow and control of electrons in vacuum and matter . [SEP]
[CLS] the ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information - processing possible . [SEP]
[CLS] inter ##con ##ne ##ction technologies such as circuit boards , electronics packaging technology , and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed electronic components into a regular working system , called an electronic system ; examples are computers or control systems . [SEP]
[CLS] s of 2018 most electronic devices use semiconductor components to perform electron control . [SEP]
[CLS] the identification of the electron in 1897 , along with the invention of the vacuum tube , which could amp ##li ##fy and rec ##tify small electrical signals , inaugurated the field of electronics and the electron age . [SEP]
[CLS] electronics deals with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes , trans ##isto ##rs , di ##odes , integrated circuits , opt ##oe ##le ##ct ##ron ##ics , and sensors , associated passive electrical components , and inter ##con ##ne ##ction technologies . the nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amp ##li ##fication of weak signals possible . [SEP]
[CLS] electrical and electro ##me ##chan ##ical science and technology deals with the generation , distribution , switching , storage , and conversion of electrical energy to and from other energy forms ( using wires , motors , generators , batteries , switches , relay ##s , transformers , resist ##ors , and other passive components ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this distinction started around 1906 with the invention by lee de forest of the trio ##de , which made electrical amp ##li ##fication of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non - mechanical device . [SEP]
[CLS] until 1950 , this field was called " radio technology " because its principal application was the design and theory of radio transmitters , receivers , and vacuum tubes . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " solid - state electronics " emerged after the first practical trans ##isto ##r was invented by william shock ##ley , walter house ##r brat ##tain and john bard ##een at bell labs in 1947 . [SEP]
[CLS] the mo ##sf ##et was the first truly compact trans ##isto ##r that could be mini ##at ##uri ##sed and mass - produced for a wide range of uses , revolution ##izing the electronics industry , and playing a central role in the micro ##ele ##ct ##ron ##ics revolution and digital revolution . [SEP]
[CLS] the mo ##sf ##et has since become the basic element in most modern electronic equipment , and is the most widely used electronic device in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] the study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of solid - state physics , whereas the design and construction of electronic circuits to solve practical problems come under electronics engineering . [SEP]
[CLS] an electronic component is any physical entity in an electronic system used to affect the electrons or their associated fields in a manner consistent with the intended function of the electronic system . [SEP]
[CLS] components are generally intended to be connected together , usually by being sold ##ered to a printed circuit board ( pc ##b ) , to create an electronic circuit with a particular function ( for example an amplifier , radio receiver , or os ##ci ##lla ##tor ) . [SEP]
[CLS] they allowed for vastly more complicated systems and gave us radio , television , ph ##ono ##graphs , radar , long - distance tel ##ep ##hony and much more . [SEP]
[CLS] vacuum tubes are still used in some specialist applications such as high power rf amplifiers , cat ##ho ##de ray tubes , specialist audio equipment , guitar amplifiers and some microwave devices . [SEP]
[CLS] from that time on trans ##isto ##rs were almost exclusively used for computer logic and peripheral ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] however , early junction trans ##isto ##rs were relatively bulky devices that were difficult to manufacture on a mass - production basis , which limited them to a number of specialised applications . [SEP]
[CLS] it revolution ##ized the electronics industry , becoming the most widely used electronic device in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] the mo ##sf ##et is the basic element in most modern electronic equipment , and has been central to the electronics revolution , the micro ##ele ##ct ##ron ##ics revolution , and the digital revolution . [SEP]
[CLS] the mo ##sf ##et has thus been credited as the birth of modern electronics , and possibly the most important invention in electronics . [SEP]
[CLS] most analog electronic appliances , such as radio receivers , are constructed from combinations of a few types of basic circuits . [SEP]
[CLS] analog circuits use a continuous range of voltage or current as opposed to discrete levels as in digital circuits . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of different analog circuits so far devised is huge , especially because a ' circuit ' can be defined as anything from a single component , to systems containing thousands of components . [SEP]
[CLS] analog circuits are sometimes called linear circuits although many non - linear effects are used in analog circuits such as mixer ##s , mod ##ulator ##s , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] one rarely finds modern circuits that are entirely analog . [SEP]
[CLS] these days analog circuit ##ry may use digital or even micro ##pro ##ces ##sor techniques to improve performance . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes it may be difficult to differentiate between analog and digital circuits as they have elements of both linear and non - linear operation . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , an over ##drive ##n trans ##isto ##r amplifier can take on the characteristics of a controlled switch having essentially two levels of output . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , many digital circuits are actually implemented as variations of analog circuits similar to this example – after all , all aspects of the real physical world are essentially analog , so digital effects are only realized by con ##stra ##ining analog behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] digital circuits are the most common physical representation of boo ##lean algebra , and are the basis of all digital computers . [SEP]
[CLS] heat generated by electronic circuit ##ry must be dissipated to prevent immediate failure and improve long term reliability . [SEP]
[CLS] means to achieve greater di ##ssi ##pati ##on include heat sinks and fans for air cooling , and other forms of computer cooling such as water cooling . [SEP]
[CLS] noise may be electromagnetic ##ally or thermal ##ly generated , which can be decreased by lowering the operating temperature of the circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] other types of noise , such as shot noise cannot be removed as they are due to limitations in physical properties . [SEP]
[CLS] mathematical methods are integral to the study of electronics . [SEP]
[CLS] to become proficient in electronics it is also necessary to become proficient in the mathematics of circuit analysis . [SEP]
[CLS] circuit analysis is the study of methods of solving generally linear systems for unknown variables such as the voltage at a certain node or the current through a certain branch of a network . [SEP]
[CLS] also important to electronics is the study and understanding of electromagnetic field theory . [SEP]
[CLS] due to the complex nature of electronics theory , laboratory experimentation is an important part of the development of electronic devices . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , electronics labs have consisted of electronics devices and equipment located in a physical space , although in more recent years the trend has been towards electronics lab simulation software , such as circuit ##log ##ix , multi ##si ##m , and ps ##pic ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] today ' s electronics engineers have the ability to design circuits using prem ##anu ##fa ##cture ##d building blocks such as power supplies , semiconductor ##s ( i . e . [SEP]
[CLS] popular names in the ed ##a software world are ni multi ##si ##m , cadence ( or ##ca ##d ) , eagle pc ##b and sc ##hema ##tic , mentor ( pads pc ##b and logic sc ##hema ##tic ) , alt ##ium ( pro ##tel ) , lab ##cent ##re electronics ( pro ##te ##us ) , ge ##da , ki ##ca ##d and many others . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , early electronics often used point to point wiring with components attached to wooden bread ##boards to construct circuits . [SEP]
[CLS] most modern day electronics now use printed circuit boards made of materials such as fr ##4 , or the cheaper ( and less hard - wearing ) synthetic resin bonded paper ( sr ##b ##p , also known as pa ##x ##olin ##e / pa ##x ##olin ( trade marks ) and fr ##2 ) – characterised by its brown colour . [SEP]
[CLS] health and environmental concerns associated with electronics assembly have gained increased attention in recent years , especially for products destined to the european union , with its restriction of hazardous substances directive ( ro ##hs ) and waste electrical and electronic equipment directive ( wee ##e ) , which went into force in july 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] electronic systems design deals with the multi - disciplinary design issues of complex electronic devices and systems , such as mobile phones and computers . [SEP]
[CLS] the subject covers a broad spectrum , from the design and development of an electronic system ( new product development ) to ass ##uring its proper function , service life and disposal . [SEP]
