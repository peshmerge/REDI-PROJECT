[CLS] mis ##o ( み ##そ [UNK] [UNK] ) is a traditional japanese season ##ing produced by fe ##rm ##enting soy ##be ##ans with salt and ko ##ji ( the fungus " as ##per ##gill ##us or ##y ##za ##e " ) and sometimes rice , barley , sea ##weed or other ingredients . [SEP]
[CLS] the result is a thick paste used for sauce ##s and spreads , pick ##ling vegetables or meat ##s , and mixing with dash ##i soup stock to serve as mis ##o soup called , a japanese culinary staple . [SEP]
[CLS] typically , " mis ##o " is salty , but its flavor and aroma depend on various factors in the ingredients and fe ##rm ##entation process . [SEP]
[CLS] the origin of the mis ##o of japan is not completely clear . [SEP]
[CLS] in the mu ##rom ##achi era , buddhist monks discovered that soy ##be ##ans could be ground into a paste , spawning new cooking methods using mis ##o to flavor other foods . [SEP]
[CLS] today , mis ##o is produced industrial ##ly in large quantities , and traditional home - made mis ##o has become a ra ##rity . [SEP]
[CLS] in recent years , many new types of mis ##o have appeared , including ones with added soup stocks or calcium , or made with beans other than soy , or having reduced salt for health , among other varieties , are available . [SEP]
[CLS] lately , producers in other countries have also begun selling mis ##o made from chick ##pe ##as , corn , az ##uki beans , amara ##nt ##h , and qui ##no ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] the wide variety of japanese mis ##o is difficult to classify , but is commonly done by grain type , color , taste , and background . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the soy ##be ##ans used in send ##ai mis ##o are much more coarse ##ly mas ##hed than in normal soy mis ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] the taste , aroma , texture , and appearance of mis ##o all vary by region and season . [SEP]
[CLS] other important variables that contribute to the flavor of a particular mis ##o include temperature , duration of fe ##rm ##entation , salt content , variety of " ko ##ji " , and fe ##rm ##enting vessel . [SEP]
[CLS] although white and red ( " shi ##rom ##iso " and " aka ##mis ##o " ) are the most common types of mis ##os available , different varieties may be preferred in particular regions of japan . [SEP]
[CLS] in the eastern kant ##o region that includes tokyo , the darker brownish " aka ##mis ##o " is popular while in the western kan ##sai region encompassing osaka , kyoto , and kobe , the lighter " shi ##rom ##iso " is preferred . [SEP]
[CLS] mis ##o , depending on the variety , consists of a starter culture called ko ##ji , soy ##be ##ans , and usually a grain ( either rice , barley , or rye ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the mis ##o goes through a two step process ; first creating the ko ##ji , and second the ko ##ji is combined with the other components and the mixture is left to be en ##zy ##matic ##ally digest ##ed , fe ##rm ##ented and aged . [SEP]
[CLS] ko ##ji is produced by introducing the mo ##uld " as ##per ##gill ##us or ##y ##za ##e " onto steamed white rice . [SEP]
[CLS] in the past , the natural presence of " a . or ##y ##za ##e " spores was relied upon to create ko ##ji , but because of the difficulty of producing the culture , tan ##e - ko ##ji is added almost exclusively in both industrial and traditional production of mis ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] tan ##e - ko ##ji is produced much in the same way as ko ##ji , but also has a small portion of wood ash added to the mixture which gives important nutrients to the fungus as well as promotes sp ##or ##ulation . [SEP]
[CLS] " a . or ##y ##za ##e " is an aero ##bic fungus and is the most active fe ##rm ##enting agents in ko ##ji as it produces amy ##lo ##ly ##tic , and pro ##te ##ol ##ytic enzymes which are essential to creating the final mis ##o product . [SEP]
[CLS] amy ##lo ##ytic enzymes such as amy ##lase aid in the breakdown of star ##ch in the grains to sugar and dex ##tri ##n , while pro ##te ##ol ##ytic enzymes such as pro ##tea ##se cat ##aly ##ze the breakdown of proteins into smaller peptide ##s or amino acids . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the strain used to create the sweet ##er white mis ##o would likely produce a higher content of amy ##lo ##ly ##tic enzymes , while comparatively a soy ##be ##an mis ##o might have a higher content of pro ##te ##ol ##ytic enzyme . [SEP]
[CLS] to create optimal conditions for en ##zy ##matic production and the growth of " a . or ##y ##za ##e " , the ko ##ji ' s environment must be carefully regulated . [SEP]
[CLS] temperature , humidity and oxygen content , are all important factors in not only maxim ##izing mo ##uld growth and enzyme production , but to prevent other harmful bacteria from producing . [SEP]
[CLS] once the ko ##ji has reached a desirable flavour profile it is usually mixed with salt to prevent further fe ##rm ##entation . [SEP]
[CLS] although other strains of fungi have been used to produce ko ##ji , " a . or ##y ##za ##e " is the most desirable because of a number of properties , including the fact that it does not produce afl ##ato ##xin . [SEP]
[CLS] outside japan , a popular practice is to add mis ##o only to foods that have cooled to preserve " ko ##ji ##kin " cultures in mis ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , mis ##o and soy foods play a large role in the japanese diet , and many cooked mis ##o dishes are popular . [SEP]
[CLS] it most commonly appears as the main ingredient of mis ##o soup , which is eaten daily by much of the japanese population . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , such dishes have the title " mis ##o " prefix ##ed to their name ( for example , " mis ##o - ud ##on " ) , and have a heavier , earth ##ier flavor and aroma compared to other japanese soup ##s that are not mis ##o - based . [SEP]
[CLS] these pick ##les are typically made from cu ##cum ##ber , dai ##kon , nap ##pa cabbage , or egg ##pl ##ant , and are sweet ##er and less salty than the standard japanese salt pick ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] mis ##o is relatively high in salt which can contribute to increased blood pressure in the small percentage of the population with sodium - sensitive pre ##hy ##per ##tension or hyper ##tension . [SEP]
