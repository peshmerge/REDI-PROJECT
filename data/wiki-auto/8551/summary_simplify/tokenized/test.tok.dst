[CLS] historians of the ancient near east agree that david probably existed around 1000 bce , but that there is little that can be said about him as a historical figure . [SEP]
[CLS] it was initially thought that there were no evidence outside of the bible concerning david , but the tel dan ste ##le , an inscribed stone erected by a king of damascus in the late 9th / early 8th centuries bce to commemorate his victory over two enemy kings , contains the phrase in , " by ##t ##d ##wd " , which most scholars translate as " house of david " .

[CLS] having been told that his younger daughter mic ##hal was in love with david , saul gave her in marriage to david upon david ' s payment in phil ##ist ##ine fore ##skin ##s . [SEP]

[CLS] david realises he has an opportunity to kill saul , but this is not his intention : he secretly cuts off a corner of saul ' s robe , and when saul has left the cave he comes out to pay homage to saul as the king and to demonstrate , using the piece of robe , that he holds no malice towards saul . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar passage occurs in 1 samuel 26 , when david is able to infiltrate saul ' s camp on the hill of ha ##chi ##lah and remove his spear and a jug of water from his side while he and his guards lie asleep . [SEP]
[CLS] saul confesses that he has been wrong to pursue david and bless ##es him . [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] the tel dan ste ##le , an inscribed stone erected by a king of damascus in the late 9th / early 8th centuries bce to commemorate his victory over two enemy kings , contains the phrase , " by ##t ##d ##wd " , which most scholars translate as " house of david " . [SEP]
[CLS] other scholars , such as anson rain ##ey have challenged this reading , but it is likely that this is a reference to a dynasty of the kingdom of judah which traced its ancestry to a founder named david . [SEP]
[CLS] the mesh ##a ste ##le from mo ##ab , dating from approximately the same period , may also contain the name david in two places , although this is less certain than the mention in the tel dan inscription . [SEP]
[CLS] besides the two ste ##les , bible scholar and egypt ##ologist kenneth kitchen suggests that david ' s name also appears in a relief of pharaoh sho ##sh ##en ##q ( usually identified with shi ##sha ##k in the bible , 1 kings 14 : 25 - 27 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the relief claims that sho ##sh ##en ##q raided places in palestine in 92 ##5 bce , and kitchen interpret ##s one place as " heights of david " , which was in southern judah and the ne ##ge ##v where the bible says david took refuge from saul . [SEP]
[CLS] the books of samuel were substantially composed during the time of king josiah at the end of the 7th century bce , extended during the babylonian exile ( 6th century bce ) , and substantially complete by about 550 bce , although further editing was done even after then â€” the silver quarter - she ##kel which saul ' s servant offers to samuel in 1 samuel 9 " almost certainly fix ##es the date of the story in the persian or hellenistic period " . [SEP]
[CLS] the book of chronicles , which tells the story from a different point of view , was probably composed in the period 350 â€“ 300 bce , and uses samuel as its source . [SEP]
[CLS] the authors and editors of samuel and chronicles did not aim to record history , but to promote david ' s reign as inevitable and desirable , and for this reason there is little about david that is concrete and und ##is ##puted . [SEP]
[CLS] the archaeological evidence indicates that in the 10th century bce , the time of david , judah was sparsely inhabited and jerusalem was no more than a small village ; over the following century it slowly evolved from a highland chief ##dom to a kingdom , but always overshadowed by the older and more powerful kingdom of israel to the north . [SEP]
[CLS] the biblical evidence likewise indicates that david ' s judah was something less than a full - fledged monarchy : it often calls him " ne ##gi ##d " , for example , meaning " prince " or " chief " , rather than " mel ##ek " , meaning " king " ; the biblical david sets up none of the complex bureaucracy that a kingdom needs ( even his army is made up of volunteers ) , and his followers are largely related to him and from his small home - area around he ##bron . [SEP]
[CLS] thomas l . thompson rejects the historic ##ity of the biblical narrative : " the history of palestine and of its peoples is very different from the bible ' s narratives , whatever political claims to the contrary may be . [SEP]
[CLS] an independent history of jude ##a during the iron i and iron ii periods has little room for historic ##izing readings of the stories of i - ii samuel and i kings . " [SEP]
[CLS] ami ##hai ma ##zar however , concludes that based on recent archeological findings , like those in city of david , k ##hir ##bet q ##ei ##ya ##fa , tel dan , tel re ##ho ##v , k ##hir ##bat en - nah ##as and others " the deco ##nst ##ru ##ction of united monarchy and the dev ##al ##uation of judah as a state in 9th century is unacceptable interpretation of available historic data " . [SEP]
[CLS] some studies of david have been written : bar ##uch hal ##per ##n has pictured david as a lifelong vassal of ac ##his ##h , the phil ##ist ##ine king of ga ##th ; israel fin ##kel ##stein and neil asher si ##lb ##erman have identified as the oldest and most reliable section of samuel those chapters which describe david as the charismatic leader of a band of outlaws who captures jerusalem and makes it his capital . [SEP]
[CLS] steven mckenzie , associate professor of the hebrew bible at rhodes college and author of " king david : a biography " , argues that david came from a wealthy family , was " ambitious and ruthless " and a tyrant who murdered his opponents , including his own sons . [SEP]
[CLS] israel fin ##kel ##stein and neil asher si ##lb ##erman reject the idea that david ruled over a united monarchy , suggesting instead that he ruled only as a chieftain over the southern kingdom of judah , much smaller than the northern kingdom of israel at that time . [SEP]
[CLS] they po ##sit that israel and judah were still poly ##the ##istic in the time of david and solomon , and that much later seventh - century red ##act ##ors sought to portray a past golden age of a united , mono ##the ##istic monarchy in order to serve contemporary needs . [SEP]
[CLS] jacob l . wright , associate professor of hebrew bible at emory university , has written that the most popular legends about david , including his killing of go ##lia ##th , his affair with baths ##he ##ba , and his ruling of a united kingdom of israel rather than just judah , are the creation of those who lived generations after him , in particular those living in the late persian or hellenistic periods . [SEP]
[CLS] according to one tradition , david was raised as the son of his father jesse and spent his early years herd ##ing his father ' s sheep in the wilderness while his brothers were in school . [SEP]
[CLS] david ' s adultery with baths ##he ##ba is interpreted as only an opportunity to demonstrate the power of rep ##ent ##ance , and the talmud states that it was not adultery at all , quoting a jewish practice of divorce on the eve of battle . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , according to talmud ##ic sources , the death of ur ##iah was not to be considered murder , on the basis that ur ##iah had committed a capital offense by refusing to obey a direct command from the king . [SEP]
[CLS] in jewish legend , david ' s sin with baths ##he ##ba is the punishment for david ' s excessive self - consciousness who had be ##so ##ught god to lead him into temptation so that he might give proof of his con ##stan ##cy as abraham , isaac , and jacob ( who successfully passed the test ) whose names later were united with god ' s , while david eventually failed through the temptation of a woman . [SEP]
[CLS] also , according to the talmud yer ##ush ##al ##mi , david was born and died on the jewish holiday of sha ##vu ##ot ( feast of weeks ) . [SEP]
[CLS] his pie ##ty was said to be so great that his prayers could bring down things from heaven . [SEP]
[CLS] originally an earthly king ruling by divine appointment ( " the an ##oint ##ed one " , as the title messiah had it ) , the " son of david " became in the last two pre - christian centuries the apocalyptic and heavenly one who would deliver israel and usher in a new kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] this was the background to the concept of messiah ##ship in early christianity , which interpreted the career of jesus " by means of the titles and functions assigned to david in the mystic ##ism of the zion cult , in which he served as priest - king and in which he was the media ##tor between god and man " . [SEP]
[CLS] the early church believed that " the life of david fore ##sha ##do ##wed the life of christ ; bethlehem is the birthplace of both ; the shepherd life of david points out christ , the good shepherd ; the five stones chosen to sl ##ay go ##lia ##th are typical of the five wounds ; the betrayal by his trusted counsel ##lor , ac ##hit ##op ##hel , and the passage over the ce ##dron remind us of christ ' s sacred passion . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the david ##ic psalms , as we learn from the new testament , are clearly typical of the future messiah . " [SEP]
[CLS] in the middle ages , " charlemagne thought of himself , and was viewed by his court scholars , as a ' new david ' . [SEP]
[CLS] the linking of david to earthly kings ##hip was reflected in european cathedral windows of the late middle ages , through the device of the tree of jesse , its branches demonstrating how divine kings ##hip descended from jesse , through his son david , to jesus . [SEP]
[CLS] the eastern orthodox church and eastern catholic churches celebrate the feast day of the " holy righteous prophet and king david " on the sunday of the holy fore ##fat ##hers ( two sundays before the great feast of the nat ##ivity of the lord ) , when he is commemorated together with other ancestors of jesus . [SEP]
[CLS] he is also commemorated on the sunday after the nat ##ivity , together with joseph and james , the brother of the lord . [SEP]
[CLS] in european christian culture of the middle ages , david was made a member of the nine worth ##ies , a group of heroes en ##cap ##sul ##ating all the ideal qualities of chi ##val ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] the georgian bag ##rat ##ids and the solomon ##ic dynasty of ethiopia claimed a direct biological descent from him . [SEP]
[CLS] david is an important figure in islam as one of the major prophets sent by god to guide the israeli ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] together with solomon , david gave judgment in a case of damage to the fields ( 21 : 78 ) and david judged the matter between two di ##sp ##uta ##nts in his prayer chamber ( 38 : 21 â€“ 23 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] since there is no mention in the qur ' an of the wrong david did to ur ##iah nor any reference to baths ##he ##ba , muslims reject this narrative . [SEP]
[CLS] his voice is described as having had a capt ##ivating power , weaving its influence not only over man but over all beasts and nature , who would unite with him to praise god . [SEP]
