[CLS] historians of the ancient near east agree that david probably existed around 1000 bce , but that there is little that can be said about him as a historical figure . [SEP]
[CLS] it was initially thought that there were no evidence outside of the bible concerning david , but the tel dan ste ##le , an inscribed stone erected by a king of damascus in the late 9th / early 8th centuries bce to commemorate his victory over two enemy kings , contains the phrase in , " by ##t ##d ##wd " , which most scholars translate as " house of david " .

[CLS] ancient near east historians generally doubt that the united monarchy as described in the bible existed . [SEP]
[CLS] david is richly represented in post - biblical jewish written and oral tradition , and is discussed in the new testament . [SEP]

[CLS] the first book of samuel portrays david as the youngest of the eight sons of jesse of bethlehem . [SEP]
[CLS] his mother is not named in any book of the bible , but the talmud identifies her as ni ##tze ##vet daughter of ada ##el . [SEP]

[CLS] his daughter tam ##ar , by ma ##ach ##ah , is raped by her half - brother am ##non . [SEP]
[CLS] god is angered when saul , israel ' s king , unlawful ##ly offers a sacrifice and later di ##so ##bey ##s a divine command both to kill all of the ama ##le ##kit ##es and to destroy their confiscated property . [SEP]
[CLS] consequently , god sends the prophet samuel to an ##oint a shepherd , david , the youngest son of jesse of bethlehem , to be king instead . [SEP]
[CLS] after god sends an evil spirit to torment saul , his servants recommend that he send for a man skilled in playing the l ##yre . [SEP]
[CLS] a servant proposes david , whom the servant describes as " skill ##ful in playing , a man of valor , a warrior , pr ##ude ##nt in speech , and a man of good presence ; and the lord is with him . " [SEP]
[CLS] david enters saul ' s service as one of the royal armour - bearer ##s and plays the l ##yre to soothe the king . [SEP]
[CLS] war comes between israel and the phil ##ist ##ines , and the giant go ##lia ##th challenges the israeli ##tes to send out a champion to face him in single combat . [SEP]
[CLS] david , sent by his father to bring provisions to his brothers serving in saul ' s army , declares that he can defeat go ##lia ##th . [SEP]
[CLS] refusing the king ' s offer of the royal armour , he kills go ##lia ##th with his sling . [SEP]
[CLS] saul in ##qui ##res the name of the young hero ' s father . [SEP]
[CLS] saul sets david over his army . [SEP]
[CLS] all israel loves david , but his popularity causes saul to fear him ( " what else can he wish but the kingdom ? " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] saul plots his death , but saul ' s son jonathan , one of those who loves david , warns him of his father ' s schemes and david flees . [SEP]
[CLS] he goes first to no ##b , where he is fed by the priest ah ##ime ##le ##ch and given go ##lia ##th ' s sword , and then to ga ##th , the phil ##ist ##ine city of go ##lia ##th , intending to seek refuge with king ac ##his ##h there . [SEP]
[CLS] ac ##his ##h ' s servants or officials question his loyalty , and david sees that he is in danger there . [SEP]

[CLS] jonathan meets with david again and confirms his loyalty to david as the future king . [SEP]
[CLS] after the people of zip ##h not ##ify saul that david is taking refuge in their territory , saul seeks confirmation and plans to capture david in the wilderness of mao ##n , but his attention is diverted by a renewed phil ##ist ##ine invasion and david is able to secure some res ##pit ##e at ein ge ##di . [SEP]
[CLS] returning from battle with the phil ##ist ##ines , saul heads to ein ge ##di in pursuit of david and enters the cave where , as it happens , david and his supporters are hiding , " to attend to his needs " . [SEP]
[CLS] david realises he has an opportunity to kill saul , but this is not his intention : he secretly cuts off a corner of saul ' s robe , and when saul has left the cave he comes out to pay homage to saul as the king and to demonstrate , using the piece of robe , that he holds no malice towards saul . [SEP]
[CLS] the two are thus reconciled and saul recognise ##s david as his successor . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar passage occurs in 1 samuel 26 , when david is able to infiltrate saul ' s camp on the hill of ha ##chi ##lah and remove his spear and a jug of water from his side while he and his guards lie asleep . [SEP]
[CLS] in this account , david is advised by ab ##isha ##i that this is his opportunity to kill saul , but david declines , saying he will not " stretch out his hand against the lord ' s an ##oint ##ed " . [SEP]
[CLS] saul confesses that he has been wrong to pursue david and bless ##es him . [SEP]
[CLS] in , saul cease ##s to pursue david because david took refuge a second time with ac ##his ##h , the phil ##ist ##ine king of ga ##th . [SEP]
[CLS] ac ##his ##h permits david to reside in z ##ik ##lag , close to the border between ga ##th and jude ##a , from where he leads raids against the ge ##shu ##rites , the gi ##rz ##ites and the ama ##le ##kit ##es , but leads ac ##his ##h to believe he is attacking the israeli ##tes in judah , the je ##rah ##me ##eli ##tes and the ken ##ites .

[CLS] ac ##his ##h believes that david had become a loyal vassal , but he never wins the trust of the princes or lords of ga ##th , and at their request ac ##his ##h ins ##truct ##s david to remain behind to guard the camp when the phil ##ist ##ines march against saul . [SEP]
[CLS] david returns to z ##ik ##lag . [SEP]
[CLS] jonathan and saul are killed in battle , and david is an ##oint ##ed king over judah . [SEP]
[CLS] in the north , saul ' s son is ##h - bo ##sh ##eth is an ##oint ##ed king of israel , and war en ##su ##es until is ##h - bo ##sh ##eth is murdered . [SEP]
[CLS] with the death of saul ' s son , the elders of israel come to he ##bron and david is an ##oint ##ed king over all of israel . [SEP]
[CLS] he conquer ##s jerusalem , previously a je ##bus ##ite stronghold , and makes it his capital . [SEP]
[CLS] he brings the ark of the covenant to the city , intending to build a temple for god , but the prophet nathan forbid ##s it , prop ##hes ##ying that the temple would be built by one of david ' s sons . [SEP]
[CLS] nathan also prop ##hes ##ies that god has made a covenant with the house of david stating , " your throne shall be established forever " . [SEP]
[CLS] david wins additional victories over the phil ##ist ##ines , mo ##abi ##tes , edo ##mite ##s , ama ##le ##kit ##es , am ##mon ##ites and king had ##ade ##zer of ara ##m - z ##ob ##ah , after which they become tributaries . [SEP]
[CLS] during a siege of the am ##mon ##ite capital of ra ##bba ##h , david remains in jerusalem . [SEP]
[CLS] he spies a woman , baths ##he ##ba , bathing and summons her ; she becomes pregnant . [SEP]
[CLS] the text in the bible does not explicitly state whether baths ##he ##ba consent ##ed to sex . [SEP]
[CLS] david calls her husband , ur ##iah the hit ##tite , back from the battle to rest , hoping that he will go home to his wife and the child will be presumed to be his . [SEP]
[CLS] ur ##iah does not visit his wife , however , so david con ##sp ##ire ##s to have him killed in the heat of battle . [SEP]
[CLS] david then marries the widowed baths ##he ##ba . [SEP]
[CLS] in response , nathan prop ##hes ##ies the punishment that will fall upon him , stating " the sword shall never depart from your house . " [SEP]
[CLS] when david acknowledges that he has sinn ##ed , nathan advises him that his sin is forgiven and he will not die , but the child will . [SEP]
[CLS] in fulfillment of nathan ' s words , david ' s son abs ##alo ##m , fueled by vengeance and lust for power , rebels . [SEP]
[CLS] abs ##alo ##m ' s forces are routed at the battle of the wood of ep ##hra ##im , and he is caught by his long hair in the branches of a tree where , contrary to david ' s order , he is killed by jo ##ab , the commander of david ' s army . [SEP]
[CLS] david lame ##nts the death of his favourite son : " o my son abs ##alo ##m , my son , my son abs ##alo ##m ! [SEP]
[CLS] would i had died instead of you , o abs ##alo ##m , my son , my son ! " [SEP]
[CLS] until jo ##ab persuade ##s him to recover from " the extra ##va ##gan ##ce of his grief " and to fu ##lf ##il his duty to his people . [SEP]
[CLS] david returns to gil ##gal and is escorted across the river jordan and back to jerusalem by the tribes of judah and benjamin . [SEP]
[CLS] when david is old and bed ##rid ##den , ad ##oni ##jah , his eldest surviving son and natural heir , declares himself king . [SEP]
[CLS] baths ##he ##ba and nathan go to david and obtain his agreement to crown baths ##he ##ba ' s son solomon as king , according to david ' s earlier promise , and the revolt of ad ##oni ##jah is put down . [SEP]
[CLS] david dies at the age of 70 after reigning for 40 years , and on his death ##bed counsel ##s solomon to walk in the ways of god and to take revenge on his enemies . [SEP]
[CLS] the book of samuel calls david a skill ##ful harp ( l ##yre ) player and " the sweet psalm ##ist of israel . " [SEP]
[CLS] yet , while almost half of the psalms are headed " a psalm of david " ( also translated as " to david " or " for david " ) and tradition identifies several with specific events in david ' s life ( e . g . , psalms 3 , 7 , 18 , 34 , 51 , 52 , 54 , 56 , 57 , 59 , 60 , 63 and 142 ) , the heading ##s are late additions and no psalm can be attributed to david with certainty . [SEP]
[CLS] psalm 34 is attributed to david on the occasion of his escape from ab ##ime ##le ##ch ( or king ac ##his ##h ) by pretending to be insane . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the parallel narrative in 1 samuel 21 , instead of killing the man who had exact ##ed so many casualties from him , ab ##ime ##le ##ch allows david to depart , ex ##claiming , " am i so short of mad ##men that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me ? [SEP]
[CLS] must this man come into my house ? " [SEP]
[CLS] the tel dan ste ##le , an inscribed stone erected by a king of damascus in the late 9th / early 8th centuries bce to commemorate his victory over two enemy kings , contains the phrase , " by ##t ##d ##wd " , which most scholars translate as " house of david " . [SEP]
[CLS] other scholars , such as anson rain ##ey have challenged this reading , but it is likely that this is a reference to a dynasty of the kingdom of judah which traced its ancestry to a founder named david . [SEP]
[CLS] the mesh ##a ste ##le from mo ##ab , dating from approximately the same period , may also contain the name david in two places , although this is less certain than the mention in the tel dan inscription . [SEP]
[CLS] besides the two ste ##les , bible scholar and egypt ##ologist kenneth kitchen suggests that david ' s name also appears in a relief of pharaoh sho ##sh ##en ##q ( usually identified with shi ##sha ##k in the bible , 1 kings 14 : 25 - 27 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the relief claims that sho ##sh ##en ##q raided places in palestine in 92 ##5 bce , and kitchen interpret ##s one place as " heights of david " , which was in southern judah and the ne ##ge ##v where the bible says david took refuge from saul . [SEP]
[CLS] the relief is damaged and interpretation is uncertain . [SEP]
[CLS] apart from these , all that is known of david comes from the biblical literature . [SEP]
[CLS] the books of samuel were substantially composed during the time of king josiah at the end of the 7th century bce , extended during the babylonian exile ( 6th century bce ) , and substantially complete by about 550 bce , although further editing was done even after then — the silver quarter - she ##kel which saul ' s servant offers to samuel in 1 samuel 9 " almost certainly fix ##es the date of the story in the persian or hellenistic period " . [SEP]
[CLS] the authors and editors of samuel drew on many earlier sources , including , for their history of david , the " history of david ' s rise " ( 1 samuel 16 : 14 – 2 samuel 5 : 10 ) , and the " succession narrative " ( 2 samuel 9 – 20 and 1 kings 1 – 2 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the book of chronicles , which tells the story from a different point of view , was probably composed in the period 350 – 300 bce , and uses samuel as its source . [SEP]
[CLS] the authors and editors of samuel and chronicles did not aim to record history , but to promote david ' s reign as inevitable and desirable , and for this reason there is little about david that is concrete and und ##is ##puted . [SEP]
[CLS] the archaeological evidence indicates that in the 10th century bce , the time of david , judah was sparsely inhabited and jerusalem was no more than a small village ; over the following century it slowly evolved from a highland chief ##dom to a kingdom , but always overshadowed by the older and more powerful kingdom of israel to the north . [SEP]
[CLS] the biblical evidence likewise indicates that david ' s judah was something less than a full - fledged monarchy : it often calls him " ne ##gi ##d " , for example , meaning " prince " or " chief " , rather than " mel ##ek " , meaning " king " ; the biblical david sets up none of the complex bureaucracy that a kingdom needs ( even his army is made up of volunteers ) , and his followers are largely related to him and from his small home - area around he ##bron . [SEP]
[CLS] beyond this , the full range of possible interpretations is available . [SEP]
[CLS] john bright , in his " history of israel " ( 1981 ) , takes samuel at face value . [SEP]
[CLS] donald b . red ##ford , however , sees all reconstruction ##s from biblical sources for the united monarchy period as examples of " academic wish ##ful thinking " . [SEP]
[CLS] thomas l . thompson rejects the historic ##ity of the biblical narrative : " the history of palestine and of its peoples is very different from the bible ' s narratives , whatever political claims to the contrary may be . [SEP]
[CLS] an independent history of jude ##a during the iron i and iron ii periods has little room for historic ##izing readings of the stories of i - ii samuel and i kings . " [SEP]
[CLS] ami ##hai ma ##zar however , concludes that based on recent archeological findings , like those in city of david , k ##hir ##bet q ##ei ##ya ##fa , tel dan , tel re ##ho ##v , k ##hir ##bat en - nah ##as and others " the deco ##nst ##ru ##ction of united monarchy and the dev ##al ##uation of judah as a state in 9th century is unacceptable interpretation of available historic data " . [SEP]
[CLS] according to ma ##zar , based on archeological evidence ##s , the united monarchy can be described as a " state in development " . [SEP]
[CLS] some studies of david have been written : bar ##uch hal ##per ##n has pictured david as a lifelong vassal of ac ##his ##h , the phil ##ist ##ine king of ga ##th ; israel fin ##kel ##stein and neil asher si ##lb ##erman have identified as the oldest and most reliable section of samuel those chapters which describe david as the charismatic leader of a band of outlaws who captures jerusalem and makes it his capital . [SEP]
[CLS] steven mckenzie , associate professor of the hebrew bible at rhodes college and author of " king david : a biography " , argues that david came from a wealthy family , was " ambitious and ruthless " and a tyrant who murdered his opponents , including his own sons . [SEP]
[CLS] critical bible scholarship holds that the biblical account of david ' s rise to power is a political apology — an answer to contemporary charges against him , of his involvement in murders and reg ##icide . [SEP]
[CLS] israel fin ##kel ##stein and neil asher si ##lb ##erman reject the idea that david ruled over a united monarchy , suggesting instead that he ruled only as a chieftain over the southern kingdom of judah , much smaller than the northern kingdom of israel at that time . [SEP]
[CLS] they po ##sit that israel and judah were still poly ##the ##istic in the time of david and solomon , and that much later seventh - century red ##act ##ors sought to portray a past golden age of a united , mono ##the ##istic monarchy in order to serve contemporary needs . [SEP]
[CLS] they note a lack of archeological evidence for david ' s military campaigns and a relative under ##dev ##elo ##pment of jerusalem , the capital of judah , compared to a more developed and urban ##ized sam ##aria , capital of israel . [SEP]
[CLS] jacob l . wright , associate professor of hebrew bible at emory university , has written that the most popular legends about david , including his killing of go ##lia ##th , his affair with baths ##he ##ba , and his ruling of a united kingdom of israel rather than just judah , are the creation of those who lived generations after him , in particular those living in the late persian or hellenistic periods . [SEP]
[CLS] david is an important figure in rabbi ##nic judaism , with many legends around him . [SEP]
[CLS] according to one tradition , david was raised as the son of his father jesse and spent his early years herd ##ing his father ' s sheep in the wilderness while his brothers were in school . [SEP]
[CLS] david ' s adultery with baths ##he ##ba is interpreted as only an opportunity to demonstrate the power of rep ##ent ##ance , and the talmud states that it was not adultery at all , quoting a jewish practice of divorce on the eve of battle . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , according to talmud ##ic sources , the death of ur ##iah was not to be considered murder , on the basis that ur ##iah had committed a capital offense by refusing to obey a direct command from the king . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in tract ##ate san ##hed ##rin , david expressed remorse over his trans ##gre ##ssion ##s and sought forgiveness . [SEP]
[CLS] god ultimately for ##ga ##ve david and baths ##he ##ba but would not remove their sins from scripture . [SEP]
[CLS] in jewish legend , david ' s sin with baths ##he ##ba is the punishment for david ' s excessive self - consciousness who had be ##so ##ught god to lead him into temptation so that he might give proof of his con ##stan ##cy as abraham , isaac , and jacob ( who successfully passed the test ) whose names later were united with god ' s , while david eventually failed through the temptation of a woman . [SEP]
[CLS] according to mid ##ras ##him , adam gave up 70 years of his life for the life of david . [SEP]
[CLS] also , according to the talmud yer ##ush ##al ##mi , david was born and died on the jewish holiday of sha ##vu ##ot ( feast of weeks ) . [SEP]
[CLS] his pie ##ty was said to be so great that his prayers could bring down things from heaven . [SEP]
[CLS] the concept of the messiah is important in christianity . [SEP]
[CLS] originally an earthly king ruling by divine appointment ( " the an ##oint ##ed one " , as the title messiah had it ) , the " son of david " became in the last two pre - christian centuries the apocalyptic and heavenly one who would deliver israel and usher in a new kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] this was the background to the concept of messiah ##ship in early christianity , which interpreted the career of jesus " by means of the titles and functions assigned to david in the mystic ##ism of the zion cult , in which he served as priest - king and in which he was the media ##tor between god and man " . [SEP]
[CLS] the early church believed that " the life of david fore ##sha ##do ##wed the life of christ ; bethlehem is the birthplace of both ; the shepherd life of david points out christ , the good shepherd ; the five stones chosen to sl ##ay go ##lia ##th are typical of the five wounds ; the betrayal by his trusted counsel ##lor , ac ##hit ##op ##hel , and the passage over the ce ##dron remind us of christ ' s sacred passion . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the david ##ic psalms , as we learn from the new testament , are clearly typical of the future messiah . " [SEP]
[CLS] in the middle ages , " charlemagne thought of himself , and was viewed by his court scholars , as a ' new david ' . [SEP]
[CLS] this was not in itself a new idea , but one whose content and significance were greatly enlarged by him " . [SEP]
[CLS] the linking of david to earthly kings ##hip was reflected in european cathedral windows of the late middle ages , through the device of the tree of jesse , its branches demonstrating how divine kings ##hip descended from jesse , through his son david , to jesus . [SEP]
[CLS] western rite churches ( lutheran , roman catholic ) celebrate his feast day on 29 december , eastern - rite on 19 december . [SEP]
[CLS] the eastern orthodox church and eastern catholic churches celebrate the feast day of the " holy righteous prophet and king david " on the sunday of the holy fore ##fat ##hers ( two sundays before the great feast of the nat ##ivity of the lord ) , when he is commemorated together with other ancestors of jesus . [SEP]
[CLS] he is also commemorated on the sunday after the nat ##ivity , together with joseph and james , the brother of the lord . [SEP]
[CLS] in european christian culture of the middle ages , david was made a member of the nine worth ##ies , a group of heroes en ##cap ##sul ##ating all the ideal qualities of chi ##val ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] his life was thus proposed as a valuable subject for study by those aspiring to chi ##val ##ric status . [SEP]
[CLS] this aspect of david in the nine worth ##ies was popular ##ised firstly through literature , and was thereafter adopted as a frequent subject for painters and sculptors . [SEP]
[CLS] david was considered as a model ruler and a symbol of divine ##ly - ordained monarchy throughout medieval western europe and eastern christ ##end ##om . [SEP]
[CLS] david was perceived as the biblical predecessor to christian roman and byzantine emperors and the name " new david " was used as an honor ##ific reference to these rulers . [SEP]
[CLS] the georgian bag ##rat ##ids and the solomon ##ic dynasty of ethiopia claimed a direct biological descent from him . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , kings of the frankish carol ##ing ##ian dynasty frequently connected themselves to david ; charlemagne himself occasionally used the name of david as his pseudonym . [SEP]
[CLS] david is an important figure in islam as one of the major prophets sent by god to guide the israeli ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] david is mentioned several times in the quran with the arabic name د ##ا ##و ##د , " da ##wu ##d " , often with his son solomon . [SEP]
[CLS] in the qur ' an : david killed go ##lia ##th ( 2 : 251 ) , a giant soldier in the phil ##ist ##ine army . [SEP]
[CLS] when david killed go ##lia ##th , god granted him kings ##hip and wisdom and enforced it ( 38 : 20 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] david was made god ' s " vice ##ger ##ent on earth " ( 38 : 26 ) and god further gave david sound judgment ( 21 : 78 ; 37 : 21 – 24 , 26 ) as well as the psalms , regarded as books of divine wisdom ( 4 : 163 ; 17 : 55 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the birds and mountains united with david in utter ##ing praise to god ( 21 : 79 ; 34 : 10 ; 38 : 18 ) , while god made iron soft for david ( 34 : 10 ) , god also instructed david in the art of fashion ##ing chain - mail out of iron ( 21 : 80 ) ; an indication of the first use of wrought iron , this knowledge gave david a major advantage over his bronze and cast iron - armed opponents , not to mention the cultural and economic impact . [SEP]
[CLS] together with solomon , david gave judgment in a case of damage to the fields ( 21 : 78 ) and david judged the matter between two di ##sp ##uta ##nts in his prayer chamber ( 38 : 21 – 23 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] since there is no mention in the qur ' an of the wrong david did to ur ##iah nor any reference to baths ##he ##ba , muslims reject this narrative . [SEP]
