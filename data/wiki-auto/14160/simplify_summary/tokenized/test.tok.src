[CLS] he ##xa ##meter is a metric ##al line of verses consisting of six feet . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the standard epic metre in classical greek and latin literature , such as in the " il ##iad " , " odyssey " and " ae ##ne ##id " . [SEP]
[CLS] its use in other genres of composition include horace ' s satire ##s , o ##vid ' s " meta ##mo ##rp ##hos ##es , " and the hymns of or ##pheus . [SEP]

[CLS] a short syllable ( υ ) is a syllable with a short vowel and no consonant at the end . [SEP]
[CLS] a long syllable ( – ) is a syllable that either has a long vowel , one or more consonants at the end ( or a long consonant ) , or both . [SEP]
[CLS] spaces between words are not counted in sy ##lla ##bi ##fication , so for instance " cat " is a long syllable in isolation , but " cat attack " would be sy ##lla ##bi ##fied as short - short - long : " ca " , " ta " , " tack " ( υ υ – ) . [SEP]
[CLS] variations of the sequence from line to line , as well as the use of ca ##es ##ura ( logical full stops within the line ) are essential in avoiding what may otherwise be a mono ##ton ##ous sing - song effect . [SEP]
[CLS] although the rules seem simple , it is hard to use classical he ##xa ##meter in english , because english is a stress - timed language that conde ##nse ##s vowels and consonants between stressed syllables , while he ##xa ##meter relies on the regular timing of the phonetic sounds . [SEP]
[CLS] languages having the latter properties ( i . e . , languages that are not stress - timed ) include ancient greek , latin , lithuanian and hungarian . [SEP]
[CLS] while the above classical he ##xa ##meter has never enjoyed much popularity in english , where the standard metre is ia ##mb ##ic pen ##tam ##eter , english poems have frequently been written in ia ##mb ##ic he ##xa ##meter . [SEP]
[CLS] there are numerous examples from the 16th century and a few from the 17th ; the most prominent of these is michael dr ##ayton ' s " poly - ol ##bio ##n " ( 1612 ) in couple ##ts of ia ##mb ##ic he ##xa ##meter . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 17th century the ia ##mb ##ic he ##xa ##meter , also called alexa ##nd ##rine , was used as a substitution in the heroic couple ##t , and as one of the types of per ##missible lines in lyrical stanza ##s and the pin ##dar ##ic ode ##s of cow ##ley and dry ##den . [SEP]
[CLS] several attempts were made in the 19th century to natural ##ise the da ##ct ##yl ##ic he ##xa ##meter to english , by henry wa ##ds ##worth long ##fell ##ow , arthur hugh cl ##ough and others , none of them particularly successful . [SEP]
