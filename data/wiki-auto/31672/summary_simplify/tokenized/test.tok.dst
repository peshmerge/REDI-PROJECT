[CLS] it also has provisions that determine what is to be done when there is no president - elect . [SEP]
[CLS] the amendment was designed largely to limit the " lame duck " period , the period served by congress and the president after an election but before the end of the terms of those who were not re - elected . [SEP]
[CLS] indirectly , the amendment requires the incoming congress , rather than the outgoing congress , to hold a contingent election in the event that no individual wins a majority of the electoral vote in a presidential election . [SEP]
[CLS] the amendment also establishes procedures in the case that a president - elect dies , is not chosen , or otherwise fails to qualify prior to the start of a new presidential term . [SEP]
[CLS] of the constitution states that congress must meet at least once per year , on the first monday in december , though congress could by law set another date and the president could summon special sessions . [SEP]
[CLS] the original text of the constitution set a duration for the terms of federal elected officials , but not the specific dates on which those terms would begin or end . [SEP]
[CLS] in september 1788 , after the necessary nine states had ratified the constitution , the congress of the confederation set march 4 , 1789 , as the date " for commencing proceedings " of the newly reorganized government . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the fact that the new congress and presidential administration did not begin operation until april , march 4 was deemed to be the beginning of the newly elected officials ' terms of office , and thus of the terms of their successors . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution did not specify a date for federal elections , but by the time of the second presidential election in 1792 , congress had passed a law requiring presidential electors to be chosen during november or early december . [SEP]
[CLS] the result of these scheduling decisions was that there was a long , four - month lame duck period between the election and inauguration of the president . [SEP]
[CLS] because article i , section 4 , clause 2 mandated a congressional meeting every december , after the election but before congressional terms of office had expired , a lame duck session was required by the constitution in even - numbered years ; the next session wasn ' t required until the " next " december , meaning that new members of congress might not begin their work until more than a year after they had been elected . [SEP]
[CLS] special sessions sometimes met earlier in the year , but this never became a regular practice , despite the constitution allowing for it . [SEP]
[CLS] the long lame duck period might have been a practical necessity at the end of the 18th century , when any newly elected official might require several months to put his affairs in order and then undertake an ar ##du ##ous journey from his home to the national capital , but it eventually had the effect of imp ##eding the functioning of government in the modern age . [SEP]
[CLS] each institution could do this on the theory that at best , a lame duck congress or administration had neither the time nor the mandate to tackle problems , whereas the incoming administration or congress would have both the time , and a fresh electoral mandate , to examine and address the problems that the nation faced . [SEP]
[CLS] under the constitution at the time , these presidents had to wait four months before they and the incoming congresses could deal with the secession of southern states and the great depression respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] in that case , wilson planned to appoint hughes as secretary of state , at the time first in line to act as president in the event of a simultaneous vacancy in the offices of president and vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 of the twentieth amendment pre ##scribe ##s january 20 , at noon , as the start - finish date for the four - year term of both the president and vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] previously march 4 , the new date shortened the period between election day in november and inauguration day by about six weeks , accelerating the pace of the transfer of presidential power from the out - going president to his successor . [SEP]
[CLS] by changing the date on which presidential terms end and begin , section 1 has superseded the twelfth amendment ' s reference to march 4 as the date by which the house of representatives must — under circumstances where no candidate won an absolute majority of votes for president in the electoral college — conduct a contingent presidential election . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 also specifies january 3 , at noon , as the start - finish date for the terms of members of the senate and the house of representatives ; the previous date had also been march 4 . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result of this change , if the electoral college vote has not resulted in the election of either a president or vice president , the incoming congress , as opposed to the outgoing one , would have to do so , following the process articulated in the twelfth amendment . [SEP]
[CLS] section 3 further ref ##ines the earlier mentioned twelfth amendment provision by declaring that if the president - elect dies before inauguration day , the vice president - elect will be sworn in as president on that day and serve for the full four - year term to which that person was elected ; it further states that if on inauguration day a president - elect has not yet been chosen , or if the president - elect fails to qualify , the vice president - elect would become acting president on inauguration day until a president - elect is chosen or the president - elect qu ##ali ##fies . [SEP]
[CLS] section 3 also author ##izes congress to determine who should be acting president if a new president and vice president have not been chosen by inauguration day . [SEP]
[CLS] previously silent on this point , the lack of guidance nearly caused a constitutional crisis on a couple of occasions : when the house of representatives seemed unable to break the dead ##lock ##ed election of 1800 and when congress seemed unable to resolve the disputed 1876 election . [SEP]
[CLS] roosevelt was not injured , but had the attempt been successful , vice president - elect john nan ##ce garner would have become president on march 4 , 1933 pursuant to section 3 . [SEP]
[CLS] section 4 permits congress to pass a law that cl ##ari ##fies what should occur if either the house of representatives must elect the president and one of the candidates from whom it may choose dies , or the senate must elect the vice president and one of the candidates from whom it may choose dies . [SEP]
[CLS] the first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on the date appointed by the twentieth amendment were the second terms of president roosevelt and vice president garner , on january 20 , 1937 . [SEP]
