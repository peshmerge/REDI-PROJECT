[CLS] the twentieth amendment ( amendment xx ) to the united states constitution moved the beginning and ending of the terms of the president and vice president from march 4 to january 20 , and of members of congress from march 4 to january 3 . [SEP]
[CLS] it also has provisions that determine what is to be done when there is no president - elect . [SEP]
[CLS] the twentieth amendment was adopted on january 23 , 1933 . [SEP]
[CLS] the amendment was designed largely to limit the " lame duck " period , the period served by congress and the president after an election but before the end of the terms of those who were not re - elected . [SEP]
[CLS] indirectly , the amendment requires the incoming congress , rather than the outgoing congress , to hold a contingent election in the event that no individual wins a majority of the electoral vote in a presidential election . [SEP]
[CLS] the amendment also establishes procedures in the case that a president - elect dies , is not chosen , or otherwise fails to qualify prior to the start of a new presidential term . [SEP]
[CLS] of the constitution states that congress must meet at least once per year , on the first monday in december , though congress could by law set another date and the president could summon special sessions . [SEP]
[CLS] the original text of the constitution set a duration for the terms of federal elected officials , but not the specific dates on which those terms would begin or end . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution also specified qualifications for representatives , senators and the president . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it does not explicitly st ##ip ##ulate what was to be done if the electoral college attempted to elect a constitutional ##ly un ##qual ##ified person as president , although some constitutional scholars have argued that the words " inability " and " disability " as stated in article ii were intended to deal with , among other things , any potential case of an " un ##qual ##ified " individual being elected president , including purely technical , legal and constitutional cases and perhaps even mere politically perceived ones . [SEP]
[CLS] in september 1788 , after the necessary nine states had ratified the constitution , the congress of the confederation set march 4 , 1789 , as the date " for commencing proceedings " of the newly reorganized government . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the fact that the new congress and presidential administration did not begin operation until april , march 4 was deemed to be the beginning of the newly elected officials ' terms of office , and thus of the terms of their successors . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution did not specify a date for federal elections , but by the time of the second presidential election in 1792 , congress had passed a law requiring presidential electors to be chosen during november or early december . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1845 , this was narrowed to a single day , in early november . [SEP]
[CLS] congressional elections were generally held on the same day . [SEP]
[CLS] the result of these scheduling decisions was that there was a long , four - month lame duck period between the election and inauguration of the president . [SEP]
[CLS] for congress , the situation was perhaps even more awkward . [SEP]
[CLS] because article i , section 4 , clause 2 mandated a congressional meeting every december , after the election but before congressional terms of office had expired , a lame duck session was required by the constitution in even - numbered years ; the next session wasn ' t required until the " next " december , meaning that new members of congress might not begin their work until more than a year after they had been elected . [SEP]
[CLS] special sessions sometimes met earlier in the year , but this never became a regular practice , despite the constitution allowing for it . [SEP]
[CLS] in practice , congress usually met in a long session beginning in december ##s of odd - numbered years , and in a short lame duck session in december of even - numbered years . [SEP]
[CLS] the long lame duck period might have been a practical necessity at the end of the 18th century , when any newly elected official might require several months to put his affairs in order and then undertake an ar ##du ##ous journey from his home to the national capital , but it eventually had the effect of imp ##eding the functioning of government in the modern age . [SEP]
[CLS] from the early 19th century onward , it also meant that a lame duck congress and presidential administration would fail to adequately respond to a significant national crisis in a timely manner . [SEP]
[CLS] each institution could do this on the theory that at best , a lame duck congress or administration had neither the time nor the mandate to tackle problems , whereas the incoming administration or congress would have both the time , and a fresh electoral mandate , to examine and address the problems that the nation faced . [SEP]
[CLS] these problems very likely would have been at the center of the debate of the just completed election cycle . [SEP]
[CLS] this dilemma was seen most notably in 1861 and 1933 , after the elections of abraham lincoln and franklin d . roosevelt , respectively , plus the newly elected senators and representatives . [SEP]
[CLS] under the constitution at the time , these presidents had to wait four months before they and the incoming congresses could deal with the secession of southern states and the great depression respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1916 , during world war i , president woodrow wilson devised an uno ##rth ##od ##ox plan to avoid a lame duck presidency and allow his republican opponent charles evans hughes to assume presidential powers immediately if hughes had won the election . [SEP]
[CLS] in that case , wilson planned to appoint hughes as secretary of state , at the time first in line to act as president in the event of a simultaneous vacancy in the offices of president and vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] president wilson and vice president thomas r . marshall would have then both resigned . [SEP]
[CLS] the plan was never implemented because wilson was narrowly re - elected . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 of the twentieth amendment pre ##scribe ##s january 20 , at noon , as the start - finish date for the four - year term of both the president and vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] previously march 4 , the new date shortened the period between election day in november and inauguration day by about six weeks , accelerating the pace of the transfer of presidential power from the out - going president to his successor . [SEP]
[CLS] by changing the date on which presidential terms end and begin , section 1 has superseded the twelfth amendment ' s reference to march 4 as the date by which the house of representatives must — under circumstances where no candidate won an absolute majority of votes for president in the electoral college — conduct a contingent presidential election . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 also specifies january 3 , at noon , as the start - finish date for the terms of members of the senate and the house of representatives ; the previous date had also been march 4 . [SEP]
[CLS] section 2 moves the yearly start date of congressional sessions from the first monday in december , as mandated by article i , section 4 , clause 2 , to noon on january 3 of the same year . [SEP]
[CLS] this change eliminated the extended lame duck congressional sessions . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result of this change , if the electoral college vote has not resulted in the election of either a president or vice president , the incoming congress , as opposed to the outgoing one , would have to do so , following the process articulated in the twelfth amendment . [SEP]
[CLS] section 3 further ref ##ines the earlier mentioned twelfth amendment provision by declaring that if the president - elect dies before inauguration day , the vice president - elect will be sworn in as president on that day and serve for the full four - year term to which that person was elected ; it further states that if on inauguration day a president - elect has not yet been chosen , or if the president - elect fails to qualify , the vice president - elect would become acting president on inauguration day until a president - elect is chosen or the president - elect qu ##ali ##fies . [SEP]
[CLS] section 3 also author ##izes congress to determine who should be acting president if a new president and vice president have not been chosen by inauguration day . [SEP]
[CLS] acting on this authority , congress added " failure to qualify " as a possible condition for presidential succession in the presidential succession act of 1947 . [SEP]
[CLS] previously silent on this point , the lack of guidance nearly caused a constitutional crisis on a couple of occasions : when the house of representatives seemed unable to break the dead ##lock ##ed election of 1800 and when congress seemed unable to resolve the disputed 1876 election . [SEP]
[CLS] on february 15 , 1933 , twenty - three days after the amendment was adopted , president - elect roosevelt was the target of an assassination attempt by giuseppe za ##nga ##ra . [SEP]
[CLS] roosevelt was not injured , but had the attempt been successful , vice president - elect john nan ##ce garner would have become president on march 4 , 1933 pursuant to section 3 . [SEP]
[CLS] section 4 permits congress to pass a law that cl ##ari ##fies what should occur if either the house of representatives must elect the president and one of the candidates from whom it may choose dies , or the senate must elect the vice president and one of the candidates from whom it may choose dies . [SEP]
[CLS] congress has never enacted such a statute . [SEP]
[CLS] section 5 delayed sections 1 and 2 taking effect until the first october 15 following the amendment ' s ratification . [SEP]
[CLS] as it was adopted on january 23 , 1933 , section 1 shortened the terms of representatives elected to the 73 ##rd congress ( 1933 – 35 ) , as well as those of senators elected for terms ending in 1935 , 1937 , and 1939 , by days . [SEP]
[CLS] section 5 also resulted in the 73 ##rd congress not being required to meet until january 3 , 1934 . [SEP]
[CLS] the first congress to open its first session on the new date was the 74 ##th congress in 1935 . [SEP]
[CLS] the first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on the date appointed by the twentieth amendment were the second terms of president roosevelt and vice president garner , on january 20 , 1937 . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 had shortened the first term of both ( 1933 – 37 ) by days . [SEP]
[CLS] garner thus served as vice - president for two full terms , but he did not serve a full eight years ( march 4 , 1933 – january 20 , 1941 ) . [SEP]
