the macedonian phalanx is an infantry formation developed by philip ii .
phalanxes remained dominant on battlefields throughout the ancient macedonian period .
philip ii spent much of his youth as a hostage at thebes , where he studied under the renowned general epaminondas .
phalangites were professional soldiers , and were among the first troops ever to be drilled .
they had a leader at the head of each column and a secondary leader in the middle .
each phalangite carried as his primary weapon a sarissa , a double-pointed pike over 6 m ( 18 ft inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches inches length .
before a battle the sarissa were carried in two pieces and then slid together when they were being used .
at close range such large weapons were of little use , but an intact phalanx could easily keep its enemies at a distance .
the men in rows behind the first five angled their spears at a 45 degree angle in an attempt to block arrows or other projectiles .
the secondary weapon was a shortsword called a " kopis " , which had a heavy curved section at the end .
each of its 16 filestorms called " lochoi " foley .
each syntagma was commanded by a " syntagmatarch " , who together with his subordinate officers would form the first row of each block .
the phalanx was used by philip and alexander , who were the cavalry of the phalanx .
the macedonian cavalry fought in wedge formation and was almost always stationed on the far right .
the left side was generally covered by allied cavalry supplied by the thessalians , which fought in rhomboid formation .
other forces — skirmishers , range troops , reserves of allied hoplites , archers , and artillery — were also employed .
