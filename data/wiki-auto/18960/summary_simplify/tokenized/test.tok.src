[CLS] the macedonian ph ##ala ##nx is an infantry formation developed by philip ii and used by his son alexander the great to conquer the ac ##hae ##men ##id empire and other armies . [SEP]
[CLS] philip ii spent much of his youth as a hostage at the ##bes , where he studied under the renowned general epa ##min ##onda ##s , whose reforms were the basis for the ph ##ala ##nx . [SEP]
[CLS] ph ##ala ##ng ##ites were professional soldiers , and were among the first troops ever to be drilled , thereby allowing them to execute complex maneuvers well beyond the reach of most other armies . [SEP]
[CLS] they fought packed in a close rectangular formation , usually eight men deep , with a leader at the head of each column and a secondary leader in the middle , so that the back rows could move off to the sides if more front ##age was needed . [SEP]
[CLS] at close range such large weapons were of little use , but an intact ph ##ala ##nx could easily keep its enemies at a distance ; the weapons of the first five rows of men all projected beyond the front of the formation , so that there were more spear ##points than available targets at any given time . [SEP]
[CLS] men in rows behind the initial five angled their spears at a 45 degree angle in an attempt to ward off arrows or other projectile ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] neither philip nor alexander actually used the ph ##ala ##nx as their arm of choice , but instead used it to hold the enemy in place while their heavy cavalry broke through their ranks . [SEP]
[CLS] the macedonian cavalry fought in wedge formation and was almost always stationed on the far right ; after these broke through the enemy lines they were followed by the h ##yp ##as ##pis ##ts , elite infantry ##men who served as the king ' s bodyguard , and then the ph ##ala ##nx proper . [SEP]
[CLS] the left flank was generally covered by allied cavalry supplied by the the ##ssa ##lian ##s , which fought in r ##hom ##bo ##id formation and served mainly in a defensive role . [SEP]
