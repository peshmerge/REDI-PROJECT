the macedonian phalanx is an infantry formation developed by philip ii .
philip ii spent much of his youth as a hostage at thebes , where he studied under the renowned general epaminondas .
phalangites were professional soldiers , and were among the first troops ever to be drilled .
they had a leader at the head of each column and a secondary leader in the middle .
at close range such large weapons were of little use , but an intact phalanx could easily keep its enemies at a distance .
the men in rows behind the first five angled their spears at a 45 degree angle in an attempt to block arrows or other projectiles .
the phalanx was used by philip and alexander , who were the cavalry of the phalanx .
the macedonian cavalry fought in wedge formation and was almost always stationed on the far right .
the left side was generally covered by allied cavalry supplied by the thessalians , which fought in rhomboid formation .
