the barber of seville is an opera buffa in two acts by gioachino rossini with an italian libretto by cesare sterbini .
the first performance of rossini 's opera silvio was in rome on 20 february 1816 .
rossini 's " barber " has been one of the greatest masterpieces of comedy in music .
mozart 's opera " the marriage of figaro " is based on the second part of the beaumarchais trilogy .
the first beaumarchais play was originally conceived as an opera comique , but was rejected by the comedie-italienne .
the play was first performed in paris in 1775 .
other operas based on the play were composed by giovanni paisiellorrado his " il barbiere di siviglia " premiered in 1782 naples , by nicolas isouard in 1796 , and then by francesco morlacchi in 1816 .
though paisiello triumphed for a time , only rossini 's version is the best of his work .
on 11 november 1868 , two days before rossini 's death , the composer costantino dall ' argine dunlope dunlop gave an opera based on the same libretto as rossini 's work .
rossini was well known for having completed an average of two operas per year for 19 years , and in some years writing as many as four .
the music for " il barbiere di siviglia " was composed in just under three weeks .
the first performance of rossini 's opera at the teatro argentina in rome arbor was on february 20,1816naud was a disaster : the audience hissed and jeered throughout , and several on-stage accidents occurred .
many of the audience were supporters of one of rossini 's rivals , the veteran giovanni paisiello , who played on mob mentality to provoke the rest of the audience to dislike the opera .
in particular paisiello and his followers were opposed to the use of basso buffo , which is common in comic opera .
the play was very poorly received at first , but only to become a favorite within a week .
the opera was first performed in england on 10 march 1818 at the king 's theatre in london .
it was first performed in america on 3 may 1819 .
it was first performed in italian in new york , when manuel garciaylusylusylus played almavivavinsky and his italian troupe opened their first season there with " il barbiere " on 29 november 1825 at the park theatre .
the cast of eight had three other members of his family , including the 17-year-old maria-felicia , later known as maria malibran .
however , it has also been noted that rossini , who frequently altered his music for specific singers , wrote a new aria for josephine fodor-mainvielle , a soprano who had sung rosina in the 1818 london premiere , and sang the new aria c . 1820 at the theatre-italien in paris , where it was published .
once after patti had sung a very florid version of the opera 's legitimate aria , ' una voce poco fa ' , rossini is reported to have asked her : " very nice , my dear , and who wrote the piece you have just performed ? "
the piece is a staple of the operatic repertoire because of a scarcity of true contraltos , the role of rosina has most frequently been sung by a coloratura mezzo-soprano soprano soprano sopranoologist with or without pitch changes , depending on the singer performs .

bartolo decides to know what is in the piece of paper in the hands , but she fools him by giving him a list of clothes .
