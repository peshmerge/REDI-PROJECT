[CLS] the barber of seville , or the useless pre ##ca ##ution ( ] ) is an opera buff ##a in two acts by gi ##oa ##chin ##o rossi ##ni with an italian libretto by cesare ste ##rbin ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] the premiere of rossi ##ni ' s opera ( under the title " alma ##vi ##va , o si ##a l ' in ##uti ##le pre ##ca ##uz ##ion ##e " ) took place on 20 february 1816 at the teatro argentina , rome , with designs by angelo to ##sell ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] rossi ##ni ' s opera recounts the events of the first of the three plays by french playwright pierre beau ##mar ##chai ##s that rev ##ol ##ve around the clever and enter ##pr ##ising character named fig ##aro , the barber of the title . [SEP]
[CLS] mozart ' s opera " the marriage of fig ##aro , " composed 30 years earlier in 1786 , is based on the second part of the beau ##mar ##chai ##s trilogy . [SEP]
[CLS] the play as it is now known was premiered in 1775 by the come ##die - francaise at the theatre des tu ##ile ##ries in paris . [SEP]
[CLS] other operas based on the first play were composed by giovanni pa ##isi ##ello ( his " il barbie ##re di si ##vi ##glia " premiered in 1782 ) , by nicolas iso ##ua ##rd in 1796 , and then by francesco mor ##la ##cchi in 1816 . [SEP]
[CLS] though the work of pa ##isi ##ello triumph ##ed for a time , only rossi ##ni ' s version has stood the test of time and continues to be a main ##sta ##y of operatic repertoire . [SEP]
[CLS] the premiere was not a failure , but critics condemned the " au ##da ##city " of the young composer and the work is now forgotten . [SEP]
[CLS] music ##ologists believe that , true to form , the music for " il barbie ##re di si ##vi ##glia " was composed in just under three weeks , although the famous overture was actually recycled from two earlier rossi ##ni operas , " au ##rel ##iano in palm ##ira " and " elisa ##bet ##ta , regina d ' ing ##hil ##ter ##ra " and thus contains none of the thematic material in " il barbie ##re di si ##vi ##glia " itself . [SEP]
[CLS] the premiere of rossi ##ni ' s opera at the teatro argentina in rome ( 20 february 1816 ) was a disaster : the audience hissed and je ##ered throughout , and several on - stage accidents occurred . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , many of the audience were supporters of one of rossi ##ni ' s rivals , the veteran giovanni pa ##isi ##ello , who played on mob mental ##ity to provoke the rest of the audience to dislike the opera . [SEP]
[CLS] pa ##isi ##ello had already composed " the barber of seville " and took rossi ##ni ' s new version to be an af ##front to his version . [SEP]
[CLS] the original french play , " le barbie ##r de seville " , had a similar story : poorly received at first , only to become a favorite within a week . [SEP]
[CLS] the opera was first performed in england on 10 march 1818 at the king ' s theatre in london in italian , soon followed on 13 october at the covent garden theatre by an english version translated by john fa ##wc ##ett and daniel terry . [SEP]
[CLS] it was first performed in america on 3 may 1819 in english ( probably the covent garden version ) at the park theatre in new york . [SEP]
[CLS] it was given in french at the theatre d ' orleans in new orleans on 4 march 1823 , and became the first opera ever to be performed in italian in new york , when manuel garcia ( who played alma ##vi ##va ) and his italian troupe opened their first season there with " il barbie ##re " on 29 november 1825 at the park theatre . [SEP]
[CLS] the cast of eight had three other members of his family , including the 17 - year - old maria - felicia , later known as maria mali ##bra ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] the most serious distortion has been the upward trans ##position of the role of ro ##sin ##a , turning her from a lust ##rous alto into a per ##t soprano . " [SEP]
[CLS] however , it has also been noted that rossi ##ni , who frequently altered his music for specific singers , wrote a new aria for the second act for josephine f ##od ##or - main ##vie ##lle , a soprano who had sung ro ##sin ##a in the 1818 london premiere , and sang the new aria c . 1820 at the theatre - it ##ali ##en in paris , where it was published . [SEP]
[CLS] ad ##elin ##a patti was known to include luigi ar ##dit ##i ' s " il ba ##cio " , the bo ##ler ##o from verdi ' s " i ve ##sp ##ri sicilian ##i " , the shadow song from meyer ##bee ##r ' s " dino ##rah " , and henry bishop ' s " home ! [SEP]
[CLS] once after patti had sung a particularly fl ##ori ##d rendition of the opera ' s legitimate aria , ' una vo ##ce po ##co fa ' , rossi ##ni is reported to have asked her : " very nice , my dear , and who wrote the piece you have just performed ? " [SEP]
[CLS] the piece is a staple of the operatic repertoire because of a scar ##city of true contra ##lto ##s , the role of ro ##sin ##a has most frequently been sung by a color ##at ##ura me ##zzo - soprano ( with or without pitch alterations , depending on the singer ) , and has in the past , and occasionally in more recent times , been sung by color ##at ##ura soprano ##s such as marcel ##la se ##mb ##rich , maria call ##as , roberta peters , gia ##nna d ' angelo , victoria de los angeles , beverly si ##lls , lily po ##ns , diana dam ##ra ##u , edit ##a gr ##uber ##ova , kathleen battle and lucian ##a serra .

[CLS] ( this aria was originally written in the key of e major , but it is sometimes trans ##posed a semi ##tone up into f major for color ##at ##ura soprano ##s to perform , giving them the chance to sing extra , almost traditional , caden ##za ##s , sometimes reaching high ds or even f ##s . ) [SEP]
[CLS] as she is leaving the room , bart ##olo and basil ##io enter . [SEP]
[CLS] bart ##olo is suspicious of the count , and basil ##io advises that he be put out of the way by creating false rumours about him ( this aria , " la cal ##un ##nia e un vent ##ice ##llo " – " cal ##um ##ny is a little breeze " – is almost always sung a tone lower than the original d major ) .

[CLS] the scene returns to the location of act 1 with a grill looking out onto the square . [SEP]
[CLS] bart ##olo shows ro ##sin ##a the letter she wrote to " lin ##dor ##o " , and persuade ##s her that this is evidence that lin ##dor ##o is merely a flu ##nk ##y of alma ##vi ##va and is toy ##ing with her at alma ##vi ##va ' s be ##hes ##t . [SEP]

[CLS] however , when the count , ro ##sin ##a , and fig ##aro attempt to leave by way of the ladder , they discover it has been removed . [SEP]
[CLS] the count makes basil ##io an offer he can ' t refuse : the choice of accepting a bribe and being a witness to his marriage or receiving two bullets in the head ( an easy choice , basil ##io says ) . [SEP]
[CLS] bart ##olo barges in , accompanied by the officer and the men of the watch , but too late ; the marriage is already complete . [SEP]
