Length is a property of a thing that can be measured.
One of the methods of measurement is either using a ruler or a Geometric Square.
We generally measure the length of small shapes but we have made a range of sizes so you can either have an 'easy to go' degree of accuracy or an close to exact measurement in millimeters, or even more accurate ways of saying that length, the more longer the object seems the lesser the degree of accuracy we tend to measure it.
The length of something is the distance between two ends of the thing.
Short means of small length.
Long means of much length.
Short and long are opposites.
For two dimensional things, length is usually the longer side of measurement.
Length is also a property of time.
An amount of time has a length.

John waits until three o'clock, or 3h.
John stands up at three o'clock, or 3h.

The length of time John was sitting was two hours.
