[CLS] length is a measure of distance . [SEP]
[CLS] in most systems of measurement , the unit of length is a base unit , from which other units are derived . [SEP]
[CLS] length is a measure of one dimension , whereas area is a measure of two dimensions ( length squared ) and volume is a measure of three dimensions ( length cube ##d ) . [SEP]
[CLS] measurement has been important ever since humans settled from nomadic lifestyle ##s and started using building materials , occupying land and trading with neighbours . [SEP]
[CLS] many units of length have been used throughout history and in different civil ##isation ##s and cultures : until quite recently it was common for length units to be differently defined even between neighbouring towns and cities . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance one of the oldest units of length measurement used in the ancient world was the cub ##it , which was the length of the arm from the tip of the finger to the elbow . [SEP]
[CLS] this could then be subdivided into shorter units like the foot , hand ( which at 4 inches is still used today for expressing the height of horses ) or finger , or added together to make longer units like the stride . [SEP]
[CLS] under albert einstein ' s special relativity , length can no longer be thought of as being constant in all reference frames . [SEP]
[CLS] thus a ruler that is one meter long in one frame of reference will not be one meter long in a reference frame that is moving relative to the first frame . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , units of length may have been derived from the lengths of human body parts , the distance traveled in a number of paces , the distance between landmarks or places on the earth , or ar ##bit ##rar ##ily on the length of some common object . [SEP]
[CLS] in the international system of units ( si ) , the basic unit of length is the metre and is now defined in terms of the speed of light . [SEP]
[CLS] units used to denote distances in the vast ##ness of space , as in astronomy , are much longer than those typically used on earth and include the astronomical unit , the light - year , and the par ##se ##c . [SEP]
