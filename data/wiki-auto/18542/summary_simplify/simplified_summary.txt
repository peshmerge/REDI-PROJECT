long means of much length .
in most systems of measurement , the unit of length is a base unit .
length is a measure of one dimension .
measurement has been important since humans settled from nomadic lifestyles and started using building materials , occupying land and trading with neighbours .
many units of length have been used throughout history and in different civilisations and cultures .
for instance one of the oldest units of length measurement used in the ancient world was the cubit , which was the length of the arm from the tip of the finger to the elbow .
this could then be divided into shorter units like the foot .
albert einstein 's special relativity says that length can no longer be thought of as being constant in all reference frames .
thus a ruler that is one meter long in one frame of reference will not be one meter long in a reference frame that is moving relative to the first frame .
historically , units of length may have been derived from the lengths of human body parts , the distance traveled in a number of paces , the distance between landmarks or places on the earth , or arbitrarily on the length of some common object .
in the international system of unitsometric units , the basic unit of length is the metre .
units used to denote distances in the vastness of space , as in astronomy , are much longer than those typically used on earth .
