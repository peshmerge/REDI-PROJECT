Length is a measure of distance.
In most systems of measurement, the unit of length is a base unit, from which other units are derived.
Length is a measure of one dimension, whereas area is a measure of two dimensions (length squared) and volume is a measure of three dimensions (length cubed).
Measurement has been important ever since humans settled from nomadic lifestyles and started using building materials, occupying land and trading with neighbours.
Many units of length have been used throughout history and in different civilisations and cultures: until quite recently it was common for length units to be differently defined even between neighbouring towns and cities.
For instance one of the oldest units of length measurement used in the ancient world was the cubit, which was the length of the arm from the tip of the finger to the elbow.
This could then be subdivided into shorter units like the foot, hand (which at 4 inches is still used today for expressing the height of horses) or finger, or added together to make longer units like the stride.
Under Albert Einstein's special relativity, length can no longer be thought of as being constant in all reference frames.
Thus a ruler that is one meter long in one frame of reference will not be one meter long in a reference frame that is moving relative to the first frame.
Historically, units of length may have been derived from the lengths of human body parts, the distance traveled in a number of paces, the distance between landmarks or places on the Earth, or arbitrarily on the length of some common object.
In the International System of Units (SI), the basic unit of length is the metre and is now defined in terms of the speed of light.
Units used to denote distances in the vastness of space, as in astronomy, are much longer than those typically used on Earth and include the astronomical unit, the light-year, and the parsec.
