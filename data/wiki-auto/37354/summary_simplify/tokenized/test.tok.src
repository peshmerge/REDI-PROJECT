[CLS] in the usual description of english , the basic form , with or without the particle " to " , is the in ##fin ##itive . [SEP]
[CLS] a verb may also agree with the person , gender or number of some of its arguments , such as its subject , or object . [SEP]
[CLS] verbs have tense ##s : present , to indicate that an action is being carried out ; past , to indicate that an action has been done ; future , to indicate that an action will be done . [SEP]
[CLS] in languages where the verb is in ##fle ##cted , it often agrees with its primary argument ( the subject ) in person , number or gender . [SEP]
[CLS] with the exception of the verb " to be " , english shows distinctive agreements only in the third person singular , present tense form of verbs , which are marked by adding " - s " ( " walks ) or " - es " ( " fishes ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the rest of the persons are not distinguished in the verb ( " i walk " , " you walk " , " they walk " , etc . ) . [SEP]
[CLS] latin and the romance languages in ##fle ##ct verbs for tense – aspect – mood ( abbreviated ' tam ' ) , and they agree in person and number ( but not in gender , as for example in polish ) with the subject . [SEP]
[CLS] japanese , like many languages with so ##v word order , in ##fle ##cts verbs for tense - aspect - mood , as well as other categories such as ne ##gation , but shows absolutely no agreement with the subject - it is a strictly dependent - marking language . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , basque , georgian , and some other languages , have " poly ##personal agreement " : the verb agrees with the subject , the direct object , and even the secondary object if present , a greater degree of head - marking than is found in most european languages . [SEP]
[CLS] verbs vary by type , and each type is determined by the kinds of words that accompany it and the relationship those words have with the verb itself . [SEP]
[CLS] classified by the number of their vale ##ncy arguments , usually three basic types are distinguished : intra ##ns ##itive ##s , transit ##ives , di ##tra ##ns ##itive ##s and double transit ##ive verbs . [SEP]
[CLS] some verbs have special grammatical uses and hence complement ##s , such as cop ##ular verbs ( i . e . , be ) ; the verb " do " used for do - support in questioning and ne ##gation , and tense or aspect aux ##ilia ##ries , e . g . , " be " , " have " or " can " . [SEP]
[CLS] intra ##ns ##itive verbs may be followed by an ad ##ver ##b ( a word that addresses how , where , when , and how often ) or end a sentence . [SEP]
[CLS] these noun phrases are not called pre ##dicate nouns , but are instead called direct objects because they refer to the object that is being acted upon . [SEP]
[CLS] di ##tra ##ns ##itive verbs ( sometimes called v ##g verbs after the verb " give " ) pre ##cede either two noun phrases or a noun phrase and then a prep ##osition ##al phrase often led by " to " or " for " . [SEP]
[CLS] when two noun phrases follow a transit ##ive verb , the first is an indirect object , that which is receiving something , and the second is a direct object , that being acted upon . [SEP]
[CLS] double transit ##ive verbs ( sometimes called vc verbs after the verb " consider " ) are followed by a noun phrase that serves as a direct object and then a second noun phrase , adjective , or in ##fin ##itive phrase . [SEP]
[CLS] the second element ( noun phrase , adjective , or in ##fin ##itive ) is called a complement , which completes a clause that would not otherwise have the same meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] linking verbs ) can ' t be followed by an ad ##ver ##b or end a sentence , but instead must be followed by a noun or adjective , whether in a single word or phrase . [SEP]
[CLS] these verbs pre ##cede nouns or adjective ##s in a sentence , which become pre ##dicate nouns and pre ##dicate adjective ##s similar to those that function with a linking verb . [SEP]
[CLS] they can also be followed by an ad ##ver ##b of place , which is sometimes referred to as a pre ##dicate ad ##ver ##b . [SEP]
[CLS] adjective ##s that come after cop ##ular verbs are pre ##dicate adjective ##s , and nouns that come after linking verbs are pre ##dicate nouns . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of arguments that a verb takes is called its " vale ##ncy " or " vale ##nce " . [SEP]
[CLS] weather verbs often appear to be imp ##erson ##al ( subject ##less , or ava ##lent ) in null - subject languages like spanish , where the verb " ll ##ue ##ve " means " it rains " . [SEP]
[CLS] in english , french and german , they require a dummy pro ##no ##un , and therefore formally have a vale ##ncy of 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , as verbs in spanish incorporate the subject as a tam suffix , spanish is not actually a null - subject language , unlike mandarin ( see above ) . [SEP]
[CLS] intra ##ns ##itive and transit ##ive verbs are the most common , but the imp ##erson ##al and objective verbs are somewhat different from the norm . [SEP]
[CLS] in the objective the verb takes an object but no subject ; the non ##re ##fer ##ent subject in some uses may be marked in the verb by an incorporated dummy pro ##no ##un similar to that used with the english weather verbs . [SEP]
[CLS] imp ##erson ##al verbs in null subject languages take neither subject nor object , as is true of other verbs , but again the verb may show incorporated dummy pronouns despite the lack of subject and object phrases . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in english the verb " move " has no grammatical object in " he moves " ( though in this case , the subject itself may be an implied object , also express ##ible explicitly as in " he moves himself " ) ; but in " he moves the car " , the subject and object are distinct and the verb has a different vale ##ncy . [SEP]
[CLS] in kala ##w la ##ga ##w ya of australia , for example , verbs distinguish vale ##ncy by argument agreement suffix ##es and tam endings : " verb structure : " manga - i - number - tam " arrive + active + singular / dual / plural + tam " " verb structure : " manga - ø - number - tam " arrive + attain ##ative + singular / dual / plural + tam " [SEP]
[CLS] the verb stem manga - ' to take / come / arrive ' at the destination takes the active suffix - i ( > manga ##i - ) in the intra ##ns ##itive form , and as a transit ##ive verb the stem is not suffix ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] the tam ending - nu is the general today past attain ##ative perfect ##ive , found with all numbers in the perfect ##ive except the singular active , where - ma is found . [SEP]
[CLS] grammatical tense is the use of auxiliary verbs or in ##fle ##ctions to convey whether the action or state is before , simultaneous with , or after some reference point . [SEP]
[CLS] the reference point could be the time of utter ##ance , in which case the verb expresses absolute tense , or it could be a past , present , or future time of reference previously established in the sentence , in which case the verb expresses relative tense . [SEP]
[CLS] aspect can either be lexi ##cal , in which case the aspect is embedded in the verb ' s meaning ( as in " the sun shine ##s , " where " shine ##s " is lexi ##cal ##ly stat ##ive ) , or it can be grammatical ##ly expressed , as in " i am running . " [SEP]
[CLS] mod ##ality expresses the speaker ' s attitude toward the action or state given by the verb , especially with regard to degree of necessity , obligation , or permission ( " you must go " , " you should go " , " you may go " ) , determination or willingness ( " i will do this no matter what " ) , degree of probability ( " it must be raining by now " , " it may be raining " , " it might be raining " ) , or ability ( " i can speak french " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] all languages can express mod ##ality with ad ##ver ##bs , but some also use verbal forms as in the given examples . [SEP]
[CLS] if the verbal expression of mod ##ality involves in ##fle ##ction , we have the special case of mood ; moods include the indicative ( as in " i am there " ) , the sub ##jun ##ctive ( as in " i wish i " were " there " ) , and the imperative ( " be there ! " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the voice of a verb expresses whether the subject of the verb is performing the action of the verb or whether the action is being performed on the subject . [SEP]
[CLS] most languages have a number of verbal nouns that describe the action of the verb . [SEP]
[CLS] other languages have at ##tri ##bu ##tive verb forms with tense and aspect . [SEP]
[CLS] this is especially common among verb - final languages , where at ##tri ##bu ##tive verb phrases act as relative clauses . [SEP]
