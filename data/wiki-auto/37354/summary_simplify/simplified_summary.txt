in english , the basic form is the infinitive .
a verb may also agree with the person , gender or number of arguments , such as the subject , or object .
verbs have tenses : present , to indicate that an action is being carried out ; past , to indicate that an action has been done ; future , to indicate that an action will be done .
in languages where the verb is inflected , it often agrees with its primary argumentants .
the third person is called "-s " → " -lrb- pronounced -rrb- .
the rest of the persons are not distinguished in the verb singular " i walk " , " you walk " , " they walk " , etc .
the romance languages inflect verbs for tense – aspect – moodisi abbreviated ' tam ' complexion , and they agree in person and numbereux but not in gender .
japanese , like many languages with sov word order , inflects verbs for tense-aspect-mood , as well as other categories such as negation , but shows absolutely no agreement with the subject .
in other languages , basque , georgian , and some other languages , have " polypersonal agreement " : the verb agrees with the subject , the direct object , and even the secondary object if present , a greater degree of head-marking than is found in most european languages .
verbs change by type .
there are three basic types of valency : intransitives , transitives , ditransitives and double transitive verbs .
some verbs have special grammatical uses and so are n't used .
intransitive verbs may be followed by an adverbicative a word that addresses how , when , and how often rhymes or end a sentence .
these noun phrases are not called predicate nouns , but are instead called direct objects because they refer to the object that is being acted upon .
ditransitive verbs are called vg action -lrb- after the verb " give " -rrb- .
when two noun phrases follow a transitive verb , the first is an indirect object , that is receiving something , and the second is a direct object , that being acted upon .
a second noun , infinitive , is called a " second noun " .
the second elementhesis noun phrase , adjective , or infinitiveitiveitiveitiveitive substitution is called a complement .
linking verbs can ' t be followed by an adverb or end a sentence .
these verbs precede nouns in a sentence .
they can also be followed by an adverb of place , which is sometimes referred to as a predicate adverb .
adjectives that come after copular verbs are predicate adjectives , and nouns that come after linking verbs are predicate nouns .
the number of arguments that a verb takes takes is called valency or valence .
weather verbs often appear to be impersonalless , or avalentised in null-subject languages like spanish , where the verb " llueve " means " it rains " .
in english , french and german , they require a dummy pronoun , and therefore formally have a valency of 1 .
however , as verbs in spanish incorporate the subject as a tam suffix , spanish is not a null subject language , unlike mandarin lear .
the most common are intransitive and transitive verbs .
in the objective the verb takes an object but no subject .
impersonal verbs in null subject languages are not true , but again the verb may show dummy pronouns even though the subject and object are not .
in english the verb " move " has no grammatical object in " he moves " .
in kalaw lagaw ya of australia , for example , verbs distinguish valency by argument agreement suffixes and tam endings : " manga-i-number-tam " arrive + + + / dual-tam " arrive + + + + + + + + + + + / / / / / / / / tam " arrive + + + + + + + + + + / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / tam " tam " arrive / / / / / / / / attainative tam " tam " arrive / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / attainative tam " tam " tam " tam " tam " tam " tam " tam " arrive / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
the verb stem manga-' to take / come / arrive ' at the end of the sentence takes the active suffix-i dq > mangai -tase in the intransitive form , and as a transitive verb the stem is not suffixed .
the tam ending-nu is the general today past attainative perfective .
grammatical tense is the use of auxiliary verbs .
the reference point can be the time of utterance .
aspect can either be written in the verb 's meaning meaning buddhism .
modality expresses the speaker 's attitude toward the action or state given by the verb , especially with regard to degree of necessity , obligation , or permission ashore " you must go " , " you should go " , " you may go " percival " , determination or willingness willingness willingness ringo starr " , " i will do this no matter what " it may be , degree of probability i can be spoken by raining , or it may be amended . "
all languages can express modality with adverbs .
if the verbal expression of modality involves inflection , we have the special case of mood .
the voice of a verb is a verb which is performed on the subject .
most languages have a number of verbal nouns that describe the action of the verb .
other languages have attributive verbs forms with tense and aspect .
this is especially common among verb-final languages .
