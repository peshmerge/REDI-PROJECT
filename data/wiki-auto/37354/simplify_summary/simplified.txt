a verb , from the latin " verbum " meaning " word " , is a word used to describe a person who uses words .
in english , the basic form is the infinitive .
in many languages , verbs are inflectedcted .
a verb may also agree with the person , gender or number of arguments , such as the subject , or object .
verbs have tenses : present , to indicate that an action is being carried out ; past , to indicate that an action has been done ; future , to indicate that an action will be done .
in languages where the verb is inflected , it often agrees with its primary argumentants .
the third person is called "-s " → " -lrb- pronounced -rrb- .
the rest of the persons are not distinguished in the verb singular " i walk " , " you walk " , " they walk " , etc .
the romance languages inflect verbs for tense – aspect – moodisi abbreviated ' tam ' complexion , and they agree in person and numbereux but not in gender .
japanese , like many languages with sov word order , inflects verbs for tense-aspect-mood , as well as other categories such as negation , but shows absolutely no agreement with the subject .
in other languages , basque , georgian , and some other languages , have " polypersonal agreement " : the verb agrees with the subject , the direct object , and even the secondary object if present , a greater degree of head-marking than is found in most european languages .
verbs change by type .
there are three basic types of valency : intransitives , transitives , ditransitives and double transitive verbs .
some verbs have special grammatical uses and so are n't used .
verbs can also be nonfinite , namely , not inflected for tense , and have various special forms such as infinitives , participles or gerunds .
verbs that do not have an object are called intransitive verbs .
intransitive verbs may be followed by an adverbicative a word that addresses how , when , and how often rhymes or end a sentence .
for example : " the woman " spoke softly .
" the athlete " ran faster than the official .
a transitive verb is followed by a noun or noun phrase .
these noun phrases are not called predicate nouns , but are instead called direct objects because they refer to the object that is being acted upon .
for example : " my friend " read " the newspaper . "
" the teenager " earned a speeding ticket .
a way to identify a transitive verb is to invert the sentence , making it passive .
for example : " the newspaper " was read " by my friend . "
" a speeding ticket " was earned " by the teenager . "
ditransitive verbs are called vg action -lrb- after the verb " give " -rrb- .
for example : " the players " gave their teammates high fives . "
" the players " gave " high fives to their teammates . "
when two noun phrases follow a transitive verb , the first is an indirect object , that is receiving something , and the second is a direct object , that being acted upon .
indirect objects can be noun phrases or prepositional phrases .
a second noun , infinitive , is called a " second noun " .
the second elementhesis noun phrase , adjective , or infinitiveitiveitiveitiveitive substitution is called a complement .
for example : " the young couple " considers " the neighbors wealthy people . "
" some students " perceive adults quite inaccurately .
sarah said " her project to be the hardest she has ever completed " .
copular verbs verbs repeal can ' t be followed by an adverb or end a sentence .
common copulae include " be " , " seem " , " become " , " look " , and " remain " .
for example : " his mother looked " worried . "
" josh " remained " a reliable friend . "
copulae are thought to ' link ' the adjective or noun to the subject .
the copular verb " be " is used in eight forms : " be " , " is " , " am " , " was " , " were " , " , " being " , and " being " in english .
these verbs precede nouns in a sentence .
they can also be followed by an adverb of place , which is sometimes referred to as a predicate adverb .
for example : " her daughter " was a writing teacher .
the group was " very nervous " .
" my house " is down the street . "
adjectives that come after copular verbs are predicate adjectives , and nouns that come after linking verbs are predicate nouns .
the number of arguments that a verb takes takes is called valency or valence .
verbs can be classified according to their valency : a few english verbs , particularly those concerned with financial transactions , take four arguments , as in pat sold chris a lawnmower for $ 20 .
weather verbs often appear to be impersonalless , or avalentised in null-subject languages like spanish , where the verb " llueve " means " it rains " .
in english , french and german , they require a dummy pronoun , and therefore formally have a valency of 1 .
however , as verbs in spanish incorporate the subject as a tam suffix , spanish is not a null subject language , unlike mandarin lear .
such verbs in spanish also have a valency of 1 .
the most common are intransitive and transitive verbs .
in the objective the verb takes an object but no subject .
impersonal verbs in null subject languages are not true , but again the verb may show dummy pronouns even though the subject and object are not .
verbs are often flexible .
in non-valency marking languages such as english , a transitive verb can often drop its object and become intransitive .
in english the verb " move " has no grammatical object in " he moves " .
some verbs in english , however , have historically come forms that show changes of valency in some verbs , such as fall-felled-felled ,-rose-raised : " raise-raised-" ; " cost-costed-raised " ; " cost-costed-costededededed-raised " ; " cost-costed-costededededed-raised " ; " cost-costedededed-raised-raised-raised-raised " ; " = cost-costedededededededededededededededed-raised-raised-raised " .
valency change is shown by inflecting the verb in order to change the valency .
in kalaw lagaw ya of australia , for example , verbs distinguish valency by argument agreement suffixes and tam endings : " manga-i-number-tam " arrive + + + / dual-tam " arrive + + + + + + + + + + + / / / / / / / / tam " arrive + + + + + + + + + + / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / tam " tam " arrive / / / / / / / / attainative tam " tam " arrive / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / attainative tam " tam " tam " tam " tam " tam " tam " tam " arrive / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
the verb stem manga-' to take / come / arrive ' at the end of the sentence takes the active suffix-i dq > mangai -tase in the intransitive form , and as a transitive verb the stem is not suffixed .
the tam ending-nu is the general today past attainative perfective .
depending on the language , verbs may express " grammatical tense " , " aspect " , or " modality " .
grammatical tense is the use of auxiliary verbs .
the reference point can be the time of utterance .
aspect expresses how the state or state is through time .
aspect can either be written in the verb 's meaning meaning buddhism .
modality expresses the speaker 's attitude toward the action or state given by the verb , especially with regard to degree of necessity , obligation , or permission ashore " you must go " , " you should go " , " you may go " percival " , determination or willingness willingness willingness ringo starr " , " i will do this no matter what " it may be , degree of probability i can be spoken by raining , or it may be amended . "
all languages can express modality with adverbs .
if the modality uses a verb , that auxiliary is called a modal verb .
if the verbal expression of modality involves inflection , we have the special case of mood .
the voice of a verb is a verb which is performed on the subject .
the two most common voices are the active voiceference as in " i saw the car "arth and the passive voiceference as in " the car was seen by me " or simply " the car was seen " .
most languages have a number of verbal nouns that describe the action of the verb .
in the indo-european languages , verbal adjectives are generally called participles .
english has an active participle , also called a participle , and a passive participle , also called a past participle .
the active participle of " break " is " breaking " .
other languages have attributive verbs forms with tense and aspect .
this is especially common among verb-final languages .
