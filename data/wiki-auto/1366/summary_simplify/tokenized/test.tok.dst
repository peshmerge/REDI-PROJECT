[CLS] the ancient greeks wore am ##eth ##yst and carved drinking vessels from it in the belief that it would prevent into ##xi ##cation . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst is a semi ##pre ##cious stone often used in jewelry and is the traditional births ##tone for february . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst is a purple variety of quartz ( si ##o ) and owes its violet color to ir ##rad ##iation , imp ##urities of iron and in some cases other transition metals , and the presence of other trace elements , which result in complex crystal lattice substitution ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the hardness of the mineral is the same as quartz , thus making it suitable for use in jewelry . [SEP]
[CLS] the best varieties of am ##eth ##yst can be found in siberia , sri lanka , brazil and the far east . [SEP]
[CLS] the ideal grade is called " deep siberian " and has a primary purple hue of around 75 – 80 % , with 15 – 20 % blue and ( depending on the light source ) red secondary hue ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ‘ rose de france ’ is defined by its markedly light shade of the purple , reminiscent of a lavender / lila ##c shade . [SEP]
[CLS] green quartz is sometimes incorrectly called green am ##eth ##yst , which is a mis ##no ##mer and not an appropriate name for the material , the proper terminology being pr ##asi ##oli ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] one aspect in the art of lap ##ida ##ry involves correctly cutting the stone to place the color in a way that makes the tone of the finished gem homogeneous . [SEP]
[CLS] often , the fact that sometimes only a thin surface layer of violet color is present in the stone or that the color is not homogeneous makes for a difficult cutting . [SEP]
[CLS] the color of am ##eth ##yst has been demonstrated to result from substitution by ir ##rad ##iation of tri ##valent iron ( fe ) for silicon in the structure , in the presence of trace elements of large ionic radius , and , to a certain extent , the am ##eth ##yst color can naturally result from displacement of transition elements even if the iron concentration is low . [SEP]
[CLS] natural am ##eth ##yst is di ##ch ##roi ##c in reddish violet and blu ##ish violet , but when heated , turns yellow - orange , yellow - brown , or dark brownish and may resemble ci ##tri ##ne , but loses its di ##ch ##roi ##sm , unlike genuine ci ##tri ##ne . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst can fade in tone if over ##ex ##posed to light sources and can be artificial ##ly darkened with adequate ir ##rad ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 19th century , the color of am ##eth ##yst was attributed to the presence of manga ##nese . [SEP]
[CLS] however , since it can be greatly altered and even discharged by heat , the color was believed by some authorities to be from an organic source . [SEP]
[CLS] fe ##rri ##c th ##io ##cy ##ana ##te has been suggested , and sulfur was said to have been detected in the mineral . [SEP]
[CLS] its chemical and physical properties are the same to that of natural am ##eth ##yst and it can not be differentiated with absolute certainty without advanced gem ##mo ##logical testing ( which is often cost - prohibit ##ive ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there is one test based on " brazil law twin ##ning " ( a form of quartz twin ##ning where right and left hand quartz structures are combined in a single crystal ) which can be used to identify synthetic am ##eth ##yst rather easily . [SEP]
[CLS] it is possible to synth ##es ##ize twinned am ##eth ##yst , but this type is not available in large quantities in the market . [SEP]
[CLS] single - crystal quartz is very desirable in the industry , particularly for keeping the regular vibrations necessary for quartz movements in watches and clocks , which is where a lot of synthetic quartz is used . [SEP]
[CLS] on exposure to heat , the ir ##rad ##iation effects can be partially cancelled and am ##eth ##yst generally becomes yellow or even green , and much of the ci ##tri ##ne , cai ##rn ##gor ##m , or yellow quartz of jewelry is said to be merely " burnt am ##eth ##yst " . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst was considered to be a strong anti ##dote against drunken ##ness , which is why wine go ##ble ##ts were often carved from it . [SEP]
[CLS] in his poem " l ' am ##eth ##yst ##e , ou les amour ##s de ba ##cc ##hus et d ' am ##eth ##yst ##e " ( am ##eth ##yst or the loves of ba ##cc ##hus and am ##eth ##yst ##e ) , the french poet remy belle ##au ( 152 ##8 – 157 ##7 ) invented a myth in which ba ##cc ##hus , the god of into ##xi ##cation , of wine , and grapes was pursuing a maiden named am ##eth ##yst ##e , who refused his affection ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] humble ##d by am ##eth ##yst ##e ' s desire to remain cha ##ste , ba ##cc ##hus poured wine over the stone as an offering , dye ##ing the crystals purple . [SEP]
[CLS] variations of the story include that dion ##ys ##us had been insulted by a mortal and swore to sl ##ay the next mortal who crossed his path , creating fierce tigers to carry out his wrath . [SEP]
[CLS] her life was spared by artemis , who transformed the maiden into a statue of pure crystalline quartz to protect her from the brutal claws . [SEP]
[CLS] dion ##ys ##us wept tears of wine in remorse for his action at the sight of the beautiful statue . [SEP]
[CLS] tibetan ##s consider am ##eth ##yst sacred to the buddha and make prayer beads from it . [SEP]
[CLS] in the middle ages , it was considered a symbol of royalty and used to decorate english regal ##ia . [SEP]
[CLS] in the old world , am ##eth ##yst was considered one of the cardinal gems , in that it was one of the five gems ##tones considered precious above all others , until large deposits were found in brazil . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst is produced in abundance from the state of minas gerais in brazil where it occurs in large geo ##des within volcanic rocks . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the hollow ag ##ates of southwestern brazil and uruguay contain a crop of am ##eth ##yst crystals in the interior . [SEP]
[CLS] the largest open ##cast am ##eth ##yst vein in the world is in mai ##ssa ##u , lower austria . [SEP]
[CLS] the largest am ##eth ##yst mine in north america is located in thunder bay , ontario . [SEP]
[CLS] however , since the discovery of extensive deposits in locations such as brazil , it has lost most of its value . [SEP]
[CLS] as am ##eth ##yst is readily available in large structures the value of the gem is not primarily defined by cara ##t weight ; this is different from most gems ##tones where the cara ##t weight exponential ##ly increases the value of the stone . [SEP]
[CLS] the highest grade am ##eth ##yst ( called " deep russian " ) is exceptionally rare and therefore , when one is found , its value is dependent on the demand of collectors . [SEP]
