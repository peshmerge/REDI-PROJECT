The ancient Greeks wore amethyst and carved drinking vessels from it in the belief that it would prevent intoxication.
Amethyst is a semiprecious stone often used in jewelry and is the traditional birthstone for February.
Amethyst is a purple variety of quartz (SiO) and owes its violet color to irradiation, impurities of iron and in some cases other transition metals, and the presence of other trace elements, which result in complex crystal lattice substitutions.
The hardness of the mineral is the same as quartz, thus making it suitable for use in jewelry.
The best varieties of amethyst can be found in Siberia, Sri Lanka, Brazil and the far East.
The ideal grade is called "Deep Siberian" and has a primary purple hue of around 75–80%, with 15–20% blue and (depending on the light source) red secondary hues.
‘Rose de France’ is defined by its markedly light shade of the purple, reminiscent of a lavender/lilac shade.
Green quartz is sometimes incorrectly called green amethyst, which is a misnomer and not an appropriate name for the material, the proper terminology being prasiolite.
One aspect in the art of lapidary involves correctly cutting the stone to place the color in a way that makes the tone of the finished gem homogeneous.
Often, the fact that sometimes only a thin surface layer of violet color is present in the stone or that the color is not homogeneous makes for a difficult cutting.
The color of amethyst has been demonstrated to result from substitution by irradiation of trivalent iron (Fe) for silicon in the structure, in the presence of trace elements of large ionic radius, and, to a certain extent, the amethyst color can naturally result from displacement of transition elements even if the iron concentration is low.
Natural amethyst is dichroic in reddish violet and bluish violet, but when heated, turns yellow-orange, yellow-brown, or dark brownish and may resemble citrine, but loses its dichroism, unlike genuine citrine.
Amethyst can fade in tone if overexposed to light sources and can be artificially darkened with adequate irradiation.
In the 19th century, the color of amethyst was attributed to the presence of manganese.
However, since it can be greatly altered and even discharged by heat, the color was believed by some authorities to be from an organic source.
Ferric thiocyanate has been suggested, and sulfur was said to have been detected in the mineral.
Its chemical and physical properties are the same to that of natural amethyst and it can not be differentiated with absolute certainty without advanced gemmological testing (which is often cost-prohibitive).
There is one test based on "Brazil law twinning" (a form of quartz twinning where right and left hand quartz structures are combined in a single crystal) which can be used to identify synthetic amethyst rather easily.
It is possible to synthesize twinned amethyst, but this type is not available in large quantities in the market.
Single-crystal quartz is very desirable in the industry, particularly for keeping the regular vibrations necessary for quartz movements in watches and clocks, which is where a lot of synthetic quartz is used.
On exposure to heat, the irradiation effects can be partially cancelled and amethyst generally becomes yellow or even green, and much of the citrine, cairngorm, or yellow quartz of jewelry is said to be merely "burnt amethyst".
Amethyst was considered to be a strong antidote against drunkenness, which is why wine goblets were often carved from it.
In his poem "L'Amethyste, ou les Amours de Bacchus et d'Amethyste" (Amethyst or the loves of Bacchus and Amethyste), the French poet Remy Belleau (1528–1577) invented a myth in which Bacchus, the god of intoxication, of wine, and grapes was pursuing a maiden named Amethyste, who refused his affections.
Humbled by Amethyste's desire to remain chaste, Bacchus poured wine over the stone as an offering, dyeing the crystals purple.
Variations of the story include that Dionysus had been insulted by a mortal and swore to slay the next mortal who crossed his path, creating fierce tigers to carry out his wrath.
Her life was spared by Artemis, who transformed the maiden into a statue of pure crystalline quartz to protect her from the brutal claws.
Dionysus wept tears of wine in remorse for his action at the sight of the beautiful statue.
Tibetans consider amethyst sacred to the Buddha and make prayer beads from it.
In the Middle Ages, it was considered a symbol of royalty and used to decorate English regalia.
In the Old World, amethyst was considered one of the Cardinal gems, in that it was one of the five gemstones considered precious above all others, until large deposits were found in Brazil.
Amethyst is produced in abundance from the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil where it occurs in large geodes within volcanic rocks.
Many of the hollow agates of southwestern Brazil and Uruguay contain a crop of amethyst crystals in the interior.
The largest opencast amethyst vein in the world is in Maissau, Lower Austria.
The largest amethyst mine in North America is located in Thunder Bay, Ontario.
However, since the discovery of extensive deposits in locations such as Brazil, it has lost most of its value.
As amethyst is readily available in large structures the value of the gem is not primarily defined by carat weight; this is different from most gemstones where the carat weight exponentially increases the value of the stone.
The highest grade amethyst (called "Deep Russian") is exceptionally rare and therefore, when one is found, its value is dependent on the demand of collectors.
