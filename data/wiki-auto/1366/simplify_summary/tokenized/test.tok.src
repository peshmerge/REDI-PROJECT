[CLS] am ##eth ##yst is a violet variety of quartz . [SEP]
[CLS] the name comes from the ko ##ine greek α ##μ ##ε ##θ ##υ ##σ ##τ ##ος " am ##eth ##yst ##os " from α - " a - " , " not " and μ ##ε ##θ ##υ ##σ ##κ ##ω " met ##hy ##sko " / μ ##ε ##θ ##υ ##ω " met ##hy ##o " , " into ##xi ##cate " , a reference to the belief that the stone protected its owner from drunken ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] the ancient greeks wore am ##eth ##yst and carved drinking vessels from it in the belief that it would prevent into ##xi ##cation . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst is a semi ##pre ##cious stone often used in jewelry and is the traditional births ##tone for february . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst is a purple variety of quartz ( si ##o ) and owes its violet color to ir ##rad ##iation , imp ##urities of iron and in some cases other transition metals , and the presence of other trace elements , which result in complex crystal lattice substitution ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the hardness of the mineral is the same as quartz , thus making it suitable for use in jewelry . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst occurs in primary hue ##s from a light pink ##ish violet to a deep purple . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst may exhibit one or both secondary hue ##s , red and blue . [SEP]
[CLS] the best varieties of am ##eth ##yst can be found in siberia , sri lanka , brazil and the far east . [SEP]
[CLS] the ideal grade is called " deep siberian " and has a primary purple hue of around 75 – 80 % , with 15 – 20 % blue and ( depending on the light source ) red secondary hue ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ‘ rose de france ’ is defined by its markedly light shade of the purple , reminiscent of a lavender / lila ##c shade . [SEP]
[CLS] these pale colors , were once considered und ##es ##ira ##ble but have recently become popular due to intensive marketing . [SEP]
[CLS] green quartz is sometimes incorrectly called green am ##eth ##yst , which is a mis ##no ##mer and not an appropriate name for the material , the proper terminology being pr ##asi ##oli ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] other names for green quartz are ve ##rma ##rine or lime ci ##tri ##ne . [SEP]
[CLS] of very variable intensity , the color of am ##eth ##yst is often laid out in stripes parallel to the final faces of the crystal . [SEP]
[CLS] one aspect in the art of lap ##ida ##ry involves correctly cutting the stone to place the color in a way that makes the tone of the finished gem homogeneous . [SEP]
[CLS] often , the fact that sometimes only a thin surface layer of violet color is present in the stone or that the color is not homogeneous makes for a difficult cutting . [SEP]
[CLS] the color of am ##eth ##yst has been demonstrated to result from substitution by ir ##rad ##iation of tri ##valent iron ( fe ) for silicon in the structure , in the presence of trace elements of large ionic radius , and , to a certain extent , the am ##eth ##yst color can naturally result from displacement of transition elements even if the iron concentration is low . [SEP]
[CLS] natural am ##eth ##yst is di ##ch ##roi ##c in reddish violet and blu ##ish violet , but when heated , turns yellow - orange , yellow - brown , or dark brownish and may resemble ci ##tri ##ne , but loses its di ##ch ##roi ##sm , unlike genuine ci ##tri ##ne . [SEP]
[CLS] when partially heated , am ##eth ##yst can result in am ##et ##rine . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst can fade in tone if over ##ex ##posed to light sources and can be artificial ##ly darkened with adequate ir ##rad ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst was used as a gems ##tone by the ancient egyptians and was largely employed in antiquity for int ##ag ##lio engraved gems . [SEP]
[CLS] the greeks believed am ##eth ##yst gems could prevent into ##xi ##cation , while medieval european soldiers wore am ##eth ##yst amulet ##s as protection in battle in the belief that am ##eth ##yst ##s heal people and keep them cool - headed . [SEP]
[CLS] beads of am ##eth ##yst were found in anglo - saxon graves in england . [SEP]
[CLS] anglican bishops wear an episcopal ring often set with an am ##eth ##yst , an all ##usion to the description of the apostles as " not drunk " at pen ##tec ##ost in acts 2 : 15 . [SEP]
[CLS] a large geo ##de , or " am ##eth ##yst - gr ##otto " , from near santa cruz in southern brazil was presented at a 1902 exhibition in dusseldorf , germany . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 19th century , the color of am ##eth ##yst was attributed to the presence of manga ##nese . [SEP]
[CLS] however , since it can be greatly altered and even discharged by heat , the color was believed by some authorities to be from an organic source . [SEP]
[CLS] fe ##rri ##c th ##io ##cy ##ana ##te has been suggested , and sulfur was said to have been detected in the mineral . [SEP]
[CLS] synthetic ( laboratory - grown ) am ##eth ##yst is produced by a synthesis method called hydro ##thermal growth , which grows the crystals inside a high - pressure auto ##clave . [SEP]
[CLS] synthetic am ##eth ##yst is made to im ##itate the best quality am ##eth ##yst . [SEP]
[CLS] its chemical and physical properties are the same to that of natural am ##eth ##yst and it can not be differentiated with absolute certainty without advanced gem ##mo ##logical testing ( which is often cost - prohibit ##ive ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there is one test based on " brazil law twin ##ning " ( a form of quartz twin ##ning where right and left hand quartz structures are combined in a single crystal ) which can be used to identify synthetic am ##eth ##yst rather easily . [SEP]
[CLS] it is possible to synth ##es ##ize twinned am ##eth ##yst , but this type is not available in large quantities in the market . [SEP]
[CLS] single - crystal quartz is very desirable in the industry , particularly for keeping the regular vibrations necessary for quartz movements in watches and clocks , which is where a lot of synthetic quartz is used . [SEP]
[CLS] treated am ##eth ##yst is produced by gamma ray , x - ray or electron beam ir ##rad ##iation of clear quartz ( rock crystal ) which has been first do ##ped with fe ##rri ##c imp ##urities . [SEP]
[CLS] on exposure to heat , the ir ##rad ##iation effects can be partially cancelled and am ##eth ##yst generally becomes yellow or even green , and much of the ci ##tri ##ne , cai ##rn ##gor ##m , or yellow quartz of jewelry is said to be merely " burnt am ##eth ##yst " . [SEP]
[CLS] the greek word " am ##eth ##yst ##os " may be translated as " not drunken " , from greek " a - " , " not " + " met ##hus ##tos " , " into ##xi ##cated " . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst was considered to be a strong anti ##dote against drunken ##ness , which is why wine go ##ble ##ts were often carved from it . [SEP]
[CLS] in his poem " l ' am ##eth ##yst ##e , ou les amour ##s de ba ##cc ##hus et d ' am ##eth ##yst ##e " ( am ##eth ##yst or the loves of ba ##cc ##hus and am ##eth ##yst ##e ) , the french poet remy belle ##au ( 152 ##8 – 157 ##7 ) invented a myth in which ba ##cc ##hus , the god of into ##xi ##cation , of wine , and grapes was pursuing a maiden named am ##eth ##yst ##e , who refused his affection ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst ##e prayed to the gods to remain cha ##ste , a prayer which the cha ##ste goddess diana answered , transforming her into a white stone . [SEP]
[CLS] humble ##d by am ##eth ##yst ##e ' s desire to remain cha ##ste , ba ##cc ##hus poured wine over the stone as an offering , dye ##ing the crystals purple . [SEP]
[CLS] variations of the story include that dion ##ys ##us had been insulted by a mortal and swore to sl ##ay the next mortal who crossed his path , creating fierce tigers to carry out his wrath . [SEP]
[CLS] the mortal turned out to be a beautiful young woman , am ##eth ##yst ##os , who was on her way to pay tribute to artemis . [SEP]
[CLS] her life was spared by artemis , who transformed the maiden into a statue of pure crystalline quartz to protect her from the brutal claws . [SEP]
[CLS] dion ##ys ##us wept tears of wine in remorse for his action at the sight of the beautiful statue . [SEP]
[CLS] the god ' s tears then stained the quartz purple . [SEP]
[CLS] this myth and its variations are not found in classical sources . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the titan rhea does present dion ##ys ##us with an am ##eth ##yst stone to preserve the wine - drink ##er ' s sanity in historical text . [SEP]
[CLS] tibetan ##s consider am ##eth ##yst sacred to the buddha and make prayer beads from it . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst is considered the births ##tone of february . [SEP]
[CLS] in the middle ages , it was considered a symbol of royalty and used to decorate english regal ##ia . [SEP]
[CLS] in the old world , am ##eth ##yst was considered one of the cardinal gems , in that it was one of the five gems ##tones considered precious above all others , until large deposits were found in brazil . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst is produced in abundance from the state of minas gerais in brazil where it occurs in large geo ##des within volcanic rocks . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the hollow ag ##ates of southwestern brazil and uruguay contain a crop of am ##eth ##yst crystals in the interior . [SEP]
[CLS] art ##iga ##s , uruguay and neighboring brazilian state rio grande do sul are large world producers exceeding in quantity minas gerais , as well as mat ##o gross ##o , es ##pi ##rito santo , bahia , and ce ##ara states , all am ##eth ##yst producers of importance in brazil . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also found and mined in south korea . [SEP]
[CLS] the largest open ##cast am ##eth ##yst vein in the world is in mai ##ssa ##u , lower austria . [SEP]
[CLS] much fine am ##eth ##yst comes from russia , especially from near mu ##rs ##ink ##a in the ek ##ater ##in ##burg district , where it occurs in dr ##us ##y ca ##vi ##ties in gran ##itic rocks . [SEP]
[CLS] many localities in south india yield am ##eth ##yst . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the largest global am ##eth ##yst producers is zambia in southern africa with an annual production of about 1000 tons . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst occurs at many localities in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] among these may be mentioned : the ma ##za ##tz ##al mountain region in gil ##a and mari ##co ##pa counties , arizona ; red feather lakes , near ft collins , colorado ; am ##eth ##yst mountain , texas ; yellowstone national park ; delaware county , pennsylvania ; hay ##wood county , north carolina ; deer hill and st ##ow , maine and in the lake superior region of minnesota , wisconsin and michigan . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##eth ##yst is relatively common in the canadian provinces of ontario and nova scotia . [SEP]
[CLS] the largest am ##eth ##yst mine in north america is located in thunder bay , ontario . [SEP]
[CLS] up until the 18th century , am ##eth ##yst was included in the cardinal , or most valuable , gems ##tones ( along with diamond , sapphire , ruby , and emerald ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , since the discovery of extensive deposits in locations such as brazil , it has lost most of its value . [SEP]
[CLS] collectors look for depth of color , possibly with red flashes if cut conventional ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] as am ##eth ##yst is readily available in large structures the value of the gem is not primarily defined by cara ##t weight ; this is different from most gems ##tones where the cara ##t weight exponential ##ly increases the value of the stone . [SEP]
[CLS] the biggest factor in the value of am ##eth ##yst is the color displayed . [SEP]
[CLS] the highest grade am ##eth ##yst ( called " deep russian " ) is exceptionally rare and therefore , when one is found , its value is dependent on the demand of collectors . [SEP]
[CLS] it is , however , still orders of magnitude lower than the highest grade sapphire ##s or rub ##ies . [SEP]
