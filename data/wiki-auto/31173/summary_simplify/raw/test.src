Telesto is a moon of Saturn.
It was discovered by Smith, Reitsema, Larson and Fountain in 1980 from ground-based observations, and was provisionally designated S/1980 S 13 .
In the following months, several other apparitions were observed: S/1980 S 24 , S/1980 S 33 , and S/1981 S 1 .
It is also designated as Saturn XIII (13) or Tethys B.
Telesto is co-orbital with Tethys, residing in Tethys' leading Lagrangian point (L ).
This relationship was first identified by Seidelmann "et al."
Another moon, Calypso, resides in the other (trailing) Lagrangian point of Tethys, 60 degrees in the other direction from Tethys.
