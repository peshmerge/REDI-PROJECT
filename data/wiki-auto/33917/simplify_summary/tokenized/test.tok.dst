[CLS] william i ( c . 102 ##8 – 9 september 108 ##7 ) , usually known as william the conqueror and sometimes william the bastard , was the first norman king of england , reigning from 106 ##6 until his death in 108 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] a descendant of roll ##o , he was duke of normandy from 103 ##5 onward . [SEP]
[CLS] after a long struggle to establish his power , by 106 ##0 his hold on normandy was secure , and he launched the norman conquest of england six years later . [SEP]
[CLS] the rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over england and his continental lands and by difficulties with his eldest son . [SEP]
[CLS] william was the son of the unmarried robert i , duke of normandy , by robert ' s mistress her ##lev ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] his illegitimate status and his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father , as did the anarchy that plagued the first years of his rule . [SEP]
[CLS] during his childhood and adolescence , members of the norman aristocracy battled each other , both for control of the child duke and for their own ends . [SEP]
[CLS] in 104 ##7 william was able to qu ##ash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy , a process that was not complete until about 106 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] his marriage in the 105 ##0s to matilda of flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of flanders . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time of his marriage , william was able to arrange the appointment of his supporters as bishops and abbot ##s in the norman church . [SEP]
[CLS] his consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons , and by 106 ##2 william secured control of the neighbouring county of maine . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 105 ##0s and early 106 ##0s william became a contender for the throne of england , then held by the childless edward the confess ##or , his first cousin once removed . [SEP]
[CLS] there were other potential claim ##ants , including the powerful english earl harold god ##win ##son , who was named the next king by edward on the latter ' s death ##bed in january 106 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] william argued that edward had previously promised the throne to him and that harold had sworn to support william ' s claim . [SEP]
[CLS] william built a large fleet and invaded england in september 106 ##6 , decisive ##ly defeating and killing harold at the battle of hastings on 14 october 106 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] after further military efforts william was crowned king on christmas day 106 ##6 , in london . [SEP]
[CLS] he made arrangements for the governance of england in early 106 ##7 before returning to normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] several unsuccessful rebellion ##s followed , and by 107 ##5 william ' s hold on england was mostly secure , allowing him to spend the majority of the rest of his reign on the continent . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s final years were marked by difficulties in his continental domains , troubles with his eldest son , and threatened invasions of england by the danes . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1086 william ordered the compilation of the " domesday book " , a survey listing all the land ##holding ##s in england along with their pre - conquest and current holders . [SEP]
[CLS] william died in september 108 ##7 while leading a campaign in northern france , and was buried in ca ##en . [SEP]
[CLS] his reign in england was marked by the construction of castles , the settling of a new norman nobility on the land , and change in the composition of the english clergy . [SEP]
[CLS] he did not try to integrate his various domains into one empire but instead continued to administer each part separately . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s lands were divided after his death : normandy went to his eldest son , robert curt ##hos ##e , and his second surviving son , william rufus , received england . [SEP]
[CLS] norse ##men first began raiding in what became normandy in the late 8th century . [SEP]
[CLS] permanent scandinavian settlement occurred before 911 , when roll ##o , one of the viking leaders , and king charles the simple of france reached an agreement surrender ##ing the county of rouen to roll ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] the lands around rouen became the core of the later duchy of normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] normandy may have been used as a base when scandinavian attacks on england were renewed at the end of the 10th century , which would have worsened relations between england and normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] in an effort to improve matters , king æ ##the ##lr ##ed the un ##rea ##dy took emma of normandy , sister of duke richard ii , as his second wife in 100 ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] danish raids on england continued , and æ ##the ##lr ##ed sought help from richard , taking refuge in normandy in 101 ##3 when king sw ##ein i of denmark drove æ ##the ##lr ##ed and his family from england . [SEP]
[CLS] sw ##ein ' s death in 101 ##4 allowed æ ##the ##lr ##ed to return home , but sw ##ein ' s son cn ##ut contested æ ##the ##lr ##ed ' s return . [SEP]
[CLS] æ ##the ##lr ##ed died unexpectedly in 1016 , and cn ##ut became king of england . [SEP]
[CLS] æ ##the ##lr ##ed and emma ' s two sons , edward and alfred , went into exile in normandy while their mother , emma , became cn ##ut ' s second wife . [SEP]
[CLS] after cn ##ut ' s death in 103 ##5 , the english throne fell to harold hare ##foot , his son by his first wife , while hart ##ha ##c ##nut , his son by emma , became king in denmark . [SEP]
[CLS] alfred returned to england in 103 ##6 to visit his mother and perhaps to challenge harold as king . [SEP]
[CLS] one story imp ##lica ##tes earl god ##win of wessex in alfred ' s subsequent death , but others blame harold . [SEP]
[CLS] emma went into exile in flanders until hart ##ha ##c ##nut became king following harold ' s death in 104 ##0 , and his half - brother edward followed hart ##ha ##c ##nut to england ; edward was proclaimed king after hart ##ha ##c ##nut ' s death in june 104 ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] william was born in 102 ##7 or 102 ##8 at fa ##laise , duchy of normandy , most likely towards the end of 102 ##8 . [SEP]
[CLS] he was the only son of duke robert i , son of duke richard ii . [SEP]
[CLS] his mother , her ##lev ##a , was the daughter of fu ##lbert of fa ##laise ; fu ##lbert may have been a tanner or em ##bal ##mer . [SEP]
[CLS] she was possibly a member of the duc ##al household , but did not marry robert . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , she later married her ##lu ##in de con ##te ##ville , with whom she had two sons – o ##do of bay ##eux and robert , count of mort ##ain – and a daughter whose name is unknown . [SEP]
[CLS] one of her ##lev ##a ' s brothers , walter , became a supporter and protector of william during his minority . [SEP]
[CLS] robert also had a daughter , adelaide , by another mistress . [SEP]
[CLS] robert became duke of normandy on 6 august 102 ##7 , succeeding his elder brother richard iii , who had only succeeded to the title the previous year . [SEP]
[CLS] robert and his brother had been at odds over the succession , and richard ' s death was sudden . [SEP]
[CLS] robert was accused by some writers of killing his brother , a plausible but now un ##pro ##vable charge . [SEP]
[CLS] conditions in normandy were un ##sett ##led , as noble families des ##po ##iled the church and alan iii of brittany wage ##d war against the duchy , possibly in an attempt to take control . [SEP]
[CLS] by 103 ##1 robert had gathered considerable support from noble ##men , many of whom would become prominent during william ' s life . [SEP]
[CLS] they included robert ' s uncle , robert the archbishop of rouen , who had originally opposed the duke , os ##ber ##n , a nephew of gunn ##or the wife of duke richard i , and count gilbert of br ##ion ##ne , a grandson of richard i . [SEP]
[CLS] after his accession , robert continued norman support for the english princes edward and alfred , who were still in exile in northern france . [SEP]
[CLS] there are indications that robert may have been briefly bet ##rot ##hed to a daughter of king cn ##ut , but no marriage took place . [SEP]
[CLS] it is unclear if william would have been su ##pp ##lan ##ted in the duc ##al succession if robert had had a legitimate son . [SEP]
[CLS] earlier dukes had been illegitimate , and william ' s association with his father on duc ##al charters appears to indicate that william was considered robert ' s most likely heir . [SEP]
[CLS] in 103 ##4 duke robert decided to go on pilgrimage to jerusalem . [SEP]
[CLS] although some of his supporters tried to di ##ss ##ua ##de him from undertaking the journey , robert convened a council in january 103 ##5 and had the assembled norman magnate ##s swear fe ##al ##ty to william as his heir before leaving for jerusalem . [SEP]
[CLS] he died in early july at nice ##a , on his way back to normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] william faced several challenges on becoming duke , including his illegitimate birth and his youth : the evidence indicates that he was either seven or eight years old at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] he enjoyed the support of his great - uncle , archbishop robert , as well as the king of france , henry i , enabling him to succeed to his father ' s duchy . [SEP]
[CLS] the support given to the exiled english princes in their attempt to return to england in 103 ##6 shows that the new duke ' s guardians were attempting to continue his father ' s policies , but archbishop robert ' s death in march 103 ##7 removed one of william ' s main supporters , and conditions in normandy quickly descended into chaos . [SEP]
[CLS] the anarchy in the duchy lasted until 104 ##7 , and control of the young duke was one of the priorities of those contend ##ing for power . [SEP]
[CLS] at first , alan of brittany had custody of the duke , but when alan died in either late 103 ##9 or october 104 ##0 , gilbert of br ##ion ##ne took charge of william . [SEP]
[CLS] gilbert was killed within months , and another guardian , tu ##rch ##eti ##l , was also killed around the time of gilbert ' s death . [SEP]
[CLS] yet another guardian , os ##ber ##n , was slain in the early 104 ##0s in william ' s chamber while the duke slept . [SEP]
[CLS] it was said that walter , william ' s maternal uncle , was occasionally forced to hide the young duke in the houses of peasants , although this story may be an em ##bell ##ishment by order ##ic vital ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] the historian eleanor sea ##rle spec ##ulates that william was raised with the three cousins who later became important in his career – william fitz ##os ##ber ##n , roger de beaumont , and roger of montgomery . [SEP]
[CLS] although many of the norman nobles engaged in their own private wars and feud ##s during william ' s minority , the viscount ##s still acknowledged the duc ##al government , and the ecclesiastical hierarchy was supportive of william . [SEP]
[CLS] king henry continued to support the young duke , but in late 104 ##6 opponents of william came together in a rebellion centred in lower normandy , led by guy of burgundy with support from nigel , viscount of the cote ##nti ##n , and ran ##ulf , viscount of the be ##ssi ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] according to stories that may have legendary elements , an attempt was made to seize william at val ##og ##nes , but he escaped under cover of darkness , seeking refuge with king henry . [SEP]
[CLS] in early 104 ##7 henry and william returned to normandy and were victorious at the battle of val - es - dunes near ca ##en , although few details of the actual fighting are recorded . [SEP]
[CLS] william of po ##iti ##ers claimed that the battle was won mainly through william ' s efforts , but earlier accounts claim that king henry ' s men and leadership also played an important part . [SEP]
[CLS] william assumed power in normandy , and shortly after the battle prom ##ul ##gated the truce of god throughout his duchy , in an effort to limit warfare and violence by restricting the days of the year on which fighting was permitted . [SEP]
[CLS] although the battle of val - es - dunes marked a turning point in william ' s control of the duchy , it was not the end of his struggle to gain the upper hand over the nobility . [SEP]
[CLS] the period from 104 ##7 to 105 ##4 saw almost continuous warfare , with lesser crises continuing until 106 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s next efforts were against guy of burgundy , who retreated to his castle at br ##ion ##ne , which william besieged . [SEP]
[CLS] after a long effort , the duke succeeded in ex ##iling guy in 105 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] to address the growing power of the count of an ##jou , geoffrey mart ##el , william joined with king henry in a campaign against him , the last known cooperation between the two . [SEP]
[CLS] they succeeded in capturing an ang ##ev ##in fortress , but accomplished little else . [SEP]
[CLS] geoffrey attempted to expand his authority into the county of maine , especially after the death of hugh iv of maine in 105 ##1 . [SEP]
[CLS] central to the control of maine were the holdings of the belle ##me family , who held belle ##me on the border of maine and normandy , as well as the fortress ##es at ale ##nco ##n and dom ##front . [SEP]
[CLS] belle ##me ' s over ##lord was the king of france , but dom ##fort was under the over ##lord ##ship of geoffrey mart ##el and duke william was ale ##nco ##n ' s over ##lord . [SEP]
[CLS] the belle ##me family , whose lands were quite strategically placed between their three different over ##lord ##s , were able to play each of them against the other and secure virtual independence for themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] on the death of hugh of maine , geoffrey mart ##el occupied maine in a move contested by william and king henry ; eventually , they succeeded in driving geoffrey from the county , and in the process , william was able to secure the belle ##me family stronghold ##s at ale ##nco ##n and dom ##fort for himself . [SEP]
[CLS] he was thus able to assert his over ##lord ##ship over the belle ##me family and com ##pel them to act consistently in norman interests . [SEP]
[CLS] but in 105 ##2 the king and geoffrey mart ##el made common cause against william at the same time as some norman nobles began to contest william ' s increasing power . [SEP]
[CLS] henry ' s about - face was probably motivated by a desire to retain dominance over normandy , which was now threatened by william ' s growing mastery of his duchy . [SEP]
[CLS] william was engaged in military actions against his own nobles throughout 105 ##3 , as well as with the new archbishop of rouen , ma ##uge ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 105 ##4 the king and the norman rebels launched a double invasion of the duchy . [SEP]
[CLS] henry led the main thrust through the county of ev ##re ##ux , while the other wing , under the french king ' s brother o ##do , invaded eastern normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] william met the invasion by dividing his forces into two groups . [SEP]
[CLS] the first , which he led , faced henry . [SEP]
[CLS] the second , which included some who became william ' s firm supporters , such as robert , count of eu , walter gi ##ffa ##rd , roger of mort ##eme ##r , and william de ware ##nne , faced the other invading force . [SEP]
[CLS] this second force defeated the invaders at the battle of mort ##eme ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to ending both invasions , the battle allowed the duke ' s ecclesiastical supporters to de ##pose ma ##uge ##r from the archbishop ##ric of rouen . [SEP]
[CLS] mort ##eme ##r thus marked another turning point in william ' s growing control of the duchy , although his conflict with the french king and the count of an ##jou continued until 106 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] henry and geoffrey led another invasion of normandy in 105 ##7 but were defeated by william at the battle of var ##avi ##lle . [SEP]
[CLS] this was the last invasion of normandy during william ' s lifetime . [SEP]
[CLS] in 105 ##8 , william invaded the county of dr ##eux and took till ##iere ##s - sur - av ##re and th ##ime ##rt . [SEP]
[CLS] henry attempted to di ##sl ##od ##ge william , but the siege of th ##ime ##rt dragged on for two years until henry ' s death . [SEP]
[CLS] the deaths of count geoffrey and the king in 106 ##0 cement ##ed the shift in the balance of power towards william . [SEP]
[CLS] one factor in william ' s favour was his marriage to matilda of flanders , the daughter of count baldwin v of flanders . [SEP]
[CLS] the union was arranged in 104 ##9 , but pope leo ix forbade the marriage at the council of r ##heim ##s in october 104 ##9 . [SEP]
[CLS] the marriage nevertheless went ahead some time in the early 105 ##0s , possibly un ##san ##ction ##ed by the pope . [SEP]
[CLS] according to a late source not generally considered to be reliable , papal san ##ction was not secured until 105 ##9 , but as papal - norman relations in the 105 ##0s were generally good , and norman clergy were able to visit rome in 105 ##0 without incident , it was probably secured earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] papal san ##ction of the marriage appears to have required the founding of two monasteries in ca ##en – one by william and one by matilda . [SEP]
[CLS] the marriage was important in bo ##lster ##ing william ' s status , as flanders was one of the more powerful french territories , with ties to the french royal house and to the german emperors . [SEP]
[CLS] contemporary writers considered the marriage , which produced four sons and five or six daughters , to be a success . [SEP]
[CLS] no authentic portrait of william has been found ; the contemporary depictions of him on the bay ##eux tapestry and on his seals and coins are conventional representations designed to assert his authority . [SEP]
[CLS] there are some written descriptions of a bu ##rly and robust appearance , with a gut ##tura ##l voice . [SEP]
[CLS] he enjoyed excellent health until old age , although he became quite fat in later life . [SEP]
[CLS] he was strong enough to draw bows that others were unable to pull and had great st ##amina . [SEP]
[CLS] geoffrey mart ##el described him as without equal as a fighter and as a horse ##man . [SEP]
[CLS] examination of william ' s fe ##mur , the only bone to survive when the rest of his remains were destroyed , showed he was approximately 5 ft in height . [SEP]
[CLS] there are records of two tutor ##s for the young duke during the late 103 ##0s and early 104 ##0s , but the extent of william ' s literary education is unclear . [SEP]
[CLS] he was not known as a patron of authors , and there is little evidence that he sponsored scholarship or other intellectual activities . [SEP]
[CLS] order ##ic vital ##is records that william tried to learn to read old english late in life , but he was unable to devote sufficient time to the effort and quickly gave up . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s main hobby appears to have been hunting . [SEP]
[CLS] his marriage to matilda appears to have been quite affection ##ate , and there are no signs that he was un ##fa ##ith ##ful to her – unusual in a medieval monarch . [SEP]
[CLS] medieval writers criticised william for his greed and cruelty , but his personal pie ##ty was universally praised by contemporaries . [SEP]
[CLS] norman government under william was similar to the government that had existed under earlier dukes . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a fairly simple administrative system , built around the duc ##al household , which consisted of a group of officers including steward ##s , butler ##s , and marshall ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the duke travelled constantly around the duchy , confirming charters and collecting revenues . [SEP]
[CLS] most of the income came from the duc ##al lands , as well as from toll ##s and a few taxes . [SEP]
[CLS] this income was collected by the chamber , one of the household departments . [SEP]
[CLS] william cultivated close relations with the church in his duchy . [SEP]
[CLS] he took part in church councils and made several appointments to the norman ep ##is ##co ##pate , including the appointment of ma ##uri ##lius as archbishop of rouen . [SEP]
[CLS] another important appointment was that of william ' s half - brother o ##do as bishop of bay ##eux in either 104 ##9 or 105 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] he also relied on the clergy for advice , including lan ##fra ##nc , a non - norman who rose to become one of william ' s prominent ecclesiastical advisors in the late 104 ##0s and remained so throughout the 105 ##0s and 106 ##0s . [SEP]
[CLS] william gave generous ##ly to the church ; from 103 ##5 to 106 ##6 , the norman aristocracy founded at least 20 new monastic houses , including william ' s 2 monasteries in ca ##en , a remarkable expansion of religious life in the duchy . [SEP]
[CLS] in 105 ##1 the childless king edward of england appears to have chosen william as his successor to the english throne . [SEP]
[CLS] william was the grandson of edward ' s maternal uncle , richard ii , duke of normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] the " anglo - saxon chronicle " , in the " d " version , states that william visited england in the later part of 105 ##1 , perhaps to secure confirmation of the succession , or perhaps william was attempting to secure aid for his troubles in normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] the trip is unlikely given william ' s absorption in warfare with an ##jou at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] whatever edward ' s wishes , it was likely that any claim by william would be opposed by god ##win , the earl of wessex , a member of the most powerful family in england . [SEP]
[CLS] edward had married edith , god ##win ' s daughter , in 104 ##3 , and god ##win appears to have been one of the main supporters of edward ' s claim to the throne . [SEP]
[CLS] by 105 ##0 , however , relations between the king and the earl had sour ##ed , culminating in a crisis in 105 ##1 that led to the exile of god ##win and his family from england . [SEP]
[CLS] it was during this exile that edward offered the throne to william . [SEP]
[CLS] god ##win returned from exile in 105 ##2 with armed forces , and a settlement was reached between the king and the earl , restoring the earl and his family to their lands and replacing robert of ju ##mie ##ges , a norman whom edward had named archbishop of canterbury , with st ##igan ##d , the bishop of winchester . [SEP]
[CLS] no english source mentions a supposed embassy by archbishop robert to william convey ##ing the promise of the succession , and the two norman sources that mention it , william of ju ##mie ##ges and william of po ##iti ##ers , are not precise in their chronology of when this visit took place . [SEP]
[CLS] count herbert ii of maine died in 106 ##2 , and william , who had bet ##rot ##hed his eldest son robert to herbert ' s sister margaret , claimed the county through his son . [SEP]
[CLS] local nobles resisted the claim , but william invaded and by 106 ##4 had secured control of the area . [SEP]
[CLS] william appointed a norman to the bishopric of le mans in 106 ##5 . [SEP]
[CLS] he also allowed his son robert curt ##hos ##e to do homage to the new count of an ##jou , geoffrey the bearded . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s western border was thus secured , but his border with brittany remained ins ##ecure . [SEP]
[CLS] in 106 ##4 william invaded brittany in a campaign that remains obscure in its details . [SEP]
[CLS] its effect , though , was to des ##ta ##bilis ##e brittany , forcing the duke , conan ii , to focus on internal problems rather than on expansion . [SEP]
[CLS] conan ' s death in 106 ##6 further secured william ' s borders in normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] william also benefited from his campaign in brittany by securing the support of some breton nobles who went on to support the invasion of england in 106 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] in england , earl god ##win died in 105 ##3 and his sons were increasing in power : harold succeeded to his father ' s earl ##dom , and another son , to ##sti ##g , became earl of north ##umb ##ria . [SEP]
[CLS] other sons were granted earl ##dom ##s later : g ##yr ##th as earl of east anglia in 105 ##7 and leo ##f ##wine as earl of kent some time between 105 ##5 and 105 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] some sources claim that harold took part in william ' s breton campaign of 106 ##4 and that harold swore to uphold william ' s claim to the english throne at the end of the campaign , but no english source reports this trip , and it is unclear if it actually occurred . [SEP]
[CLS] it may have been norman propaganda designed to disc ##red ##it harold , who had emerged as the main contender to succeed king edward . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , another contender for the throne had emerged – edward the exile , son of edmund iron ##side and a grandson of æ ##the ##lr ##ed ii , returned to england in 105 ##7 , and although he died shortly after his return , he brought with him his family , which included two daughters , margaret and christina , and a son , edgar the æ ##the ##ling . [SEP]
[CLS] in 106 ##5 north ##umb ##ria revolt ##ed against to ##sti ##g , and the rebels chose mor ##car , the younger brother of edwin , earl of mer ##cia , as earl in place of to ##sti ##g . [SEP]
[CLS] harold , perhaps to secure the support of edwin and mor ##car in his bid for the throne , supported the rebels and persuaded king edward to replace to ##sti ##g with mor ##car . [SEP]
[CLS] to ##sti ##g went into exile in flanders , along with his wife judith , who was the daughter of count baldwin iv of flanders . [SEP]
[CLS] edward was ai ##ling , and he died on 5 january 106 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] it is unclear what exactly happened at edward ' s death ##bed . [SEP]
[CLS] one story , der ##iving from the " vita edward ##i " , a biography of edward , claims that edward was attended by his wife edith , harold , archbishop st ##igan ##d , and robert fitz ##wi ##mar ##c , and that the king named harold as his successor . [SEP]
[CLS] the norman sources do not dispute the fact that harold was named as the next king , but they declare that harold ' s oath and edward ' s earlier promise of the throne could not be changed on edward ' s death ##bed . [SEP]
[CLS] later english sources stated that harold had been elected as king by the clergy and magnate ##s of england . [SEP]
[CLS] harold was crowned on 6 january 106 ##6 in edward ' s new norman - style westminster abbey , although some controversy surrounds who performed the ceremony . [SEP]
[CLS] english sources claim that ea ##ld ##red , the archbishop of york , performed the ceremony , while norman sources state that the coronation was performed by st ##igan ##d , who was considered a non - canonical archbishop by the papacy . [SEP]
[CLS] harold ' s claim to the throne was not entirely secure , however , as there were other claim ##ants , perhaps including his exiled brother to ##sti ##g . [SEP]
[CLS] king harald hard ##rada of norway also had a claim to the throne as the uncle and heir of king magnus i , who had made a pact with hart ##ha ##c ##nut in about 104 ##0 that if either magnus or hart ##ha ##c ##nut died without heirs , the other would succeed . [SEP]
[CLS] the last claim ##ant was william of normandy , against whose anticipated invasion king harold god ##win ##son made most of his preparations . [SEP]
[CLS] harold ' s brother to ##sti ##g made probing attacks along the southern coast of england in may 106 ##6 , landing at the isle of wight using a fleet supplied by baldwin of flanders . [SEP]
[CLS] to ##sti ##g appears to have received little local support , and further raids into lincolnshire and near the river hum ##ber met with no more success , so he retreated to scotland , where he remained for a time . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the norman writer william of ju ##mie ##ges , william had meanwhile sent an embassy to king harold god ##win ##son to remind harold of his oath to support william ' s claim , although whether this embassy actually occurred is unclear . [SEP]
[CLS] harold assembled an army and a fleet to rep ##el william ' s anticipated invasion force , deploy ##ing troops and ships along the english channel for most of the summer . [SEP]
[CLS] william of po ##iti ##ers describes a council called by duke william , in which the writer gives an account of a great debate that took place between william ' s nobles and supporters over whether to risk an invasion of england . [SEP]
[CLS] although some sort of formal assembly probably was held , it is unlikely that any debate took place , as the duke had by then established control over his nobles , and most of those assembled would have been anxious to secure their share of the rewards from the conquest of england . [SEP]
[CLS] william of po ##iti ##ers also relates that the duke obtained the consent of pope alexander ii for the invasion , along with a papal banner . [SEP]
[CLS] the chronicle ##r also claimed that the duke secured the support of holy roman emperor henry iv and king sw ##ey ##n ii of denmark . [SEP]
[CLS] henry was still a minor , however , and sw ##ey ##n was more likely to support harold , who could then help sw ##ey ##n against the norwegian king , so these claims should be treated with caution . [SEP]
[CLS] although alexander did give papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded , no other source claims papal support prior to the invasion . [SEP]
[CLS] events after the invasion , which included the pena ##nce william performed and statements by later pope ##s , do lend ci ##rc ##ums ##tan ##tial support to the claim of papal approval . [SEP]
[CLS] to deal with norman affairs , william put the government of normandy into the hands of his wife for the duration of the invasion . [SEP]
[CLS] throughout the summer , william assembled an army and an invasion fleet in normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] although william of ju ##mie ##ges ' s claim that the duc ##al fleet numbered 3 , 000 ships is clearly an ex ##agger ##ation , it was probably large and mostly built from scratch . [SEP]
[CLS] although william of po ##iti ##ers and william of ju ##mie ##ges disagree about where the fleet was built – po ##iti ##ers states it was constructed at the mouth of the river dive ##s , while ju ##mie ##ges states it was built at saint - vale ##ry - sur - somme – both agree that it eventually sailed from vale ##ry - sur - somme . [SEP]
[CLS] the fleet carried an invasion force that included , in addition to troops from william ' s own territories of normandy and maine , large numbers of mercenaries , allies , and volunteers from brittany , northeastern france , and flanders , together with smaller numbers from other parts of europe . [SEP]
[CLS] although the army and fleet were ready by early august , adverse winds kept the ships in normandy until late september . [SEP]
[CLS] there were probably other reasons for william ' s delay , including intelligence reports from england revealing that harold ' s forces were deployed along the coast . [SEP]
[CLS] william would have preferred to delay the invasion until he could make an unopposed landing . [SEP]
[CLS] harold kept his forces on alert throughout the summer , but with the arrival of the harvest season he disbanded his army on 8 september . [SEP]
[CLS] harold ' s brother to ##sti ##g and harald hard ##rada invaded north ##umb ##ria in september 106 ##6 and defeated the local forces under mor ##car and edwin at the battle of fu ##lford near york . [SEP]
[CLS] king harold received word of their invasion and marched north , defeating the invaders and killing to ##sti ##g and hard ##rada on 25 september at the battle of stamford bridge . [SEP]
[CLS] the norman fleet finally set sail two days later , landing in england at pe ##ven ##sey bay on 28 september . [SEP]
[CLS] william then moved to hastings , a few miles to the east , where he built a castle as a base of operations . [SEP]
[CLS] from there , he ravaged the interior and waited for harold ' s return from the north , refusing to venture far from the sea , his line of communication with normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] after defeating harald hard ##rada and to ##sti ##g , harold left much of his army in the north , including mor ##car and edwin , and marched the rest south to deal with the threatened norman invasion . [SEP]
[CLS] he probably learned of william ' s landing while he was travelling south . [SEP]
[CLS] harold stopped in london , and was there for about a week before marching to hastings , so it is likely that he spent about a week on his march south , averaging about 27 mi per day , for the distance of approximately 200 mi . [SEP]
[CLS] although harold attempted to surprise the norman ##s , william ' s scouts reported the english arrival to the duke . [SEP]
[CLS] the exact events preceding the battle are obscure , with contradictory accounts in the sources , but all agree that william led his army from his castle and advanced towards the enemy . [SEP]
[CLS] harold had taken a defensive position at the top of sen ##la ##c hill ( present - day battle , east sussex ) , about 6 mi from william ' s castle at hastings . [SEP]
[CLS] the battle began at about 9 am on 14 october and lasted all day , but while a broad outline is known , the exact events are obscured by contradictory accounts in the sources . [SEP]
[CLS] although the numbers on each side were about equal , william had both cavalry and infantry , including many archers , while harold had only foot soldiers and few , if any , archers . [SEP]
[CLS] the english soldiers formed up as a shield wall along the ridge and were at first so effective that william ' s army was thrown back with heavy casualties . [SEP]
[CLS] some of william ' s breton troops panicked and fled , and some of the english troops appear to have pursued the fleeing breton ##s until they themselves were attacked and destroyed by norman cavalry . [SEP]
[CLS] during the breton ##s ' flight , rumours swept through the norman forces that the duke had been killed , but william succeeded in rally ##ing his troops . [SEP]
[CLS] two further norman retreat ##s were fei ##gned , to once again draw the english into pursuit and expose them to repeated attacks by the norman cavalry . [SEP]
[CLS] the available sources are more confused about events in the afternoon , but it appears that the decisive event was harold ' s death , about which differing stories are told . [SEP]
[CLS] william of ju ##mie ##ges claimed that harold was killed by the duke . [SEP]
[CLS] the bay ##eux tapestry has been claimed to show harold ' s death by an arrow to the eye , but that may be a later re ##working of the tapestry to conform to 12th - century stories in which harold was slain by an arrow wound to the head . [SEP]
[CLS] harold ' s body was identified the day after the battle , either through his armour or marks on his body . [SEP]
[CLS] the english dead , who included some of harold ' s brothers and his house ##car ##ls , were left on the battlefield . [SEP]
[CLS] g ##yt ##ha , harold ' s mother , offered the victorious duke the weight of her son ' s body in gold for its custody , but her offer was refused . [SEP]
[CLS] william ordered that harold ' s body was to be thrown into the sea , but whether that took place is unclear . [SEP]
[CLS] walt ##ham abbey , which had been founded by harold , later claimed that his body had been secretly buried there . [SEP]
[CLS] william may have hoped the english would surrender following his victory , but they did not . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , some of the english clergy and magnate ##s nominated edgar the æ ##the ##ling as king , though their support for edgar was only luke ##war ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] after waiting a short while , william secured dover , parts of kent , and canterbury , while also sending a force to capture winchester , where the royal treasury was . [SEP]
[CLS] these captures secured william ' s rear areas and also his line of retreat to normandy , if that was needed . [SEP]
[CLS] william then marched to south ##wark , across the thames from london , which he reached in late november . [SEP]
[CLS] next he led his forces around the south and west of london , burning along the way . [SEP]
[CLS] he finally crossed the thames at wall ##ing ##ford in early december . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##igan ##d submitted to william there , and when the duke moved on to be ##rk ##ham ##sted soon afterwards , edgar the æ ##the ##ling , mor ##car , edwin , and ea ##ld ##red also submitted . [SEP]
[CLS] william then sent forces into london to construct a castle ; he was crowned at westminster abbey on christmas day 106 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] william remained in england after his coronation and tried to reconcile the native magnate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the remaining earls – edwin ( of mer ##cia ) , mor ##car ( of north ##umb ##ria ) , and walt ##he ##of ( of northampton ) – were confirmed in their lands and titles . [SEP]
[CLS] walt ##he ##of was married to william ' s niece judith , daughter of adelaide , and a marriage between edwin and one of william ' s daughters was proposed . [SEP]
[CLS] edgar the æ ##the ##ling also appears to have been given lands . [SEP]
[CLS] ecclesiastical offices continued to be held by the same bishops as before the invasion , including the un ##cano ##nical st ##igan ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] but the families of harold and his brothers lost their lands , as did some others who had fought against william at hastings . [SEP]
[CLS] by march , william was secure enough to return to normandy , but he took with him st ##igan ##d , mor ##car , edwin , edgar , and walt ##he ##of . [SEP]
[CLS] he left his half - brother o ##do , the bishop of bay ##eux , in charge of england along with another influential supporter , william fitz ##os ##ber ##n , the son of his former guardian . [SEP]
[CLS] both men were also named to earl ##dom ##s – fitz ##os ##ber ##n to hereford ( or wessex ) and o ##do to kent . [SEP]
[CLS] although he put two norman ##s in overall charge , he retained many of the native english sheriff ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] once in normandy the new english king went to rouen and the abbey of fe ##camp , and then attended the consecration of new churches at two norman monasteries . [SEP]
[CLS] while william was in normandy , a former ally , eu ##sta ##ce , the count of bo ##ulo ##gne , invaded at dover but was repulsed . [SEP]
[CLS] english resistance had also begun , with ea ##dr ##ic the wild attacking hereford and revolt ##s at exeter , where harold ' s mother g ##yt ##ha was a focus of resistance . [SEP]
[CLS] fitz ##os ##ber ##n and o ##do found it difficult to control the native population and undertook a programme of castle building to maintain their hold on the kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] william returned to england in december 106 ##7 and marched on exeter , which he besieged . [SEP]
[CLS] the town held out for 18 days , and after it fell to william he built a castle to secure his control . [SEP]
[CLS] harold ' s sons were meanwhile raiding the southwest of england from a base in ireland . [SEP]
[CLS] their forces landed near bristol but were defeated by ea ##d ##not ##h . [SEP]
[CLS] by easter , william was at winchester , where he was soon joined by his wife matilda , who was crowned in may 106 ##8 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 106 ##8 edwin and mor ##car revolt ##ed , supported by go ##sp ##at ##ric . [SEP]
[CLS] the chronicle ##r order ##ic vital ##is states that edwin ' s reason for revolt ##ing was that the proposed marriage between himself and one of william ' s daughters had not taken place , but another reason probably included the increasing power of william fitz ##os ##ber ##n in hereford ##shire , which affected edwin ' s power within his own earl ##dom . [SEP]
[CLS] the king marched through edwin ' s lands and built a castle at warwick . [SEP]
[CLS] edwin and mor ##car submitted , but william continued on to york , building castles at york and nottingham before returning south . [SEP]
[CLS] on his southbound journey , the king began constructing castles at lincoln , hunting ##don , and cambridge . [SEP]
[CLS] william placed supporters in charge of these new fortifications – among them william pe ##vere ##l at nottingham and henry de beaumont at warwick . [SEP]
[CLS] then the king returned to normandy late in 106 ##8 . [SEP]
[CLS] early in 106 ##9 , edgar the æ ##the ##ling rose in revolt and attacked york . [SEP]
[CLS] although william returned to york and built another castle , edgar remained free , and in the autumn he joined up with king sw ##ey ##n of denmark . [SEP]
[CLS] the danish king had brought a large fleet to england and attacked not only york but exeter and shrewsbury . [SEP]
[CLS] york was captured by the combined forces of edgar and sw ##ey ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] edgar was proclaimed king by his supporters , but william responded swiftly , ignoring a continental revolt in maine . [SEP]
[CLS] william symbolic ##ally wore his crown in the ruins of york on christmas day 106 ##9 , and then proceeded to buy off the danes . [SEP]
[CLS] he marched to the river tee ##s , ra ##va ##ging the countryside as he went . [SEP]
[CLS] edgar , having lost much of his support , fled to scotland , where king malcolm iii was married to edgar ' s sister margaret . [SEP]
[CLS] walt ##he ##of , who had joined the revolt , submitted , along with go ##sp ##at ##ric , and both were allowed to retain their lands . [SEP]
[CLS] but william was not finished ; he marched over the penn ##ines during the winter and defeated the remaining rebels at shrewsbury before building castles at chester and stafford . [SEP]
[CLS] this campaign , which included the burning and destruction of part of the countryside that the royal forces marched through , is usually known as the " harry ##ing of the north " ; it was over by april 107 ##0 , when william wore his crown ceremonial ##ly for easter at winchester . [SEP]
[CLS] while at winchester in 107 ##0 , william met with three papal leg ##ates – john min ##utus , peter , and er ##men ##frid of si ##on – who had been sent by the pope . [SEP]
[CLS] the leg ##ates ceremonial ##ly crowned william during the easter court . [SEP]
[CLS] the historian david bates sees this coronation as the ceremonial papal " seal of approval " for william ' s conquest . [SEP]
[CLS] the leg ##ates and the king then proceeded to hold a series of ecclesiastical councils dedicated to reforming and re ##org ##ani ##sing the english church . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##igan ##d and his brother , æ ##the ##lm ##æ ##r , the bishop of elm ##ham , were deposed from their bishopric ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the native abbot ##s were also deposed , both at the council held near easter and at a further one near w ##hit ##sun . [SEP]
[CLS] the w ##hit ##sun council saw the appointment of lan ##fra ##nc as the new archbishop of canterbury , and thomas of bay ##eux as the new archbishop of york , to replace ea ##ld ##red , who had died in september 106 ##9 . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s half - brother o ##do perhaps expected to be appointed to canterbury , but william probably did not wish to give that much power to a family member . [SEP]
[CLS] another reason for the appointment may have been pressure from the papacy to appoint lan ##fra ##nc . [SEP]
[CLS] norman clergy were appointed to replace the deposed bishops and abbot ##s , and at the end of the process , only two native english bishops remained in office , along with several continental prelate ##s appointed by edward the confess ##or . [SEP]
[CLS] in 107 ##0 william also founded battle abbey , a new monastery at the site of the battle of hastings , partly as a pena ##nce for the deaths in the battle and partly as a memorial to the dead . [SEP]
[CLS] at an ec ##cles ##ia ##tical council held in lille ##bon ##ne in 108 ##0 , william was confirmed in his ultimate authority over the norman church . [SEP]
[CLS] although sw ##ey ##n had promised to leave england , he returned in spring 107 ##0 , raiding along the hum ##ber and east anglia toward the isle of ely , where he joined up with here ##ward the wake , a local the ##gn . [SEP]
[CLS] here ##ward ' s forces attacked peterborough abbey , which they captured and looted . [SEP]
[CLS] william was able to secure the departure of sw ##ey ##n and his fleet in 107 ##0 , allowing him to return to the continent to deal with troubles in maine , where the town of le mans had revolt ##ed in 106 ##9 . [SEP]
[CLS] another concern was the death of count baldwin vi of flanders in july 107 ##0 , which led to a succession crisis as his widow , rich ##ilde , was ruling for their two young sons , ar ##nu ##lf and baldwin . [SEP]
[CLS] her rule , however , was contested by robert , baldwin ' s brother . [SEP]
[CLS] rich ##ilde proposed marriage to william fitz ##os ##ber ##n , who was in normandy , and fitz ##os ##ber ##n accepted . [SEP]
[CLS] but after he was killed in february 107 ##1 at the battle of cass ##el , robert became count . [SEP]
[CLS] he was opposed to king william ' s power on the continent , thus the battle of cass ##el upset the balance of power in northern france in addition to costing william an important supporter . [SEP]
[CLS] in 107 ##1 william defeated the last rebellion of the north . [SEP]
[CLS] earl edwin was betrayed by his own men and killed , while william built a causeway to sub ##due the isle of ely , where here ##ward the wake and mor ##car were hiding . [SEP]
[CLS] here ##ward escaped , but mor ##car was captured , deprived of his earl ##dom , and imprisoned . [SEP]
[CLS] in 107 ##2 william invaded scotland , defeating malcolm , who had recently invaded the north of england . [SEP]
[CLS] william and malcolm agreed to peace by signing the treaty of abe ##rnet ##hy , and malcolm probably gave up his son duncan as a hostage for the peace . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps another st ##ip ##ulation of the treaty was the expulsion of edgar the æ ##the ##ling from malcolm ' s court . [SEP]
[CLS] william then turned his attention to the continent , returning to normandy in early 107 ##3 to deal with the invasion of maine by fu ##lk le rec ##hin , the count of an ##jou . [SEP]
[CLS] with a swift campaign , william seized le mans from fu ##lk ' s forces , completing the campaign by 30 march 107 ##3 . [SEP]
[CLS] this made william ' s power more secure in northern france , but the new count of flanders accepted edgar the æ ##the ##ling into his court . [SEP]
[CLS] robert also married his half - sister bertha to the king of france , philip i , who was opposed to norman power . [SEP]
[CLS] william returned to england to release his army from service in 107 ##3 but quickly returned to normandy , where he spent all of 107 ##4 . [SEP]
[CLS] he left england in the hands of his supporters , including richard fitz ##gil ##bert and william de ware ##nne , as well as lan ##fra ##nc . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s ability to leave england for an entire year was a sign that he felt that his control of the kingdom was secure . [SEP]
[CLS] while william was in normandy , edgar the æ ##the ##ling returned to scotland from flanders . [SEP]
[CLS] the french king , seeking a focus for those opposed to william ' s power , then proposed that edgar be given the castle of mont ##re ##uil - sur - mer on the channel , which would have given edgar a strategic advantage against william . [SEP]
[CLS] edgar was forced to submit to william shortly thereafter , however , and he returned to william ' s court . [SEP]
[CLS] philip , although thwarted in this attempt , turned his attention ##s to brittany , leading to a revolt in 107 ##5 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 107 ##5 , during william ' s absence , ralph de gael , the earl of norfolk , and roger de bret ##eu ##il , the earl of hereford , con ##sp ##ired to overthrow william in the " revolt of the earls " . [SEP]
[CLS] ralph was at least part breton and had spent most of his life prior to 106 ##6 in brittany , where he still had lands . [SEP]
[CLS] roger was a norman , son of william fitz ##os ##ber ##n , but had inherited less authority than his father held . [SEP]
[CLS] ralph ' s authority seems also to have been less than his predecessors in the earl ##dom , and this was likely the cause of his involvement in the revolt . [SEP]
[CLS] the exact reason for the rebellion is unclear , but it was launched at the wedding of ralph to a relative of roger , held at ex ##ning in suffolk . [SEP]
[CLS] another earl , walt ##he ##of , the earl of north ##umb ##ria , although one of william ' s favourites , was also involved , and there were some breton lords who were ready to rebel in support of ralph and roger . [SEP]
[CLS] ralph also requested danish aid . [SEP]
[CLS] william remained in normandy while his men in england subdued the revolt . [SEP]
[CLS] roger was unable to leave his stronghold in hereford ##shire because of efforts by wu ##lf ##stan , the bishop of worcester , and æ ##the ##l ##wig , the abbot of eve ##sham . [SEP]
[CLS] ralph was bottled up in norwich castle by the combined efforts of o ##do of bay ##eux , geoffrey de mont ##bra ##y , richard fitz ##gil ##bert , and william de ware ##nne . [SEP]
[CLS] ralph eventually left norwich in the control of his wife and left england , finally ending up in brittany . [SEP]
[CLS] norwich was besieged and surrendered , with the garrison allowed to go to brittany . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , the danish king ' s brother , cn ##ut , had finally arrived in england with a fleet of 200 ships , but he was too late as norwich had already surrendered . [SEP]
[CLS] the danes then raided along the coast before returning home . [SEP]
[CLS] william returned to england later in 107 ##5 to deal with the danish threat , leaving his wife matilda in charge of normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] he celebrated christmas at winchester and dealt with the aftermath of the rebellion . [SEP]
[CLS] roger and walt ##he ##of were kept in prison , where walt ##he ##of was executed in may 107 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] before this , william had returned to the continent , where ralph had continued the rebellion from brittany . [SEP]
[CLS] earl ralph had secured control of the castle at do ##l , and in september 107 ##6 william advanced into brittany and laid siege to the castle . [SEP]
[CLS] king philip of france later relieved the siege and defeated william at the battle of do ##l , forcing him to retreat back to normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] although this was william ' s first defeat in battle , it did little to change things . [SEP]
[CLS] an ang ##ev ##in attack on maine was defeated in late 107 ##6 or 107 ##7 , with count fu ##lk le rec ##hin wounded in the unsuccessful attack . [SEP]
[CLS] more serious was the retirement of simon de cr ##ep ##y , the count of ami ##ens , to a monastery . [SEP]
[CLS] before he became a monk , simon handed his county of the ve ##xin over to king philip . [SEP]
[CLS] the ve ##xin was a buffer state between normandy and the lands of the french king , and simon had been a supporter of william . [SEP]
[CLS] william was able to make peace with philip in 107 ##7 and secured a truce with count fu ##lk in late 107 ##7 or early 107 ##8 . [SEP]
[CLS] in late 107 ##7 or early 107 ##8 trouble began between william and his eldest son , robert . [SEP]
[CLS] although order ##ic vital ##is describes it as starting with a quarrel between robert and his two younger brothers , william and henry , including a story that the quarrel was started when william and henry threw water at robert , it is much more likely that robert was feeling powerless . [SEP]
[CLS] order ##ic relates that he had previously demanded control of maine and normandy and had been re ##bu ##ffed . [SEP]
[CLS] the trouble in 107 ##7 or 107 ##8 resulted in robert leaving normandy accompanied by a band of young men , many of them the sons of william ' s supporters . [SEP]
[CLS] included among them was robert of belle ##me , william de bret ##eu ##il , and roger , the son of richard fitz ##gil ##bert . [SEP]
[CLS] this band of young men went to the castle at re ##mal ##ard , where they proceeded to raid into normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] the raiders were supported by many of william ' s continental enemies . [SEP]
[CLS] william immediately attacked the rebels and drove them from re ##mal ##ard , but king philip gave them the castle at ge ##rber ##oi , where they were joined by new supporters . [SEP]
[CLS] william then laid siege to ge ##rber ##oi in january 107 ##9 . [SEP]
[CLS] after three weeks , the besieged forces sal ##lie ##d from the castle and managed to take the be ##sie ##gers by surprise . [SEP]
[CLS] william was un ##horse ##d by robert and was only saved from death by an englishman , to ##ki son of wig ##od , who was himself killed . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s forces were forced to lift the siege , and the king returned to rouen . [SEP]
[CLS] by 12 april 108 ##0 , william and robert had reached an accommodation , with william once more af ##firm ##ing that robert would receive normandy when he died . [SEP]
[CLS] word of william ' s defeat at ge ##rber ##oi stirred up difficulties in northern england . [SEP]
[CLS] in august and september 107 ##9 king malcolm of scots raided south of the river tweed , devastating the land between the river tee ##s and the tweed in a raid that lasted almost a month . [SEP]
[CLS] the lack of norman response appears to have caused the north ##umb ##rians to grow rest ##ive , and in the spring of 108 ##0 they rebelled against the rule of wal ##cher , the bishop of durham and earl of north ##umb ##ria . [SEP]
[CLS] the bishop was killed on 14 may 108 ##0 , and william dispatched his half - brother o ##do to deal with the rebellion . [SEP]
[CLS] william departed normandy in july 108 ##0 , and in the autumn william ' s son robert was sent on a campaign against the scots . [SEP]
[CLS] robert raided into lot ##hian and forced malcolm to agree to terms , building a fortification at newcastle - on - tyne while returning to england . [SEP]
[CLS] the king was at gloucester for christmas 108 ##0 and at winchester for w ##hit ##sun in 108 ##1 , ceremonial ##ly wearing his crown on both occasions . [SEP]
[CLS] a papal embassy arrived in england during this period , asking that william do fe ##al ##ty for england to the papacy , a request that william rejected . [SEP]
[CLS] william also visited wales during 108 ##1 , although the english and the welsh sources differ on the exact purpose of the visit . [SEP]
[CLS] the " anglo - saxon chronicle " states that it was a military campaign , but welsh sources record it as a pilgrimage to st david ##s in honour of saint david . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s biographer david bates argues that the former explanation is more likely , explaining that the balance of power had recently shifted in wales and that william would have wished to take advantage of the changed circumstances to extend norman power . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of 108 ##1 , william was back on the continent , dealing with disturbances in maine . [SEP]
[CLS] although he led an expedition into maine , the result was instead a negotiated settlement arranged by a papal leg ##ate . [SEP]
[CLS] sources for william ' s actions between 108 ##2 and 108 ##4 are me ##ag ##re . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the historian david bates , this probably means that little happened of note , and that because william was on the continent , there was nothing for the " anglo - saxon chronicle " to record . [SEP]
[CLS] in 108 ##2 william ordered the arrest of his half - brother o ##do . [SEP]
[CLS] the exact reasons are unclear , as no contemporary author recorded what caused the quarrel between the half - brothers . [SEP]
[CLS] order ##ic vital ##is later recorded that o ##do had aspirations to become pope . [SEP]
[CLS] order ##ic also related that o ##do had attempted to persuade some of william ' s vassal ##s to join o ##do on an invasion of southern italy . [SEP]
[CLS] this would have been considered tam ##per ##ing with the king ' s authority over his vassal ##s , which william would not have tolerated . [SEP]
[CLS] although o ##do remained in confinement for the rest of william ' s reign , his lands were not confiscated . [SEP]
[CLS] more difficulties struck in 108 ##3 , when william ' s eldest son robert rebelled once more with support from the french king . [SEP]
[CLS] a further blow was the death of matilda , william ' s wife , on 2 november 108 ##3 . [SEP]
[CLS] william was always described as close to his wife , and her death would have added to his problems . [SEP]
[CLS] maine continued to be difficult , with a rebellion by hubert de beaumont - au - maine , probably in 108 ##4 . [SEP]
[CLS] hubert was besieged in his castle at sainte - suzanne by william ' s forces for at least two years , but he eventually made his peace with the king and was restored to favour . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s movements during 108 ##4 and 108 ##5 are unclear – he was in normandy at easter 108 ##4 but may have been in england before then to collect the dane ##gel ##d assessed that year for the defence of england against an invasion by king cn ##ut iv of denmark . [SEP]
[CLS] although english and norman forces remained on alert throughout 108 ##5 and into 1086 , the invasion threat was ended by cn ##ut ' s death in july 1086 . [SEP]
[CLS] as part of his efforts to secure england , william ordered many castles , keeps , and mo ##ttes built – among them the central keep of the tower of london , the white tower . [SEP]
[CLS] these fortifications allowed norman ##s to retreat into safety when threatened with rebellion and allowed garrison ##s to be protected while they occupied the countryside . [SEP]
[CLS] the early castles were simple earth and timber constructions , later replaced with stone structures . [SEP]
[CLS] at first , most of the newly settled norman ##s kept household knights and did not settle their retain ##ers with fi ##ef ##s of their own , but gradually these household knights came to be granted lands of their own , a process known as sub ##in ##fe ##uda ##tion . [SEP]
[CLS] william also required his newly created magnate ##s to contribute fixed quota ##s of knights towards not only military campaigns but also castle garrison ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this method of organising the military forces was a departure from the pre - conquest english practice of basin ##g military service on territorial units such as the hide . [SEP]
[CLS] by william ' s death , after weather ##ing a series of rebellion ##s , most of the native anglo - saxon aristocracy had been replaced by norman and other continental magnate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] not all of the norman ##s who accompanied william in the initial conquest acquired large amounts of land in england . [SEP]
[CLS] some appear to have been reluctant to take up lands in a kingdom that did not always appear pac ##ified . [SEP]
[CLS] although some of the newly rich norman ##s in england came from william ' s close family or from the upper norman nobility , others were from relatively humble backgrounds . [SEP]
[CLS] william granted some lands to his continental followers from the holdings of one or more specific english ##men ; at other times , he granted a compact grouping of lands previously held by many different english ##men to one norman follower , often to allow for the consolidation of lands around a strategically placed castle . [SEP]
[CLS] the medieval chronicle ##r william of mal ##mes ##bury says that the king also seized and de ##pop ##ulated many miles of land ( 36 parishes ) , turning it into the royal new forest region to support his enthusiastic enjoyment of hunting . [SEP]
[CLS] modern historians have come to the conclusion that the new forest de ##pop ##ulation was greatly exaggerated . [SEP]
[CLS] most of the lands of the new forest are poor agricultural lands , and archaeological and geographic studies have shown that the new forest was likely sparsely settled when it was turned into a royal forest . [SEP]
[CLS] william was known for his love of hunting , and he introduced the forest law into areas of the country , regulating who could hunt and what could be hunted . [SEP]
[CLS] after 106 ##6 , william did not attempt to integrate his separate domains into one unified realm with one set of laws . [SEP]
[CLS] his seal from after 106 ##6 , of which six impressions still survive , was made for him after he conquered england and stressed his role as king , while separately mentioning his role as duke . [SEP]
[CLS] when in normandy , william acknowledged that he owed fe ##al ##ty to the french king , but in england no such ac ##k ##now ##led ##gm ##ent was made – further evidence that the various parts of william ' s lands were considered separate . [SEP]
[CLS] the administrative machinery of normandy , england , and maine continued to exist separate from the other lands , with each one retaining its own forms . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , england continued the use of writ ##s , which were not known on the continent . [SEP]
[CLS] also , the charters and documents produced for the government in normandy differed in formulas from those produced in england . [SEP]
[CLS] william took over an english government that was more complex than the norman system . [SEP]
[CLS] england was divided into shire ##s or counties , which were further divided into either hundreds or wa ##pen ##take ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] each shire was administered by a royal official called a sheriff , who roughly had the same status as a norman viscount . [SEP]
[CLS] a sheriff was responsible for royal justice and collecting royal revenue . [SEP]
[CLS] to oversee his expanded domain , william was forced to travel even more than he had as duke . [SEP]
[CLS] he crossed back and forth between the continent and england at least 19 times between 106 ##7 and his death . [SEP]
[CLS] william spent most of his time in england between the battle of hastings and 107 ##2 , and after that , he spent the majority of his time in normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] government was still centred on william ' s household ; when he was in one part of his realms , decisions would be made for other parts of his domains and transmitted through a communication system that made use of letters and other documents . [SEP]
[CLS] william also appointed deputies who could make decisions while he was absent , especially if the absence was expected to be lengthy . [SEP]
[CLS] usually , this was a member of william ' s close family – frequently his half - brother o ##do or his wife matilda . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes deputies were appointed to deal with specific issues . [SEP]
[CLS] william continued the collection of dane ##gel ##d , a land tax . [SEP]
[CLS] this was an advantage for william , as it was the only universal tax collected by western european rulers during this period . [SEP]
[CLS] it was an annual tax based on the value of land ##holding ##s , and it could be collected at differing rates . [SEP]
[CLS] most years saw the rate of two shillings per hide , but in crises , it could be increased to as much as six shillings per hide . [SEP]
[CLS] coinage between the various parts of his domains continued to be mint ##ed in different cycles and styles . [SEP]
[CLS] english coins were generally of high silver content , with high artistic standards , and were required to be re - mint ##ed every three years . [SEP]
[CLS] norman coins had a much lower silver content , were often of poor artistic quality , and were rarely re - mint ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] also , in england , no other coinage was allowed , while on the continent other coinage was considered legal tender . [SEP]
[CLS] nor is there evidence that many english penn ##ies were circulating in normandy , which shows little attempt to integrate the monetary systems of england and normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] besides taxation , william ' s large land ##holding ##s throughout england strengthened his rule . [SEP]
[CLS] as king edward ' s heir , he controlled all of the former royal lands . [SEP]
[CLS] he also retained control of much of the lands of harold and his family , which made the king the largest secular landowner in england by a wide margin . [SEP]
[CLS] at christmas 108 ##5 , william ordered the compilation of a survey of the land ##holding ##s held by himself and by his vassal ##s throughout his kingdom , organised by counties . [SEP]
[CLS] it resulted in a work now known as the " domesday book " . [SEP]
[CLS] the listing for each county gives the holdings of each land ##holder , grouped by owners . [SEP]
[CLS] the listings describe the holding , who owned the land before the conquest , its value , what the tax assessment was , and usually the number of peasants , pl ##ough ##s , and any other resources the holding had . [SEP]
[CLS] towns were listed separately . [SEP]
[CLS] all the english counties south of the river tee ##s and river rib ##ble are included , and the whole work seems to have been mostly completed by 1 august 1086 , when the " anglo - saxon chronicle " records that william received the results and that all the chief magnate ##s swore the salisbury oath , a renewal of their oath ##s of allegiance . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s exact motivation in ordering the survey is unclear , but it probably had several purposes , such as making a record of feudal obligations and justify ##ing increased taxation . [SEP]
[CLS] william left england towards the end of 1086 . [SEP]
[CLS] following his arrival back on the continent he married his daughter constance to alan fe ##rgan ##t , the duke of brittany , in further ##ance of his policy of seeking allies against the french kings . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s son robert , still allied with the french king , appears to have been active in stirring up trouble , enough so that william led an expedition against the french ve ##xin in july 108 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] while seizing man ##tes , william either fell ill or was injured by the po ##mmel of his saddle . [SEP]
[CLS] he was taken to the priory of saint ge ##rva ##se at rouen , where he died on 9 september 108 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] knowledge of the events preceding his death is confused because there are two different accounts . [SEP]
[CLS] order ##ic vital ##is preserves a lengthy account , complete with speeches made by many of the principals , but this is likely more of an account of how a king should die than of what actually happened . [SEP]
[CLS] the other , the " de ob ##it ##u will ##el ##mi " , or " on the death of william " , has been shown to be a copy of two 9th - century accounts with names changed . [SEP]
[CLS] william left normandy to robert , and the custody of england was given to william ' s second surviving son , also called william , on the assumption that he would become king . [SEP]
[CLS] the youngest son , henry , received money . [SEP]
[CLS] after en ##trust ##ing england to his second son , the elder william sent the younger william back to england on 7 or 8 september , bearing a letter to lan ##fra ##nc ordering the archbishop to aid the new king . [SEP]
[CLS] other be ##quest ##s included gifts to the church and money to be distributed to the poor . [SEP]
[CLS] william also ordered that all of his prisoners be released , including his half - brother o ##do . [SEP]
[CLS] disorder followed william ' s death ; everyone who had been at his death ##bed left the body at rouen and hurried off to attend to their own affairs . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , the clergy of rouen arranged to have the body sent to ca ##en , where william had desired to be buried in his foundation of the ab ##bay ##e - aux - homme ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the funeral , attended by the bishops and abbot ##s of normandy as well as his son henry , was disturbed by the assertion of a citizen of ca ##en who alleged that his family had been illegally des ##po ##iled of the land on which the church was built . [SEP]
[CLS] after hurried consultation ##s , the all ##ega ##tion was shown to be true , and the man was compensated . [SEP]
[CLS] a further ind ##ign ##ity occurred when the corpse was lowered into the tomb . [SEP]
[CLS] the corpse was too large for the space , and when attendants forced the body into the tomb it burst , spreading a disgusting o ##dou ##r throughout the church . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s grave is currently marked by a marble slab with a latin inscription dating from the early 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] the tomb has been disturbed several times since 108 ##7 , the first time in 152 ##2 when the grave was opened on orders from the papacy . [SEP]
[CLS] the intact body was restored to the tomb at that time , but in 156 ##2 , during the french wars of religion , the grave was reopened and the bones scattered and lost , with the exception of one thigh bone . [SEP]
[CLS] this lone relic was re ##bu ##ried in 1642 with a new marker , which was replaced 100 years later with a more elaborate monument . [SEP]
[CLS] this tomb was again destroyed during the french revolution but was eventually replaced with the current marker . [SEP]
[CLS] the immediate consequence of william ' s death was a war between his sons robert and william over control of england and normandy . [SEP]
[CLS] even after the younger william ' s death in 1100 and the succession of his youngest brother henry as king , normandy and england remained contested between the brothers until robert ' s capture by henry at the battle of tin ##che ##bra ##y in 110 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] the difficulties over the succession led to a loss of authority in normandy , with the aristocracy regaining much of the power they had lost to the elder william . [SEP]
[CLS] his sons also lost much of their control over maine , which revolt ##ed in 108 ##9 and managed to remain mostly free of norman influence thereafter . [SEP]
[CLS] the impact on england of william ' s conquest was profound ; changes in the church , aristocracy , culture , and language of the country have persisted into modern times . [SEP]
[CLS] the conquest brought the kingdom into closer contact with france and forged ties between france and england that lasted throughout the middle ages . [SEP]
[CLS] another consequence of william ' s invasion was the sun ##der ##ing of the formerly close ties between england and scandinavia . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s government blended elements of the english and norman systems into a new one that laid the foundations of the later medieval english kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] how abrupt and far - reaching were the changes is still a matter of debate among historians , with some such as richard southern claiming that the conquest was the single most radical change in european history between the fall of rome and the 20th century . [SEP]
[CLS] others , such as h . g . richardson and g . o . say ##les , see the changes brought about by the conquest as much less radical than southern suggests . [SEP]
[CLS] the historian eleanor sea ##rle describes william ' s invasion as " a plan that no ruler but a scandinavian would have considered " . [SEP]
[CLS] william ' s reign has caused historical controversy since before his death . [SEP]
[CLS] william of po ##iti ##ers wrote glowing ##ly of william ' s reign and its benefits , but the obituary notice for william in the " anglo - saxon chronicle " condemn ##s william in harsh terms . [SEP]
[CLS] in the years since the conquest , politicians and other leaders have used william and the events of his reign to illustrate political events throughout english history . [SEP]
[CLS] during the reign of queen elizabeth i of england , archbishop matthew parker saw the conquest as having corrupted a pure ##r english church , which parker attempted to restore . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 17th and 18th centuries , some historians and lawyers saw william ' s reign as imposing a " norman yo ##ke " on the native anglo - saxons , an argument that continued during the 19th century with further el ##ab ##oration ##s along nationalist ##ic lines . [SEP]
[CLS] these various controversies have led to william being seen by some historians either as one of the creators of england ' s great ##ness or as in ##flict ##ing one of the greatest defeats in english history . [SEP]
[CLS] others have viewed william as an enemy of the english constitution , or alternatively as its creator . [SEP]
[CLS] william and his wife matilda of flanders had at least nine children . [SEP]
[CLS] the birth order of the sons is clear , but no source gives the relative order of birth of the daughters . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no evidence of any illegitimate children born to william . [SEP]
