The Rijksmuseum was founded in The Hague on 19 november 1798 and moved to Amsterdam in 1808, where it was first located in the Royal Palace and later in the Trippenhuis.
The current main building was designed by Pierre Cuypers and first opened in 1885.
On 13 April 2013, after a ten-year renovation which cost € 375 million, the main building was reopened by Queen Beatrix.
In 2013 and 2014, it was the most visited museum in the Netherlands with record numbers of 2.2 million and 2.47 million visitors.
It is also the largest art museum in the country.
The museum has on display 8,000 objects of art and history, from their total collection of 1 million objects from the years 1200–2000, among which are some masterpieces by Rembrandt, Frans Hals, and Johannes Vermeer.

On 31 May 1800, the National Art Gallery (Dutch: "Nationale Kunst-Galerij"), precursor of the Rijksmuseum, opened in Huis ten Bosch in The Hague.
The museum exhibited around 200 paintings and historic objects from the collections of the Dutch stadtholders.
In 1805, the National Art Gallery moved within The Hague to the Prince William V Gallery, on the Buitenhof.
On the orders of king Louis Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon, the museum moved to Amsterdam in 1808.
In 1809, the museum opened in the Royal Palace in Amsterdam.
In 1820, the historical objects were moved to the Mauritshuis in The Hague and in 1838, the 19th-century paintings ""of living masters"" were moved to King Louis Bonaparte's former summer palace Paviljoen Welgelegen in Haarlem.

In 1890, a new building was added a short distance to the south-west of the Rijksmuseum.
As the building was made out of fragments of demolished buildings, the building offers an overview of the history of Dutch architecture and has come to be known informally as the 'fragment building'.
In the interior more changes were made between the 1920s and 1950s - most multi-coloured wall decorations were painted over.
In the 1960s exposition rooms and several floors were built into the two courtyards.
A renovation of the south wing of the museum, also known as the 'fragment building' or 'Philips Wing', was completed in 1996, the same year that the museum held its first major photography exhibition featuring its extensive collection of 19th-century photos.
In December 2003, the main building of the museum closed for a major renovation.
During this renovation, about 400 objects from the collection were on display in the 'fragment building', including Rembrandt's "The Night Watch" and other 17th-century masterpieces.
The reconstruction of the building was completed on 16 July 2012.
In March 2013, the museum's main pieces of art were moved back from the 'fragment building' (Philips Wing) to the main building.
The building of the Rijksmuseum was designed by Pierre Cuypers and opened in 1885.
In the central axis is a tunnel with the entrances at ground level and the Gallery of Honour at the first floor.
The Rijksmuseum is a "rijksmonument" (national heritage site) since 1970 and was listed in the Top 100 Dutch heritage sites in 1990.
According to Muriel Huisman, Project Architect for the Rijksmuseum's renovation, "Cruz y Ortiz always like to look for synergy between old and new, and we try not to explain things with our architecture.”
With the Rijks, “there’s no cut between old and new; we’ve tried to merge it.
We did this by looking for materials that were true to the original building, resulting in a kind of silent architecture."
The collection contains more than 2,000 paintings from the Dutch Golden Age by notable painters such as Jacob van Ruisdael, Frans Hals, Johannes Vermeer, Jan Steen, Rembrandt, and Rembrandt's pupils.
It also displays the stern of HMS "Royal Charles" which was captured in the Raid on the Medway, and the Hartog plate.
In 2012, the museum took the unusual step of making some 125,000 high-resolution images available for download via its Rijksstudio webplatform, with plans to add another 40,000 images per year until the entire collection of one million works is available, according to Taco Dibbits, director of collections.
On 7 December 2003, the main building of the museum was closed for a renovation until 13 April 2013.
In the preceding decade, the number of visitors had slightly decreased to 0.8 to 1.1 million people.
The museum says after the renovation, the museum's capacity is 1.5 to 2.0 million visitors annually.
Within eight months since the reopening in 2013, the museum was visited by 2 million people.
The museum was the most visited museum in the Netherlands and the 19th most visited art museum in the world in 2013 and 2014.
