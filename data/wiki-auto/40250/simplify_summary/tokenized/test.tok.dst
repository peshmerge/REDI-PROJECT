[CLS] specific impulse ( usually abbreviated " i " ) is a measure of how effectively a rocket uses prop ##ellant or a jet engine uses fuel . [SEP]
[CLS] specific impulse can be calculated in a variety of different ways with different units . [SEP]
[CLS] by definition , it is the total impulse ( or change in momentum ) delivered per unit of prop ##ellant consumed and is dimensional ##ly equivalent to the generated thrust divided by the prop ##ellant mass flow rate or weight flow rate . [SEP]
[CLS] if mass ( ki ##logram , pound - mass , or slug ) is used as the unit of prop ##ellant , then specific impulse has units of velocity . [SEP]
[CLS] if weight ( newton or pound - force ) is used instead , then specific impulse has units of time ( seconds ) . [SEP]
[CLS] multi ##ply ##ing flow rate by the standard gravity ( " g " ) converts specific impulse from the weight basis to the mass basis . [SEP]
[CLS] a propulsion system with a higher specific impulse uses the mass of the prop ##ellant more efficiently . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of a rocket or other vehicle governed by the ts ##iol ##kovsky rocket equation , less prop ##ellant needed for a given delta - v . [SEP]
[CLS] in rockets , this means the vehicle the engine is attached to can more efficiently gain altitude and velocity . [SEP]
[CLS] this effectiveness is less important in jet aircraft that are lifted by aerodynamic forces , use outside air for combustion , and carry payload ##s that are much heavier than the prop ##ellant . [SEP]
[CLS] specific impulse can include the contribution to impulse provided by external air that has been used for combustion and is exhausted with the spent prop ##ellant . [SEP]
[CLS] jet engines use outside air , and therefore have a much higher specific impulse than rocket engines . [SEP]
[CLS] the specific impulse in terms of prop ##ellant mass spent has units of distance per time , which is a notion ##al velocity called the " effective exhaust velocity " . [SEP]
[CLS] this is higher than the " actual " exhaust velocity because the mass of the combustion air is not being accounted for . [SEP]
[CLS] actual and effective exhaust velocity are the same in rocket engines operating in a vacuum . [SEP]
[CLS] specific impulse is inverse ##ly proportional to specific fuel consumption ( sf ##c ) by the relationship " i " = 1 / ( " g " · sf ##c ) for sf ##c in kg / ( n · s ) and " i " = 360 ##0 / sf ##c for sf ##c in lb / ( lb ##f · hr ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the amount of prop ##ellant can be measured either in units of mass or weight . [SEP]
[CLS] if mass is used , specific impulse is an impulse per unit mass , which dimensional analysis shows to have units of speed , specifically the effective exhaust velocity . [SEP]
[CLS] as the si system is mass - based , this type of analysis is usually done in meters per second . [SEP]
[CLS] if a force - based unit system is used , impulse is divided by prop ##ellant weight ( weight is a measure of force ) , resulting in units of time ( seconds ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these two formulation ##s differ from each other by the standard gravitational acceleration ( " g " ) at the surface of the earth . [SEP]
[CLS] the rate of change of momentum of a rocket ( including its prop ##ellant ) per unit time is equal to the thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] the higher the specific impulse , the less prop ##ellant is needed to produce a given thrust for a given time and the more efficient the prop ##ellant is . [SEP]
[CLS] this should not be confused with the physics concept of energy efficiency , which can decrease as specific impulse increases , since propulsion systems that give high specific impulse require high energy to do so . [SEP]
[CLS] thrust and specific impulse should not be confused . [SEP]
[CLS] thrust is the force supplied by the engine and depends on the amount of reaction mass flowing through the engine . [SEP]
[CLS] specific impulse measures the impulse produced per unit of prop ##ellant and is proportional to the exhaust velocity . [SEP]
[CLS] thrust and specific impulse are related by the design and prop ##ellant ##s of the engine in question , but this relationship is ten ##uous . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , l ##h / lo ##x bi ##pro ##pel ##lan ##t produces higher " i " but lower thrust than r ##p - 1 / lo ##x due to the exhaust gases having a lower density and higher velocity ( ho vs co and ho ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in many cases , propulsion systems with very high specific impulse — some ion thrust ##ers reach 10 , 000 seconds — produce low thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] when calculating specific impulse , only prop ##ellant carried with the vehicle before use is counted . [SEP]
[CLS] for a chemical rocket , the prop ##ellant mass therefore would include both fuel and ox ##idi ##zer . [SEP]
[CLS] in rocket ##ry , a heavier engine with a higher specific impulse may not be as effective in gaining altitude , distance , or velocity as a lighter engine with a lower specific impulse , especially if the latter engine possesses a higher thrust - to - weight ratio . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a significant reason for most rocket designs having multiple stages . [SEP]
[CLS] the first stage is opt ##imi ##sed for high thrust to boost the later stages with higher specific impulse into higher altitudes where they can perform more efficiently . [SEP]
[CLS] for air - breathing engines , only the mass of the fuel is counted , not the mass of air passing through the engine . [SEP]
[CLS] air resistance and the engine ' s inability to keep a high specific impulse at a fast burn rate are why all the prop ##ellant is not used as fast as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] if it were not for air resistance and the reduction of prop ##ellant during flight , specific impulse would be a direct measure of the engine ' s effectiveness in converting prop ##ellant weight or mass into forward momentum . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common unit for specific impulse is the second , as values are identical regardless of whether the calculations are done in si , imperial , or customary units . [SEP]
[CLS] nearly all manufacturers quote their engine performance in seconds , and the unit is also useful for specify ##ing aircraft engine performance . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of metres per second to specify effective exhaust velocity is also reasonably common . [SEP]
[CLS] the unit is intuitive when describing rocket engines , although the effective exhaust speed of the engines may be significantly different from the actual exhaust speed , especially in gas - generator cycle engines . [SEP]
[CLS] for air ##bre ##athing jet engines , the effective exhaust velocity is not physically meaningful , although it can be used for comparison purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] meters per second are numerical ##ly equivalent to newton - seconds per kg ( n · s / kg ) , and si measurements of specific impulse can be written in terms of either units interchange ##ably . [SEP]
[CLS] specific fuel consumption is inverse ##ly proportional to specific impulse and has units of g / ( kn · s ) or lb / ( lb ##f · hr ) . [SEP]
[CLS] specific fuel consumption is used extensively for describing the performance of air - breathing jet engines . [SEP]
[CLS] the time unit of seconds to measure the performance of a fuel / engine combination can be thought of as " how many seconds this prop ##ellant can accelerate its own initial mass at 1 g " . [SEP]
[CLS] the more seconds it can accelerate its own mass , the more delta - v it delivers to the whole system . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , given a particular engine and a pound of a particular fuel on the surface of the earth , specific impulse measures how long of a time that engine can ex ##ert a continuous pound of force ( thrust ) until fully burning through that pound of prop ##ellant . [SEP]
[CLS] a given mass of a more energy - dense fuel can burn for a longer duration than some less energy - dense fuel made to ex ##ert the same force while burning in an engine . [SEP]
[CLS] different engine designs burning the same fuel may not be equally efficient at directing their fuel ' s energy into effective thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] in the same manner , some car engines are better built than others to maximize the miles - per - gallon of the gasoline they burn . [SEP]
[CLS] " i " in seconds is the amount of time a rocket engine can generate thrust , given a quantity of prop ##ellant whose weight is equal to the engine ' s thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] the advantage of this formulation is that it may be used for rockets , where all the reaction mass is carried on board , as well as airplanes , where most of the reaction mass is taken from the atmosphere . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , it gives a result that is independent of units used ( provided the unit of time used is the second ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in rocket ##ry , the only reaction mass is the prop ##ellant , so an equivalent way of calculating the specific impulse in seconds is used . [SEP]
[CLS] in rockets , due to atmospheric effects , the specific impulse varies with altitude , reaching a maximum in a vacuum . [SEP]
[CLS] this is because the exhaust velocity isn ' t simply a function of the chamber pressure , but is a function of the difference between the interior and exterior of the combustion chamber . [SEP]
[CLS] values are usually given for operation at sea level ( " sl " ) or in a vacuum ( " va ##c " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the geo ##centric factor of " g " in the equation for specific impulse , many prefer an alternate definition . [SEP]
[CLS] the specific impulse of a rocket can be defined in terms of thrust per unit mass flow of prop ##ellant . [SEP]
[CLS] this is an equally valid ( and in some ways somewhat simpler ) way of defining the effectiveness of a rocket prop ##ellant . [SEP]
[CLS] for a rocket , the specific impulse defined in this way is simply the effective exhaust velocity relative to the rocket , " v " . [SEP]
[CLS] this equation is also valid for air - breathing jet engines , but is rarely used in practice . [SEP]
[CLS] where formula _ 5 is the prop ##ellant mass flow rate , which is the rate of decrease of the vehicle ' s mass . [SEP]
[CLS] a rocket must carry all its fuel with it , so the mass of the un ##burn ##ed fuel must be accelerated along with the rocket itself . [SEP]
[CLS] mini ##mi ##zing the mass of fuel required to achieve a given change in velocity is crucial to building effective rockets . [SEP]
[CLS] the ts ##iol ##kovsky rocket equation shows that for a rocket with a given empty mass and a given amount of fuel , the total change in velocity it can accomplish is proportional to the effective exhaust velocity . [SEP]
[CLS] a spacecraft without propulsion follows an orbit determined by its trajectory and any gravitational field . [SEP]
[CLS] deviation ##s from the corresponding velocity pattern ( these are called δ " v " ) are achieved by sending exhaust mass in the direction opposite to that of the desired velocity change . [SEP]
[CLS] when an engine is run within the atmosphere , the exhaust velocity is reduced by atmospheric pressure , in turn reducing specific impulse . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a reduction in the effective exhaust velocity , versus the actual exhaust velocity achieved in vacuum conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of gas - generator cycle rocket engines , more than one exhaust gas stream is present as turbo ##pu ##mp exhaust gas exits through a separate no ##zzle . [SEP]
[CLS] calculating the effective exhaust velocity requires averaging the two mass flows as well as accounting for any atmospheric pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] for air - breathing jet engines , particularly turbo ##fan ##s , the actual exhaust velocity and the effective exhaust velocity are different by orders of magnitude . [SEP]
[CLS] this is because a good deal of additional momentum is obtained by using air as reaction mass . [SEP]
[CLS] this allows a better match between the airs ##peed and the exhaust speed , which saves energy / prop ##ellant and enormous ##ly increases the effective exhaust velocity while reducing the actual exhaust velocity . [SEP]
[CLS] where v is the actual exhaust jet velocity . [SEP]
[CLS] with constant thrust , the power needed increases as the exhaust velocity , leading to a lower energy efficiency per unit thrust . [SEP]
[CLS] however , real - world vehicles are also limited in the mass amount of prop ##ellant they can carry . [SEP]
[CLS] at low exhaust velocity the amount of reaction mass increases , at very high exhaust velocity the energy required becomes prohibit ##ive . [SEP]
[CLS] theoretically , for a given delta - v , in space , among all fixed values for the exhaust speed the value formula _ 22 is the most energy efficient for a specified ( fixed ) final mass , see energy in spacecraft propulsion . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a variable exhaust speed can be more energy efficient still . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , if a rocket is accelerated from some positive initial speed using an exhaust speed equal to the speed of the rocket no energy is lost as kinetic energy of reaction mass , since it becomes stationary . [SEP]
[CLS] ( theoretically , by making this initial speed low and using another method of obtaining this small speed , the energy efficiency approaches 100 % , but requires a large initial mass . ) [SEP]
[CLS] in this case the rocket keeps the same momentum , so its speed is inverse ##ly proportional to its remaining mass . [SEP]
[CLS] during such a flight the kinetic energy of the rocket is proportional to its speed and , corresponding ##ly , inverse ##ly proportional to its remaining mass . [SEP]
[CLS] the power needed per unit acceleration is constant throughout the flight ; the reaction mass to be expelled per unit time to produce a given acceleration is proportional to the square of the rocket ' s remaining mass . [SEP]
[CLS] also it is advantage ##ous to ex ##pel reaction mass at a location where the gravity potential is low , see obe ##rth effect . [SEP]
[CLS] air - breathing engines such as turbo ##jet ##s increase the momentum generated from their prop ##ellant by using it to power the acceleration of in ##ert air rear ##ward ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it turns out that the amount of energy needed to generate a particular amount of thrust is inverse ##ly proportional to the amount of air propelled rear ##ward ##s , thus increasing the mass of air ( as with a turbo ##fan ) both improves energy efficiency as well as formula _ 4 . [SEP]
[CLS] an example of a specific impulse measured in time is 45 ##3 seconds , which is equivalent to an effective exhaust velocity of 4 , 440 m / s , for the space shuttle main engines when operating in a vacuum . [SEP]
[CLS] an air - breathing jet engine typically has a much larger specific impulse than a rocket ; for example a turbo ##fan jet engine may have a specific impulse of 6 , 000 seconds or more at sea level whereas a rocket would be around 200 – 400 seconds . [SEP]
[CLS] an air - breathing engine is thus much more prop ##ellant efficient than a rocket engine , because the actual exhaust speed is much lower , the air provides an ox ##idi ##zer , and air is used as reaction mass . [SEP]
[CLS] since the physical exhaust velocity is lower , the kinetic energy the exhaust carries away is lower and thus the jet engine uses far less energy to generate thrust ( at sub ##sonic speeds ) . [SEP]
[CLS] while the " actual " exhaust velocity is lower for air - breathing engines , the " effective " exhaust velocity is very high for jet engines . [SEP]
[CLS] this is because the effective exhaust velocity calculation essentially assumes that the prop ##ellant is providing all the thrust , and hence is not physically meaningful for air - breathing engines ; nevertheless , it is useful for comparison with other types of engines . [SEP]
[CLS] the highest specific impulse for a chemical prop ##ellant ever test - fired in a rocket engine was 54 ##2 seconds ( 5 , 320 m / s ) with a trip ##rop ##ellant of lithium , flu ##orin ##e , and hydrogen . [SEP]
[CLS] however , this combination is imp ##rac ##tical ; see rocket prop ##ellant . [SEP]
[CLS] nuclear thermal rocket engines differ from conventional rocket engines in that energy is supplied to the prop ##ellant ##s by an external nuclear heat source instead of the heat of combustion . [SEP]
[CLS] the nuclear rocket typically operates by passing liquid hydrogen gas through an operating nuclear reactor . [SEP]
[CLS] testing in the 1960s yielded specific impulse ##s of about 850 seconds ( 8 , 340 m / s ) , about twice that of the space shuttle engines . [SEP]
[CLS] a variety of other rocket propulsion methods , such as ion thrust ##ers , give much higher specific impulse but with much lower thrust ; for example the hall effect thrust ##er on the smart - 1 satellite has a specific impulse of 1 , 640 s ( 16 , 100 m / s ) but a maximum thrust of only 68 mill ##ine ##wt ##ons . [SEP]
[CLS] the variable specific impulse magnet ##op ##las ##ma rocket ( va ##si ##m ##r ) engine currently in development will theoretically yield 20 , 000 ##− ##30 ##0 , 000 m / s , and a maximum thrust of 5 . 7 newton ##s . [SEP]
