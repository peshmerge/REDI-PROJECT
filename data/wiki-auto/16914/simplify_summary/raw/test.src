Kyushu (九州 , Kyūshū ) is the third largest island of Japan's five main islands.
Its alternative ancient names include Kyūkoku (九国, "Nine Countries") , Chinzei (鎮西, "West of the Pacified Area") , and Tsukushi-no-shima (筑紫島, "Island of Tsukushi") .
The historical regional name Saikaidō (西海道 , lit.
West Sea Circuit) referred to Kyushu and its surrounding islands.
In the 8th-century Taihō Code reforms, Dazaifu was established as a special administrative term for the region.
s of 2016 , Kyushu has a population of 12,970,479 and covers 36782 km2 .
The island is mountainous, and Japan's most active volcano, Mt Aso at 1591 m , is on Kyushu.
There are many other signs of tectonic activity, including numerous areas of hot springs.
The most famous of these are in Beppu, on the east shore, and around Mt. Aso, in central Kyushu.
The island is separated from Honshu by the Kanmon Straits.
Kyushu is the nearest to the Asian continent which made it the gateway to Japan.
The name "Kyūshū" comes from the nine ancient provinces of Saikaidō situated on the island: Chikuzen, Chikugo, Hizen, Higo, Buzen, Bungo, Hyūga, Osumi, and Satsuma.
Kyushu comprises 10.3 percent of the entire population of Japan.
Most of Kyushu's population is concentrated along the northwest, in the cities of Fukuoka and Kitakyushu, with population corridors stretching southwest into Sasebo and Nagasaki and south into Kumamoto and Kagoshima.
Excepting Oita and Miyazaki cities, the eastern seaboard shows a general decline in population.
Kyushu is described as a stronghold of the LDP political party.
Parts of Kyushu have a subtropical climate, particularly Miyazaki prefecture and Kagoshima prefecture.
Major agricultural products are rice, tea, tobacco, sweet potatoes, and soy; silk is also widely produced.
The island is noted for various types of porcelain, including Arita, Imari, Satsuma, and Karatsu.
Heavy industry is concentrated in the north around Fukuoka, Kitakyushu, Nagasaki, and Oita and includes chemicals, automobiles, semiconductors, and metal processing.
In 2010, the graduate employment rate in the region was the lowest nationwide, at 88.9%.
Besides the volcanic area of the south, there are significant mud hot springs in the northern part of the island, around Beppu.
These springs are the site of occurrence of certain extremophile micro-organisms, that are capable of surviving in extremely hot environments.
The island is linked to the larger island of Honshu by the Kanmon Tunnels, which carry both the San'yō Shinkansen and non-Shinkansen trains of the Kyushu Railway Company, as well as vehicular, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic.
The Kanmon Bridge also connects the island with Honshu.
Railways on the island are operated by the Kyushu Railway Company, and Nishitetsu Railway.
