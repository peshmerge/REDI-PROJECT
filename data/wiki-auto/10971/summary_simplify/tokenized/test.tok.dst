[CLS] free - running sleep is a sleep pattern that is not adjusted ( en ##train ##ed ) to the 24 - hour cycle in nature nor to any artificial cycle . [SEP]
[CLS] it occurs as the sleep disorder non - 24 - hour sleep - wake disorder or artificial ##ly as part of experiments used in the study of circa ##dian and other rhythms in biology . [SEP]
[CLS] study subjects are shielded from all time cues , often by a constant light protocol , by a constant dark protocol or by the use of light / dark conditions to which the organism cannot en ##train such as the ultra ##sho ##rt protocol of one hour dark and two hours light . [SEP]
[CLS] the individual ' s or animal ' s circa ##dian phase can be known only by the monitoring of some kind of output of the circa ##dian system , the internal " body clock " . [SEP]
[CLS] when animals or people " free - run " , experiments can be done to see what sort of signals , known as ze ##it ##ge ##bers , are effective in en ##train ##ment . [SEP]
[CLS] also , much work has been done to see how long or short a circa ##dian cycle to which different organisms can be en ##train ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , some animals can be en ##train ##ed to a 22 - hour day , but they can not be en ##train ##ed to a 20 - hour day . [SEP]
[CLS] examples of mask ##ing are morning rush traffic audible to the subjects , or researchers or maintenance staff visiting subjects on a regular schedule . [SEP]
[CLS] among blind people , the cause is the inability to register , and therefore to en ##train to , light cues . [SEP]
[CLS] the many blind people who do en ##train to the 24 - hour light / dark cycle have eyes with functioning re ##tina ##s including operative non - visual light - sensitive cells , ip ##rg ##cs . [SEP]
[CLS] among sighted individuals , fr ##d usually first appears in the teens or early twenties . [SEP]
[CLS] as with delayed sleep phase disorder ( ds ##ps or ds ##pd ) , in the absence of neurological damage due to trauma or stroke , cases almost never appear after the age of 30 . [SEP]
[CLS] in this context , free - running sleep means that a person chooses to sleep when sleepy and to awake ##n spontaneously ( specifically without an alarm clock or reference to the time of day ) . [SEP]
