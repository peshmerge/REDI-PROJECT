Free-running sleep is a sleep pattern that is not adjusted (entrained) to the 24-hour cycle in nature nor to any artificial cycle.
It occurs as the sleep disorder non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder or artificially as part of experiments used in the study of circadian and other rhythms in biology.
Study subjects are shielded from all time cues, often by a constant light protocol, by a constant dark protocol or by the use of light/dark conditions to which the organism cannot entrain such as the ultrashort protocol of one hour dark and two hours light.
The individual's or animal's circadian phase can be known only by the monitoring of some kind of output of the circadian system, the internal "body clock".
When animals or people "free-run", experiments can be done to see what sort of signals, known as zeitgebers, are effective in entrainment.
Also, much work has been done to see how long or short a circadian cycle to which different organisms can be entrained.
For example, some animals can be entrained to a 22-hour day, but they can not be entrained to a 20-hour day.
Examples of masking are morning rush traffic audible to the subjects, or researchers or maintenance staff visiting subjects on a regular schedule.
Among blind people, the cause is the inability to register, and therefore to entrain to, light cues.
The many blind people who do entrain to the 24-hour light/dark cycle have eyes with functioning retinas including operative non-visual light-sensitive cells, ipRGCs.
Among sighted individuals, FRD usually first appears in the teens or early twenties.
As with delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPS or DSPD), in the absence of neurological damage due to trauma or stroke, cases almost never appear after the age of 30.
In this context, free-running sleep means that a person chooses to sleep when sleepy and to awaken spontaneously (specifically without an alarm clock or reference to the time of day).
