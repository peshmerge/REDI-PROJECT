[CLS] max and moritz : a story of seven boy ##ish prank ##s ( original : max und moritz â€“ eine bu ##ben ##ges ##chi ##cht ##e in si ##eb ##en st ##re ##iche ##n ) is a german language illustrated story in verse . [SEP]
[CLS] it is among the early works of busch , yet it already featured many substantial , effect ##ually aesthetic and formal regular ##ities , procedures and basic patterns of busch ' s later works . [SEP]
[CLS] many familiar with comic strip history consider it to have been the direct inspiration for the " katz ##en ##ja ##mmer kids " and " quick & flu ##p ##ke " . [SEP]
[CLS] the german title sat ##iri ##zes the german custom of giving a sub ##ti ##tle to the name of dramas in the form of " ein drama in . . . ak ##ten " ( " a drama in . . . acts " ) , which became di ##ctum in col ##lo ##qui ##al usage for any event with an unpleasant or dramatic course , e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] busch ' s classic tale of the terrible duo ( now in the public domain ) has since become a proud part of the culture in german - speaking countries . [SEP]
[CLS] to this day in germany , austria , and switzerland , a certain familiarity with the story and its rhymes is still presumed , as it is often referenced in mass communication . [SEP]
[CLS] the two lee ##ring faces are synonymous with mischief , and appear almost logo - like in advertising and even graffiti . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , take these stories of two youths , named max and moritz , who , instead of early turning their young minds to useful learning , often lee ##red with ho ##rri ##d features at their lessons and their teachers . [SEP]
[CLS] look now at the empty head : he is for mischief always ready . [SEP]
[CLS] teasing creatures - climbing fences , stealing apples , pear ##s , and qui ##nce ##s , is , of course , a deal more pleasant , and far easier for the present , than to sit in schools or churches , fixed like rooster ##s on their perch ##es [SEP]
[CLS] but o dear , o dear , o dear ##y , when the end comes sad and dr ##ear ##y ! [SEP]
[CLS] all they did this book re ##hear ##ses , both in pictures and in verses . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys tie several crust ##s of bread together with thread , and lay this trap in the chicken yard of bolt ##e , an old widow , causing all the chickens to become fatally en ##tangled . [SEP]
[CLS] this prank is remarkably similar to the eighth history of the classic german prank ##ster tales of till eu ##len ##sp ##ieg ##el . [SEP]
[CLS] the widow hears her dog barking and hu ##rries upstairs , finds the hearth empty and beats the dog . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys torment bo ##ck , a well - liked tailor who has a fast stream flowing in front of his house . [SEP]
[CLS] they saw through the plank ##s of his wooden bridge , making a pre ##car ##ious gap , then tau ##nt him by making goat noises ( a pun on his name being similar to the zoological expression ' buck ' ) , until he runs outside . [SEP]
[CLS] the bridge breaks ; the tailor is swept away and nearly drown ##s ( but for two geese , which he grabs a hold of and which fly high to safety ) . [SEP]
[CLS] although till removes the plank ##s of the bridge instead of saw ##ing them there are some similarities to till eu ##len ##sp ##ieg ##el ( 32nd history ) . [SEP]
[CLS] while their devout teacher , lamp ##el , is busy at church , the boys invade his home and fill his favorite pipe with gunpowder . [SEP]
[CLS] but : " time that comes will quick repair ; yet the pipe retains its share . " [SEP]
[CLS] horrified , he goes into a frenzy , killing them all before going back to sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] hiding out in the grain storage area of a farmer , me ##cke , the boys slit some grain sacks . [SEP]
[CLS] carrying away one of the sacks , farmer me ##cke immediately notices the problem . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys are ground to bits and dev ##oured by the miller ' s ducks . [SEP]
