[CLS] max and moritz : a story of seven boy ##ish prank ##s ( original : max und moritz â€“ eine bu ##ben ##ges ##chi ##cht ##e in si ##eb ##en st ##re ##iche ##n ) is a german language illustrated story in verse . [SEP]
[CLS] this highly in ##vent ##ive , black ##ly humorous tale , told entirely in rhyme ##d couple ##ts , was written and illustrated by wilhelm busch and published in 1865 . [SEP]
[CLS] it is among the early works of busch , yet it already featured many substantial , effect ##ually aesthetic and formal regular ##ities , procedures and basic patterns of busch ' s later works . [SEP]
[CLS] many familiar with comic strip history consider it to have been the direct inspiration for the " katz ##en ##ja ##mmer kids " and " quick & flu ##p ##ke " . [SEP]
[CLS] the german title sat ##iri ##zes the german custom of giving a sub ##ti ##tle to the name of dramas in the form of " ein drama in . . . ak ##ten " ( " a drama in . . . acts " ) , which became di ##ctum in col ##lo ##qui ##al usage for any event with an unpleasant or dramatic course , e . g . " bun ##des ##pr ##asi ##dent ##en ##wa ##hl - drama in dr ##ei ak ##ten " ( " federal presidential elections - drama in three acts " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] busch ' s classic tale of the terrible duo ( now in the public domain ) has since become a proud part of the culture in german - speaking countries . [SEP]
[CLS] even today , parents usually read these tales to their not - yet - liter ##ate children . [SEP]
[CLS] to this day in germany , austria , and switzerland , a certain familiarity with the story and its rhymes is still presumed , as it is often referenced in mass communication . [SEP]
[CLS] the two lee ##ring faces are synonymous with mischief , and appear almost logo - like in advertising and even graffiti . [SEP]
[CLS] during world war 1 , the red baron , manfred von rich ##th ##of ##en , named his dog moritz , giving the name max to another animal given to his friend . [SEP]
[CLS] " max and moritz " is the first published original foreign children ' s book in japan which was translated into roma ##ji by shin ##ji ##ro shi ##bu ##tani and kan ##ame o ##ya ##iz ##u in 1887 as " " ( " naughty stories " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] max and moritz became the forerunner ##s to the comic strip . [SEP]
[CLS] the story inspired rudolph dirk ##s to create the katz ##en ##ja ##mmer kids . [SEP]
[CLS] after world war 2 , german - u . s . composer richard mo ##ha ##upt created together with choreographer alfredo bo ##rt ##ol ##uz ##zi the dance bu ##rle ##sque ( " tan ##z ##bu ##rle ##ske " ) " max und moritz " , which premiered at bad ##isches st ##aa ##ts ##the ##ater karlsruhe on december 18 , 1949 . [SEP]
[CLS] ah , how of ##t we read or hear of boys we almost stand in fear of ! [SEP]
[CLS] for example , take these stories of two youths , named max and moritz , who , instead of early turning their young minds to useful learning , often lee ##red with ho ##rri ##d features at their lessons and their teachers . [SEP]
[CLS] look now at the empty head : he is for mischief always ready . [SEP]
[CLS] teasing creatures - climbing fences , stealing apples , pear ##s , and qui ##nce ##s , is , of course , a deal more pleasant , and far easier for the present , than to sit in schools or churches , fixed like rooster ##s on their perch ##es [SEP]
[CLS] but o dear , o dear , o dear ##y , when the end comes sad and dr ##ear ##y ! [SEP]
[CLS] ' tis a dreadful thing to tell that on max and moritz fell ! [SEP]
[CLS] all they did this book re ##hear ##ses , both in pictures and in verses . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys tie several crust ##s of bread together with thread , and lay this trap in the chicken yard of bolt ##e , an old widow , causing all the chickens to become fatally en ##tangled . [SEP]
[CLS] this prank is remarkably similar to the eighth history of the classic german prank ##ster tales of till eu ##len ##sp ##ieg ##el . [SEP]
[CLS] as the widow cooks her chickens , the boys sneak onto her roof . [SEP]
[CLS] when she leaves her kitchen momentarily , the boys steal the chickens using a fishing pole down the chimney . [SEP]
[CLS] the widow hears her dog barking and hu ##rries upstairs , finds the hearth empty and beats the dog . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys torment bo ##ck , a well - liked tailor who has a fast stream flowing in front of his house . [SEP]
[CLS] they saw through the plank ##s of his wooden bridge , making a pre ##car ##ious gap , then tau ##nt him by making goat noises ( a pun on his name being similar to the zoological expression ' buck ' ) , until he runs outside . [SEP]
[CLS] the bridge breaks ; the tailor is swept away and nearly drown ##s ( but for two geese , which he grabs a hold of and which fly high to safety ) . [SEP]
[CLS] although till removes the plank ##s of the bridge instead of saw ##ing them there are some similarities to till eu ##len ##sp ##ieg ##el ( 32nd history ) . [SEP]
[CLS] while their devout teacher , lamp ##el , is busy at church , the boys invade his home and fill his favorite pipe with gunpowder . [SEP]
[CLS] when he lights the pipe , the blast knocks him unconscious , black ##ens his skin and burns away all his hair . [SEP]
[CLS] but : " time that comes will quick repair ; yet the pipe retains its share . " [SEP]
[CLS] the boys collect bags full of may bugs , which they promptly deposit in their uncle fritz ' s bed . [SEP]
[CLS] uncle is nearly asleep when he feels the bugs walking on his nose . [SEP]
[CLS] horrified , he goes into a frenzy , killing them all before going back to sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys invade a closed bakery to steal some easter sweets . [SEP]
[CLS] attempting to steal pre ##tze ##ls , they fall into a va ##t of dough . [SEP]
[CLS] the baker returns , catches the bread ##ed pair , and ba ##kes them . [SEP]
[CLS] but they survive , and escape by g ##na ##wing through their crust ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] hiding out in the grain storage area of a farmer , me ##cke , the boys slit some grain sacks . [SEP]
[CLS] carrying away one of the sacks , farmer me ##cke immediately notices the problem . [SEP]
[CLS] he puts the boys in the sack instead , then takes it to the mill . [SEP]
[CLS] the boys are ground to bits and dev ##oured by the miller ' s ducks . [SEP]
[CLS] later , no one expresses regret . [SEP]
[CLS] " max und moritz " was adapted into a ballet by richard mo ##ha ##upt and alfredo bo ##rt ##ulu ##zzi . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1956 nor ##bert schultz ##e adapted it into a straightforward children ' s film , " max und moritz " ( 1956 ) . [SEP]
