[CLS] magma ( from ancient greek μ ##α ##γ ##μ ##α ( " magma " ) meaning " thick un ##gue ##nt " ) is the molten or semi - molten natural material from which all ign ##eous rocks are formed . [SEP]
[CLS] magma is found beneath the surface of the earth , and evidence of magma ##tism has also been discovered on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites . [SEP]
[CLS] besides molten rock , magma may also contain suspended crystals and gas bubbles . [SEP]
[CLS] magma is produced by melting of the mantle and / or the crust at various te ##cton ##ic settings , including sub ##duction zones , continental rift zones , mid - ocean ridges and hot ##sp ##ots . [SEP]
[CLS] mantle and crust ##al melt ##s migrate upwards through the crust where they are thought to be stored in magma chambers or trans - crust ##al crystal - rich mu ##sh zones . [SEP]
[CLS] during their storage in the crust , magma compositions may be modified by fraction ##al crystal ##lization , contamination with crust ##al melt ##s , magma mixing , and de ##gas ##sing . [SEP]
[CLS] following their ascent through the crust , magma ##s may feed a volcano or solid ##ify underground to form an intrusion ( e . g . , an ign ##eous di ##ke or a si ##ll ) . [SEP]
[CLS] while the study of magma has historically relied on observing magma in the form of lava flows , magma has been encountered in situ three times during geo ##thermal drilling projects — twice in iceland ( see magma usage for energy production ) , and once in hawaii . [SEP]
[CLS] most magma ##tic liquids are rich in si ##lica . [SEP]
[CLS] si ##lica ##te melt ##s are composed mainly of silicon , oxygen , aluminium , iron , magnesium , calcium , sodium , and potassium . [SEP]
[CLS] the physical behaviour ##s of melt ##s depend upon their atomic structures as well as upon temperature and pressure and composition . [SEP]
[CLS] vis ##cos ##ity is a key melt property in understanding the behaviour of magma ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] more si ##lica - rich melt ##s are typically more polymer ##ized , with more link ##age of si ##lica te ##tra ##hed ##ra , and so are more vis ##cous . [SEP]
[CLS] dissolution of water drastically reduces melt vis ##cos ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] higher - temperature melt ##s are less vis ##cous . [SEP]
[CLS] generally speaking , more ma ##fi ##c magma ##s , such as those that form basalt , are hotter and less vis ##cous than more si ##lica - rich magma ##s , such as those that form r ##hy ##oli ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] low vis ##cos ##ity leads to gentle ##r , less explosive eruptions . [SEP]
[CLS] temperatures of most magma ##s are in the range 700 °c to 1300 °c ( or 1300 °f to 240 ##0 °f ) , but very rare carbon ##ati ##te magma ##s may be as cool as 490 °c , and ko ##mat ##ii ##te magma ##s may have been as hot as 1600 °c . [SEP]
[CLS] at any given pressure and for any given composition of rock , a rise in temperature past the solid ##us will cause melting . [SEP]
[CLS] within the solid earth , the temperature of a rock is controlled by the geo ##thermal gradient and the radioactive decay within the rock . [SEP]
[CLS] the geo ##thermal gradient averages about 25 °c / km with a wide range from a low of 5 – 10 °c / km within oceanic trenches and sub ##duction zones to 30 – 80 °c / km under mid - ocean ridges and volcanic arc environments . [SEP]
[CLS] it is usually very difficult to change the bulk composition of a large mass of rock , so composition is the basic control on whether a rock will melt at any given temperature and pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] the composition of a rock may also be considered to include " volatile " phases such as water and carbon dioxide . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence of volatile phases in a rock under pressure can stabilize a melt fraction . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence of even 0 . 8 % water may reduce the temperature of melting by as much as 100 °c . [SEP]
[CLS] conversely , the loss of water and volatile ##s from a magma may cause it to essentially freeze or solid ##ify . [SEP]
[CLS] also a major portion of almost all magma is si ##lica , which is a compound of silicon and oxygen . [SEP]
[CLS] magma also contains gases , which expand as the magma rises . [SEP]
[CLS] magma that is high in si ##lica resist ##s flowing , so expanding gases are trapped in it . [SEP]
[CLS] pressure builds up until the gases blast out in a violent , dangerous explosion . [SEP]
[CLS] magma that is relatively poor in si ##lica flows easily , so gas bubbles move up through it and escape fairly gently . [SEP]
[CLS] melting of solid rocks to form magma is controlled by three physical parameters : temperature , pressure , and composition . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common mechanisms of magma generation in the mantle are deco ##mp ##ress ##ion melting , heating ( e . g . , by interaction with a hot mantle plume ) , and lowering of the solid ##us ( e . g . , by composition ##al changes such as the addition of water ) . [SEP]
[CLS] mechanisms are discussed further in the entry for ign ##eous rock . [SEP]
[CLS] when rocks melt , they do so slowly and gradually because most rocks are made of several minerals , which all have different melting points ; moreover , the physical and chemical relationships controlling the melting are complex . [SEP]
[CLS] as a rock melt ##s , for example , its volume changes . [SEP]
[CLS] when enough rock is melted , the small g ##lo ##bu ##les of melt ( generally occurring between mineral grains ) link up and soft ##en the rock . [SEP]
[CLS] under pressure within the earth , as little as a fraction of a percent of partial melting may be sufficient to cause melt to be squeezed from its source . [SEP]
[CLS] melt ##s can stay in place long enough to melt to 20 % or even 35 % , but rocks are rarely melted in excess of 50 % , because eventually the melted rock mass becomes a crystal - and - melt mu ##sh that can then as ##cend " en mass ##e " as a dia ##pi ##r , which may then cause further deco ##mp ##ress ##ion melting . [SEP]
[CLS] the degree of partial melting is critical to determination of the characteristics of the magma it produces , and the likelihood that a melt forms reflects the degrees to which incompatible and compatible elements are involved . [SEP]
[CLS] incompatible elements commonly include potassium , bari ##um , ca ##es ##ium , and rub ##idium . [SEP]
[CLS] rock types produced by small degrees of partial melting in the earth ' s mantle are typically al ##kali ##ne ( ca , na ) , pot ##ass ##ic ( k ) and / or per ##al ##kali ##ne ( in which the aluminium to si ##lica ratio is high ) . [SEP]
[CLS] typically , primitive melt ##s of this composition form lamp ##rop ##hy ##re , lamp ##roi ##te , kim ##ber ##lite and sometimes ne ##ph ##elin ##e - bearing ma ##fi ##c rocks such as al ##kali basalt ##s and essex ##ite ga ##bb ##ros or even carbon ##ati ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] peg ##mat ##ite may be produced by low degrees of partial melting of the crust . [SEP]
[CLS] some granite - composition magma ##s are eu ##tec ##tic ( or cote ##ctic ) melt ##s , and they may be produced by low to high degrees of partial melting of the crust , as well as by fraction ##al crystal ##lization . [SEP]
[CLS] at high degrees of partial melting of the crust , gran ##ito ##ids such as ton ##ali ##te , gran ##od ##ior ##ite and mon ##zon ##ite can be produced , but other mechanisms are typically important in producing them . [SEP]
[CLS] when rock melt ##s , the liquid is a " primary melt " . [SEP]
[CLS] primary melt ##s have not undergone any differentiation and represent the starting composition of a magma . [SEP]
[CLS] in nature it is rare to find primary melt ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the le ##uc ##oso ##mes of mig ##mat ##ites are examples of primary melt ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] primary melt ##s derived from the mantle are especially important , and are known as " primitive melt ##s " or primitive magma ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] by finding the primitive magma composition of a magma series it is possible to model the composition of the mantle from which a melt was formed , which is important in understanding evolution of the mantle . [SEP]
[CLS] when it is impossible to find the primitive or primary magma composition , it is often useful to attempt to identify a parental melt . [SEP]
[CLS] a parental melt is a magma composition from which the observed range of magma chemist ##ries has been derived by the processes of ign ##eous differentiation . [SEP]
[CLS] it need not be a primitive melt . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , a series of basalt flows are assumed to be related to one another . [SEP]
[CLS] a composition from which they could reasonably be produced by fraction ##al crystal ##lization is termed a " parental melt " . [SEP]
[CLS] fraction ##al crystal ##lization models would be produced to test the hypothesis that they share a common parental melt . [SEP]
[CLS] at high degrees of partial melting of the mantle , ko ##mat ##ii ##te and pic ##rite are produced . [SEP]
[CLS] magma develops within the mantle or crust where the temperature and pressure conditions favor the molten state . [SEP]
[CLS] after its formation , magma bu ##oya ##ntly rises toward the earth ' s surface . [SEP]
[CLS] as it migrate ##s through the crust , magma may collect and reside in magma chambers ( though recent work suggests that magma may be stored in trans - crust ##al crystal - rich mu ##sh zones rather than dominant ##ly liquid magma chambers ) . [SEP]
[CLS] magma can remain in a chamber until it cool ##s and crystal ##li ##zes forming ign ##eous rock , it er ##upt ##s as a volcano , or moves into another magma chamber . there are two known processes by which magma changes : by crystal ##lization within the crust or mantle to form a pluto ##n , or by volcanic eruption to become lava or te ##ph ##ra . [SEP]
[CLS] when magma cool ##s it begins to form solid mineral phases . [SEP]
[CLS] some of these settle at the bottom of the magma chamber forming cum ##ulates that might form ma ##fi ##c layered intrusion ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] magma that cool ##s slowly within a magma chamber usually ends up forming bodies of pluto ##nic rocks such as ga ##bb ##ro , di ##ori ##te and granite , depending upon the composition of the magma . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatively , if the magma is erupted it forms volcanic rocks such as basalt , andes ##ite and r ##hy ##oli ##te ( the ex ##tr ##us ##ive equivalent ##s of ga ##bb ##ro , di ##ori ##te and granite , respectively ) . [SEP]
[CLS] during a volcanic eruption the magma that leaves the underground is called lava . [SEP]
[CLS] lava cool ##s and solid ##ifies relatively quickly compared to underground bodies of magma . [SEP]
[CLS] this fast cooling does not allow crystals to grow large , and a part of the melt does not crystal ##li ##ze at all , becoming glass . [SEP]
[CLS] rocks largely composed of volcanic glass include obsidian , sc ##oria and pu ##mic ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] before and during volcanic eruptions , volatile ##s such as co and ho partially leave the melt through a process known as ex ##sol ##ution . [SEP]
[CLS] magma with low water content becomes increasingly vis ##cous . [SEP]
[CLS] if massive ex ##sol ##ution occurs when magma heads upwards during a volcanic eruption , the resulting eruption is usually explosive . [SEP]
[CLS] the iceland deep drilling project , while drilling several 5 , 000 ##m holes in an attempt to harness the heat in the volcanic bedrock below the surface of iceland , struck a pocket of magma at 2 , 100 ##m in 2009 . [SEP]
[CLS] because this was only the third time in recorded history that magma had been reached , id ##dp decided to invest in the hole , naming it id ##dp - 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] a cement ##ed steel case was constructed in the hole with a per ##for ##ation at the bottom close to the magma . [SEP]
[CLS] the high temperatures and pressure of the magma steam were used to generate 36 ##m ##w of power , making id ##dp - 1 the world ' s first magma - enhanced geo ##thermal system . [SEP]
