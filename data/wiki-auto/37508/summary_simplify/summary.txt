Magma is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and evidence of magmatism has also been discovered on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites.
Following their ascent through the crust, magmas may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion (e.g., an igneous dike or a sill).
While the study of magma has historically relied on observing magma in the form of lava flows, magma has been encountered in situ three times during geothermal drilling projectsâ€”twice in Iceland (see Magma usage for energy production), and once in Hawaii.
Viscosity is a key melt property in understanding the behaviour of magmas.
Generally speaking, more mafic magmas, such as those that form basalt, are hotter and less viscous than more silica-rich magmas, such as those that form rhyolite.
At any given pressure and for any given composition of rock, a rise in temperature past the solidus will cause melting.
Within the solid earth, the temperature of a rock is controlled by the geothermal gradient and the radioactive decay within the rock.
It is usually very difficult to change the bulk composition of a large mass of rock, so composition is the basic control on whether a rock will melt at any given temperature and pressure.
The composition of a rock may also be considered to include "volatile" phases such as water and carbon dioxide.
The presence of volatile phases in a rock under pressure can stabilize a melt fraction.
Conversely, the loss of water and volatiles from a magma may cause it to essentially freeze or solidify.
Magma that is relatively poor in silica flows easily, so gas bubbles move up through it and escape fairly gently.
Melting of solid rocks to form magma is controlled by three physical parameters: temperature, pressure, and composition.
The most common mechanisms of magma generation in the mantle are decompression melting, heating (e.g., by interaction with a hot mantle plume), and lowering of the solidus (e.g., by compositional changes such as the addition of water).
When rocks melt, they do so slowly and gradually because most rocks are made of several minerals, which all have different melting points; moreover, the physical and chemical relationships controlling the melting are complex.
As a rock melts, for example, its volume changes.
When enough rock is melted, the small globules of melt (generally occurring between mineral grains) link up and soften the rock.
Under pressure within the earth, as little as a fraction of a percent of partial melting may be sufficient to cause melt to be squeezed from its source.
Melts can stay in place long enough to melt to 20% or even 35%, but rocks are rarely melted in excess of 50%, because eventually the melted rock mass becomes a crystal-and-melt mush that can then ascend "en masse" as a diapir, which may then cause further decompression melting.
The degree of partial melting is critical to determination of the characteristics of the magma it produces, and the likelihood that a melt forms reflects the degrees to which incompatible and compatible elements are involved.
Rock types produced by small degrees of partial melting in the Earth's mantle are typically alkaline (Ca, Na), potassic (K) and/or peralkaline (in which the aluminium to silica ratio is high).
Typically, primitive melts of this composition form lamprophyre, lamproite, kimberlite and sometimes nepheline-bearing mafic rocks such as alkali basalts and essexite gabbros or even carbonatite.
Some granite-composition magmas are eutectic (or cotectic) melts, and they may be produced by low to high degrees of partial melting of the crust, as well as by fractional crystallization.
At high degrees of partial melting of the crust, granitoids such as tonalite, granodiorite and monzonite can be produced, but other mechanisms are typically important in producing them.
By finding the primitive magma composition of a magma series it is possible to model the composition of the mantle from which a melt was formed, which is important in understanding evolution of the mantle.
When it is impossible to find the primitive or primary magma composition, it is often useful to attempt to identify a parental melt.
A parental melt is a magma composition from which the observed range of magma chemistries has been derived by the processes of igneous differentiation.
For instance, a series of basalt flows are assumed to be related to one another.
A composition from which they could reasonably be produced by fractional crystallization is termed a "parental melt".
Fractional crystallization models would be produced to test the hypothesis that they share a common parental melt.
At high degrees of partial melting of the mantle, komatiite and picrite are produced.
Magma can remain in a chamber until it cools and crystallizes forming igneous rock, it erupts as a volcano, or moves into another magma chamber.There are two known processes by which magma changes: by crystallization within the crust or mantle to form a pluton, or by volcanic eruption to become lava or tephra.
When magma cools it begins to form solid mineral phases.
Some of these settle at the bottom of the magma chamber forming cumulates that might form mafic layered intrusions.
Magma that cools slowly within a magma chamber usually ends up forming bodies of plutonic rocks such as gabbro, diorite and granite, depending upon the composition of the magma.
Alternatively, if the magma is erupted it forms volcanic rocks such as basalt, andesite and rhyolite (the extrusive equivalents of gabbro, diorite and granite, respectively).
During a volcanic eruption the magma that leaves the underground is called lava.
Before and during volcanic eruptions, volatiles such as CO and HO partially leave the melt through a process known as exsolution.
The Iceland Deep Drilling Project, while drilling several 5,000m holes in an attempt to harness the heat in the volcanic bedrock below the surface of Iceland, struck a pocket of magma at 2,100m in 2009.
A cemented steel case was constructed in the hole with a perforation at the bottom close to the magma.
