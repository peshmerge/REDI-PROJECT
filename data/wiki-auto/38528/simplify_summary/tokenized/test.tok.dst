[CLS] nord ( ] ; ; ) is a department in the far north of france . [SEP]
[CLS] it was created from the western halves of the historical counties of flanders and hai ##naut , and the bishopric of cam ##bra ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] the modern coat of arms was inherited from the county of flanders . [SEP]
[CLS] nord is the country ' s most populous department . [SEP]
[CLS] it also contains the metropolitan region of lille , the fifth - largest urban area in france after paris , lyon , marseille , and toulouse . [SEP]
[CLS] within the department is located the part of france where the french flemish dialect of dutch is still spoken ( along with french ) as a native language . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , the distinct french pic ##ard dialect , ch ' ti is spoken here . [SEP]
[CLS] tribes of the bel ##ga ##e , such as the men ##ap ##ii and ne ##r ##vi ##i were the first peoples recorded in the area later known as nord . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 4th and 5th centuries , roman rulers of " gall ##ia bel ##gic ##a " secured the route from the major port of bono ##nia ( bo ##ulo ##gne ) to colon ##ia ( cologne ) , by co - opt ##ing germanic peoples north - east of this corridor , such as the tung ##ri . [SEP]
[CLS] in effect , the area known later as nord became an iso ##gl ##oss ( linguistic border ) between the germanic and romance languages . [SEP]
[CLS] saxon colon ##isation of the region from the 5th to the 8th centuries likely shifted the iso ##gl ##oss further south so that , by the 9th century , most people immediately north of lille spoke a dialect of old dutch . [SEP]
[CLS] this has remained evident in the place names of the region . [SEP]
[CLS] after the county of flanders became part of france in the 9th century , the iso ##gl ##oss moved north and east . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 14th century , much of the area came under the control of the duchy of burgundy and in subsequent centuries was therefore part of the habsburg netherlands ( from 148 ##2 ) and the spanish netherlands ( 158 ##1 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] areas that later constituted nord were ceded to france by treaties in 1659 , 166 ##8 , and 167 ##8 , becoming the counties of flanders and hai ##naut , and part of the bishopric of cam ##bra ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] on 4 march 1790 , during the french revolution , nord became one of the original 83 departments created to replace the counties . [SEP]
[CLS] modern government policies making french the only official language have led to a decline in use of the dutch west flemish dialect . [SEP]
[CLS] there are currently 20 , 000 speakers of a sub - dialect of west flemish in the arrondissement of dunkirk and it appears likely that this particular sub - dialect will be extinct within decades . [SEP]
[CLS] there is , however , a movement to bring back use of the dutch language as a second official language . [SEP]
[CLS] nord is part of the current ha ##uts - de - france region and is surrounded by the french departments of pas - de - calais and ai ##s ##ne , as well as by belgium and the north sea . [SEP]
[CLS] situated in the north of the country along the western half of the belgian frontier , the department is unusually long and narrow . [SEP]
[CLS] its principal city is lille , which with nearby ro ##uba ##ix , tour ##co ##ing and ville ##neuve d ' as ##c ##q constitutes the center of a cluster of industrial and former mining towns total ##ling slightly over a million inhabitants . [SEP]
[CLS] other important cities are vale ##nc ##ien ##nes , do ##ua ##i , and dunkirk . [SEP]
[CLS] the principal rivers are the following : y ##ser , l ##ys , es ##ca ##ut , scar ##pe , sam ##bre [SEP]
[CLS] nord is the most heavily populated department , with a population of 2 , 61 ##7 , 93 ##9 and an area of 5 , 74 ##3 km ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the president of the departmental council is the una ##ffi ##lia ##ted right - winger jean - rene le ##cer ##f . [SEP]
[CLS] the first president of the fifth republic , general charles de gaulle , was born in lille in the department on 22 november 1890 . [SEP]
[CLS] at the forefront of france ' s 19th century industrial ##isation , the area suffered severely during world war i and now faces the economic , social and environmental problems associated with the decline of coal mining with its neighbours following the earlier decline of the lille - ro ##uba ##ix textile industry . [SEP]
[CLS] until recently , the department was dominated economically by coal mining , which extended through the heart of the department from neighbouring art ##ois into central belgium . [SEP]
