the ptolemaic dynasty was a macedonian greek royal family , which ruled the ptolemaic kingdom in egypt during the hellenistic period .
they were the last dynasty of ancient egypt .
all the male rulers of the dynasty took the name ptolemy .
she was known for her role in the roman political battles between julius caesar and pompey , and later between octavian and mark antony .
her apparent suicide at the conquest by rome marked the end of ptolemaic rule in egypt .
like the earlier dynasties of ancient egypt , the ptolemaic dynasty practices inbreeding including sibling marriage .
