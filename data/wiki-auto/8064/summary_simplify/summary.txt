The Dominican Republic (Spanish: "República Dominicana") is a country in the West Indies that occupies the eastern five-eighths of Hispaniola.
The Dominican Republic's shores are washed by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south.
The Mona Passage, a channel about 130 km wide, separates the country (and Hispaniola) from Puerto Rico.
Conditions are ameliorated in many areas by elevation and by the northeast trade winds, which blow steadily from the Atlantic all year long.
The annual mean temperature is 25 °C ; regional mean temperatures range from 18 °C in the heart of the Cordillera Central (Constanza) to as high as 27 °C in arid regions.
Temperatures rarely rise above 32 °C , and freezing temperatures only occur in winter in the highest mountains.
For the rest of the country, the rain season is from May to November.
The average annual rainfall is 1346 mm , with extremes of 2500 mm or more in the mountainous northeast (the windward side of the island) and 500 mm in the southwestern valleys.
The western valleys, along the Haitian border, remain relatively dry, with less than 760 mm of annual precipitation, due to the rain shadow effect caused by the central and northern mountain ranges.
The Dominican Republic is occasionally damaged by tropical storms and hurricanes, which originate in the mid-Atlantic and southeastern Caribbean from June until November (mainly from August to October) each year.
The Dominican Republic is a country with many mountains, and the highest peaks of the West Indies are found here.
The chains of mountains show a direction northwest-southeast, except in the Southern peninsula (in Haiti) where they have a direction west–east.
The mountains are separated by valleys with the same general direction.
The Artibonite River is the longest river of the island but only 68 km are in the Dominican Republic.
It is around 40 meters below sea level and is a saline lake with a higher concentration of salt than the sea water.
