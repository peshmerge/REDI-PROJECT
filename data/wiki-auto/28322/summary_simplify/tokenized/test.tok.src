[CLS] the complete season , including the mid - season rec ##ap episode , live reunion show , and " back from africa " special documenting the post - " survivor " lives of the contestants , was released on dvd on october 5 , 2010 . [SEP]
[CLS] the sixteen cast ##away ##s were split into two tribes , sam ##bu ##ru and bo ##ran , and were given camps that included pre - constructed fencing to help protect them from wildlife . [SEP]
[CLS] sam ##bu ##ru took an early lead , but the tribe internally was divided equally along age lines ( silas , kim p . , brandon and lindsey as one , and frank , teresa , carl and linda as the other ) . [SEP]
[CLS] at their first tribal council , the age bloc ##s left a stale ##mate tie between carl and lindsey , and with no previous votes to count , a quiz was used , with lindsay winning and putting the younger members in control ; on the next visit to tribal council , linda was eliminated , and both tribes were even at six members . [SEP]
[CLS] on day 13 , the tribes were given a vague clue about sending three members on quest , unaware this would be the first tribal swap for " survivor " . [SEP]
[CLS] silas picked himself along with the two remaining older sam ##bu ##ru , frank and teresa , while kelly , big tom and lex were picked for bo ##ran . [SEP]
[CLS] after informed of the tribal swap , these players joined their new tribe ; frank and teresa quickly went to work with the original bo ##ran members to eliminate silas , while the original bo ##ran members on sam ##bu ##ru learned of lindsay ' s past votes and were able to eliminate her . [SEP]
[CLS] aware that the bo ##ran players were staying to their original tribe , the sam ##bu ##ru members worked to create internal strife within the bo ##ran faction . [SEP]
[CLS] first by convincing them to eliminate clarence as a physical challenge threat , and then by anger ##ing lex as to incorrectly accuse of his bo ##ran tribe member kelly of attempting to vote him off . [SEP]
[CLS] the final four were ethan , lex , big tom , and kim j . kim won the last two immunity challenges ; tom was voted off due to previous schemes to vote against lex ' s group . [SEP]
[CLS] then , lex was voted out by kim ' s solitary vote , as she felt that she would not have a chance at the final tribal council against either lex or ethan , but felt closer to ethan . [SEP]
[CLS] at the final tribal council , kim j . was praised for surviving the game for her age , but accused of riding the coat ##tails of lex , ethan and big tom . [SEP]
[CLS] dalton ross of " entertainment weekly " ranked it as the eighth - worst season of the series , saying that , aside from " some great challenges , not that much else was great . " [SEP]
[CLS] tom sant ##ill ##i of examiner . com ranked it # 26 , saying that following " borneo " and " australian out ##back " , " it was a complete du ##d at the time , " while also noting that winner ethan z ##oh ##n " was just so - so and not that interesting , " and that the cast ' s " let ##har ##gy showed on screen " due to the poor conditions in the filming location . [SEP]
[CLS] it was also ranked 24th by fan site " the purple rock podcast , " which similarly said that " this season suffers because of its location , " and that " the cast on this season is generally pretty decent , and probably would have been much better if they weren ' t constantly sap ##ped of energy by lack of food and water . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 2015 , former " survivor " contestant and reality tv podcast ##er rob ce ##ster ##nin ##o ranked the season 26th out of the first 30 , while a poll on his site saw it rank 19th . [SEP]
[CLS] the season was similarly ranked as the fifth - worst by andrea dei ##her of za ##p ##2 ##it in 2013 , before it was replaced by " " in 2015 . [SEP]
[CLS] in a " fallen comrades " challenge , in which the contestants were quiz ##zed on tri ##via regarding players in the game who had been voted out , the final question was " which female contestant has no piercing ##s ? " [SEP]
[CLS] the official answer , given by kim j to earn the win , was kelly . [SEP]
[CLS] lex answered the question with lindsey ' s name , who , un ##bek ##now ##nst to the producers , also had no piercing ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] had lex been given credit for his correct answer , he and kim j . would have been tied in the challenge and would have faced tie - breaker questions . [SEP]
