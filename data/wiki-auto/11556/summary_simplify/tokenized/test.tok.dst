[CLS] in number theory , the fundamental theorem of arithmetic , also called the unique factor ##ization theorem or the unique - prime - factor ##ization theorem , states that every integer greater than 1 either is a prime number itself or can be represented as the product of prime numbers and that , moreover , this representation is unique , up to ( except for ) the order of the factors . [SEP]
[CLS] the theorem says two things for this example : first , that 1200 can be represented as a product of prime ##s , and second , that no matter how this is done , there will always be exactly four 2 ##s , one 3 , two 5 ##s , and no other prime ##s in the product . [SEP]
[CLS] the requirement that the factors be prime is necessary : factor ##izations containing composite numbers may not be unique ( e . g . , 12 = 2 × 6 = 3 × 4 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this theorem is one of the main reasons why 1 is not considered a prime number : if 1 were prime , then factor ##ization into prime ##s would not be unique ; for example , 2 = 2 × 1 = 2 × 1 × 1 = . . . [SEP]
[CLS] book vii , proposition ##s 30 , 31 and 32 , and book ix , proposition 14 of eu ##cl ##id ' s " elements " are essentially the statement and proof of the fundamental theorem . [SEP]
[CLS] ( in modern terminology : if a prime " p " divides the product " ab " , then " p " divides either " a " or " b " or both . ) [SEP]
[CLS] proposition 30 is referred to as eu ##cl ##id ' s le ##mma , and it is the key in the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic . [SEP]
[CLS] ( in modern terminology : a least common multiple of several prime numbers is not a multiple of any other prime number . ) [SEP]
[CLS] book ix , proposition 14 is derived from book vii , proposition 30 , and proves partially that the decomposition is unique – a point critically noted by andre wei ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , in this proposition the expo ##nent ##s are all equal to one , so nothing is said for the general case . [SEP]
[CLS] article 16 of ga ##uss ' " di ##s ##qui ##sit ##ion ##es arithmetic ##ae " is an early modern statement and proof employing modular arithmetic . [SEP]
[CLS] every positive integer " n " > 1 can be represented in exactly one way as a product of prime powers : where " p " < " p " < . . . < " p " are prime ##s and the " n " are positive integers . [SEP]
[CLS] this representation is commonly extended to all positive integers , including 1 , by the convention that the empty product is equal to 1 ( the empty product corresponds to " k " = 0 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this representation is called the canonical representation of " n " , or the standard form of " n " . [SEP]
[CLS] note that factors " p " = 1 may be inserted without changing the value of " n " ( e . g . , 1000 = 2 ##× ##3 ##× ##5 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , any positive integer can be uniquely represented as an infinite product taken over all the positive prime numbers : where a finite number of the " n " are positive integers , and the rest are zero . [SEP]
[CLS] in particular , the values of additive and multi ##pl ##icative functions are determined by their values on the powers of prime numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] it must be shown that every integer greater than 1 is either prime or a product of prime ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] then , by strong induction , assume this is true for all numbers greater than 1 and less than " n " . [SEP]
[CLS] if " n " is prime , there is nothing more to prove . [SEP]
[CLS] suppose , to the contrary , there is an integer that has two distinct prime factor ##izations . [SEP]
[CLS] we now have two distinct prime factor ##izations of some integer strictly smaller than " n " , which contra ##dict ##s the minimal ##ity of " n " . [SEP]
[CLS] assume that " s " > 1 is the smallest positive integer which is the product of prime numbers in two different ways . [SEP]
[CLS] if any " p " = " q " then , by cancellation , " s " / " p " = " s " / " q " would be another positive integer , different from s , which is greater than 1 and also has two distinct factor ##izations . [SEP]
[CLS] without loss of general ##ity , take " p " < " q " ( if this is not already the case , switch the " p " and " q " designations . ) [SEP]
[CLS] by rear ##rang ##ement we see , [SEP]
[CLS] here " u " = ( ( " p " . . . " p " ) - ( " q " . . . " q " ) ) is positive , for if it were negative or zero then so would be its product with " p " , but that product equals " t " which is positive . [SEP]
[CLS] so " u " is either 1 or factors into prime ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in either case , " t " = " p " " u " yields a prime factor ##ization of " t " , which we know to be unique , so " p " appears in the prime factor ##ization of " t " . [SEP]
[CLS] now , " p " appears in the prime factor ##ization of " t " , and it is not equal to any " q " , so it must be one of the " r " ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] this contradiction shows that " s " does not actually have two different prime factor ##izations . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , there is no smallest positive integer with multiple prime factor ##izations , hence all positive integers greater than 1 factor uniquely into prime ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the first general ##ization of the theorem is found in ga ##uss ' s second monograph ( 1832 ) on bi ##qua ##dra ##tic rec ##ip ##rocity . [SEP]
[CLS] this paper introduced what is now called the ring of ga ##uss ##ian integers , the set of all complex numbers " a " + " bi " where " a " and " b " are integers . [SEP]
[CLS] it is now denoted by formula _ 9 he showed that this ring has the four units ± ##1 and ± " i " , that the non - zero , non - unit numbers fall into two classes , prime ##s and composite ##s , and that ( except for order ) , the composite ##s have unique factor ##ization as a product of prime ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the ring of e ##isen ##stein integers , and he proved it has the six units formula _ 13 and that it has unique factor ##ization . [SEP]
[CLS] in this ring one has [SEP]
[CLS] examples like this caused the notion of " prime " to be modified . [SEP]
[CLS] in formula _ 14 it can be proven that if any of the factors above can be represented as a product , e . g . , 2 = " ab " , then one of " a " or " b " must be a unit . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the traditional definition of " prime " . [SEP]
[CLS] it can also be proven that none of these factors obey ##s eu ##cl ##id ' s le ##mma ; e . g . , 2 divides neither ( 1 + ) nor ( 1 − ) even though it divides their product 6 . [SEP]
[CLS] the mention of formula _ 14 is required because 2 is prime and ir ##red ##ucible in formula _ 20 using these definitions it can be proven that in any integral domain a prime must be ir ##red ##ucible . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1843 ku ##mmer introduced the concept of ideal number , which was developed further by de ##dek ##ind ( 1876 ) into the modern theory of ideals , special subset ##s of rings . [SEP]
[CLS] multiplication is defined for ideals , and the rings in which they have unique factor ##ization are called de ##dek ##ind domains . [SEP]
[CLS] the german edition includes all of his papers on number theory : all the proof ##s of quad ##ratic rec ##ip ##rocity , the determination of the sign of the ga ##uss sum , the investigations into bi ##qua ##dra ##tic rec ##ip ##rocity , and unpublished notes . [SEP]
