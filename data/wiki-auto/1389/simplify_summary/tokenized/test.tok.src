[CLS] ah ##ab ( ; ; ; ) was the seventh king of israel since je ##ro ##bo ##am i , the son and successor of om ##ri , and the husband of je ##ze ##bel of sid ##on , according to the hebrew scriptures . [SEP]
[CLS] the hebrew bible presents ah ##ab as a wicked king , particularly for condo ##ning je ##ze ##bel ' s influence on religious policies and his principal role behind na ##bot ##h ' s arbitrary execution . [SEP]
[CLS] the existence of ah ##ab is historically supported outside the bible . [SEP]
[CLS] sha ##lman ##ese ##r iii documented in 85 ##3 bc that he defeated an alliance of a dozen kings in the battle of q ##ar ##qa ##r ; one of these was ah ##ab . [SEP]
[CLS] ah ##ab became king of israel in the thirty - eighth year of asa , king of judah , and reigned for twenty - two years , according to 1 kings . [SEP]
[CLS] william f . al ##bright dated his reign to 86 ##9 – 850 bc , while e . r . th ##iel ##e offered the dates 87 ##4 – 85 ##3 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] most recently , michael d . co ##ogan has dated ah ##ab ' s reign to 87 ##1 – 85 ##2 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] om ##ri ( ah ##ab ' s father and founder of the short - lived om ##ri dynasty ) seems to have been a successful military leader ; he is reported in the text of the mo ##abi ##te mesh ##a ste ##le to have " op ##pressed mo ##ab for many days " . [SEP]
[CLS] during ah ##ab ' s reign , mo ##ab , which had been conquered by his father , remained tributary . [SEP]
[CLS] ah ##ab was allied by marriage with je ##hosh ##ap ##hat , who was king of judah . [SEP]
[CLS] only with ara ##m damascus is he believed to have had strained relations . [SEP]
[CLS] ah ##ab married je ##ze ##bel , the daughter of the king of tyre . [SEP]
[CLS] 1 kings 16 – 22 tells the story of ah ##ab and je ##ze ##bel , and indicates that je ##ze ##bel was a dominant influence on ah ##ab , inc ##iting him to abandon ya ##h ##we ##h and worship and institute the religion of ba ##al in israel . [SEP]
[CLS] ah ##ab lived in sam ##aria , the royal capital established by om ##ri , and built a temple and altar to ba ##al ( the lord ) there . [SEP]
[CLS] this led to severe consequences for israel , including a drought that lasted for several years and je ##ze ##bel ' s fan ##atic ##al religious persecution of the prophets of ya ##h ##we ##h , which ah ##ab condo ##ned . [SEP]
[CLS] his reputation was so negative that the author of kings attributed the deaths of ab ##ira ##m and se ##gu ##b , the sons of hi ##el of bethel , caused by their father ' s in ##vocation of joshua ' s curse several centuries ago , to his reign in 1 kings 16 : 34 . [SEP]
[CLS] he was succeeded by ah ##azi ##ah and je ##hora ##m , who reigned over israel until je ##hu ' s revolt of 84 ##2 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] the battle of q ##ar ##qa ##r is mentioned in extra - biblical records , and was perhaps at ap ##ame ##a , where sha ##lman ##ese ##r iii of ass ##yria fought a great confederation of princes from ci ##lic ##ia , northern syria , israel , am ##mon , and the tribes of the syrian desert ( 85 ##3 bc ) , including ah ##ab the israeli ##te ( " a - ha - ab - bu sir - ' a - la - a - a " ) and had ##ade ##zer ( " ada ##d - ' id ##ri " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] ah ##ab ' s contribution was estimated at 2 , 000 chariot ##s and 10 , 000 men . [SEP]
[CLS] in reality , however , the number of chariot ##s in ah ##ab ' s forces was probably closer to a number in the hundreds ( based upon archaeological excavations of the area and the foundations of stables that have been found ) . [SEP]
[CLS] if , however , the numbers are referring to allies it could possibly include forces from tyre , judah , edo ##m , and mo ##ab . [SEP]
[CLS] the assyrian king claimed a victory , but his immediate return and subsequent expeditions in 84 ##9 bc and 84 ##6 bc against a similar but unspecified coalition seem to show that he met with no lasting success . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the tan ##akh , however , ah ##ab with 7 , 000 troops had previously overthrow ##n ben - had ##ad and his thirty - two kings , who had come to lay siege to sam ##aria , and in the following year obtained a decisive victory over him at ap ##he ##k , probably in the plain of sharon at anti ##pa ##tri ##s ( 1 kings 20 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a treaty was made whereby ben - had ##ad restored the cities which his father had taken from ah ##ab ' s father , and trading facilities between damascus and sam ##aria were granted . [SEP]
[CLS] je ##z ##ree ##l has been identified as ah ##ab ' s fortified chariot and cavalry base . [SEP]
[CLS] three years later , war broke out east of the jordan river , and ah ##ab with je ##hosh ##ap ##hat of judah went to recover ram ##oth - gil ##ead from the ara ##me ##ans . [SEP]
[CLS] during this battle , ah ##ab disguised himself , but he was mortally wounded by an una ##ime ##d arrow ( 1 kings 22 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the hebrew bible says that dogs licked his blood , according to the prophecy of elijah . [SEP]
[CLS] but the sept ##ua ##gin ##t ( the greek translation of the old testament ) adds that pigs also licked his blood , symbolic ##ally making him uncle ##an to the israeli ##tes , who abs ##tained from pork . [SEP]
[CLS] ah ##ab was succeeded by his sons , ah ##azi ##ah and je ##hora ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] je ##ze ##bel ' s death , however , was more dramatic than ah ##ab ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] as recorded in 2 kings 9 : 30 - 34 , je ##ze ##bel was confronted by je ##hu who had her servants throw her out the window , causing her death . [SEP]
[CLS] 1 kings 16 : 29 through 22 : 40 contains the narrative of ah ##ab ' s reign . [SEP]
[CLS] his reign was slightly more emphasis ##ed upon than the previous kings , due to his b ##lat ##ant trivial ##ization of the " sins of je ##ro ##bo ##am " , which the previous kings of israel were plagued by , and his subsequent marriage with a pagan princess , the nationwide institution of ba ##al worship , the persecution of ya ##h ##we ##h ' s prophets and na ##bot ##h ' s shocking murder . [SEP]
[CLS] these offenses and atrocities stirred up pop ##uli ##st resentment from figures such as elijah and mic ##aia ##h . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , he is referred to by the author of kings as being " more evil than all the kings before him " ( 1 kings 16 : 30 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , there were achievements that the author took note of , including his ability to fort ##ify numerous israeli ##te cities and build an ivory palace ( 1 kings 22 : 39 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] adherents of the ya ##h ##wi ##st religion found their principal champion in elijah . [SEP]
[CLS] his den ##unciation of the royal dynasty of israel and his em ##pha ##tic insistence on the worship of ya ##h ##we ##h and ya ##h ##we ##h alone , illustrated by the contest between ya ##h ##we ##h and ba ##al on mount carmel ( 1 kings 18 ) , form the keynote to a period which culminated in the accession of je ##hu , an event in which elijah ' s chosen disciple eli ##sha was the leading figure and the om ##ride dynasty was brutally defeated .

[CLS] talmud ##ic literature represents him as an enthusiastic idol ##ater who left no hilltop in palestine without an idol before which he bowed , and to which he or his wife , je ##ze ##bel , brought his weight in gold as a daily offering . [SEP]
[CLS] so defiant in his ap ##osta ##sy was he that he had inscribed on all the doors of the city of sam ##aria the words , " ah ##ab hat ##h ab ##jured the living god of israel . " [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , he paid great respect to the representatives of learning , " to the torah given in twenty - two letters , " for which reason he was permitted to reign for twenty - two successive years . [SEP]

[CLS] each of his seventy sons had an ivory palace built for him . [SEP]
[CLS] since , however , it was ah ##ab ' s idol ##at ##rous wife who was the chief ins ##ti ##gat ##or of his crimes ( b . m . 59 ##a ) , some of the ancient teachers gave him the same position in the world to come as a sinn ##er who had rep ##ented ( san ##h . [SEP]
