[CLS] a saint is a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness or closeness to god . [SEP]
[CLS] in roman catholic , eastern orthodox , anglican , oriental orthodox , and lutheran doctrine , all of their faithful deceased in heaven are considered to be saints , but some are considered worthy of greater honor or em ##ulation ; official ecclesiastical recognition , and consequently ve ##ner ##ation , is given to some saints through the process of canon ##ization in the catholic church or g ##lor ##ification in the eastern orthodox church . [SEP]
[CLS] while the english word " saint " originated in christianity , historians of religion now use the app ##ella ##tion " in a more general way to refer to the state of special holiness that many religions attribute to certain people " , with the jewish t ##za ##di ##k , the islamic wal ##i , the hindu ri ##shi or sikh guru , and the buddhist ar ##hat or bo ##dhi ##sat ##tv ##a also being referred to as saints . [SEP]
[CLS] the word α ##γ ##ι ##ος appears 229 times in the greek new testament , and its english translation 60 times in the corresponding text of the king james version of the bible . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " san ##ctus " was originally a technical one in ancient roman religion , but due to its " global ##ized " use in christianity the modern word " saint " in english and its equivalent in romance languages is now also used as a translation of comparable terms for persons " worthy of ve ##ner ##ation for their holiness or san ##ct ##ity " in other religions . [SEP]
[CLS] many religions also use similar concepts ( but different terminology ) to ve ##ner ##ate persons worthy of some honor . [SEP]

[CLS] they ex ##ert " powerful attractive influence on followers but touch the inner lives of others in transforming ways as well " . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the catholic church , a " saint " is anyone in heaven , whether recognized on earth or not , who form the " great cloud of witnesses " ( hebrew ##s 12 : 1 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these " may include our own mothers , grandmother ##s or other loved ones ( cf . [SEP]
[CLS] the title " saint " denotes a person who has been formally canon ##ized , that is , officially and authoritative ##ly declared a saint , by the church as holder of the keys of the kingdom of heaven , and is therefore believed to be in heaven by the grace of god . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many persons that the church believes to be in heaven who have not been formally canon ##ized and who are otherwise titled " saints " because of the fame of their holiness . [SEP]
[CLS] in his book " saint of the day " , editor leonard foley , of ##m says this : the " saints ' surrender to god ' s love was so generous an approach to the total surrender of jesus that the church recognizes them as heroes and heroine ##s worthy to be held up for our inspiration . [SEP]
[CLS] on 3 january 99 ##3 , pope john xv became the first pope to pro ##claim a person a " saint " from outside the diocese of rome : on the petition of the german ruler , he had canon ##ized bishop ulrich of augsburg . [SEP]
[CLS] before that time , the popular " cult ##s " , or ve ##ner ##ations , of saints had been local and spontaneous and were confirmed by the local bishop . [SEP]
[CLS] pope benedict viii later declared the armenian hermit sy ##meo ##n to be a saint , but it was not until the pont ##ific ##ate of pope innocent iii that the pope ##s reserved to themselves the exclusive authority to canon ##ize saints , so that local bishops needed the confirmation of the pope . [SEP]
[CLS] walter of pont ##oise was the last person in western europe to be canon ##ized by an authority other than the pope : hugh de bo ##ves , the archbishop of rouen , canon ##ized him in 115 ##3 . [SEP]
[CLS] thence ##forth a decree of pope alexander iii in 117 ##0 reserved the pre ##ro ##gative of canon ##ization to the pope , ins ##of ##ar as the latin church was concerned . [SEP]
[CLS] one source claims that " there are over 10 , 000 named saints and beat ##ified people from history , the roman martyr ##ology and orthodox sources , but no definitive head count " . [SEP]
[CLS] the latest revision of this book , edited by the jesuit herbert th ##urst ##on and the british author donald at ##t ##water , contains the lives of 2 , 56 ##5 saints . [SEP]
[CLS] mons ##ign ##or robert sar ##no , an official of the congregation for the causes of saints of the holy see , expressed that it is impossible to give an exact number of saints . [SEP]
[CLS] although the term " worship " is sometimes used , it is only used with the older english con ##not ##ation of honoring or respecting ( " du ##lia " ) a person . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the church , divine worship is in the strict sense reserved only to god ( " la ##tri ##a " ) and never to the saints . [SEP]
[CLS] saints are not believed to have power of their own , but only that granted by god . [SEP]
[CLS] relics of saints are respected , or " ve ##ner ##ated " , similar to the ve ##ner ##ation of holy images and icons . [SEP]
[CLS] the practice in past centuries of ve ##ner ##ating relics of saints with the intention of obtaining healing from god through their inter ##ces ##sion is taken from the early church . [SEP]
[CLS] john henry cardinal newman inter ##cede ##d with god to cure him of a physical illness . [SEP]
[CLS] the deacon , jack sullivan , asserted that after addressing newman he was cured of spinal ste ##nosis in a matter of hours . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2009 , a panel of theologians concluded that sullivan ' s recovery was the result of his prayer to newman . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the saints have a special symbol by tradition , e . g . , saint lawrence , deacon and martyr , is identified by a grid ##iro ##n because he is believed to have been burned to death on one . [SEP]
[CLS] this symbol is found , for instance , in the canadian herald ##ry of the office responsible for the st . lawrence sea ##way . [SEP]
[CLS] the first stage in this process is an investigation of the candidate ' s life by an expert . [SEP]
[CLS] after this , the official report on the candidate is submitted to the bishop of the per ##tine ##nt diocese and more study is undertaken . [SEP]
[CLS] the information is then sent to the congregation for the causes of saints of the holy see for evaluation at the universal level of the church . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , after all of these procedures are complete , the pope may canon ##ize the candidate as a saint for ve ##ner ##ation by the universal church . [SEP]
[CLS] in the eastern orthodox church a saint is defined as anyone who is in heaven , whether recognized here on earth , or not . [SEP]
[CLS] by this definition , adam and eve , moses , the various prophets , except for the angels and archangel ##s are all given the title of " saint " . [SEP]
[CLS] saint ##hood in the orthodox church does not necessarily reflect a moral model , but the communion with god : there are countless examples of people who lived in great sin and became saints by hum ##ility and rep ##ent ##ance , such as mary of egypt , moses the ethiopian , and d ##ys ##mas , the rep ##ent ##ant thief who was cr ##uc ##ified . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , a more complete eastern orthodox definition of what a saint is , has to do with the way that saints , through their hum ##ility and their love of human ##kind , saved inside them the entire church , and loved all people . [SEP]
[CLS] this does not , however , make the person a saint ; the person already was a saint and the church ultimately recognized it . [SEP]
[CLS] as a general rule only clergy will touch relics in order to move them or carry them in procession , however , in ve ##ner ##ation the faithful will kiss the relic to show love and respect toward the saint . [SEP]
[CLS] because the church shows no true distinction between the living and the dead ( the saints are considered to be alive in heaven ) , saints are referred to as if they were still alive . [SEP]
[CLS] they are believed to be able to inter ##cede for salvation and help mankind either through direct communion with god , or by personal intervention . [SEP]
[CLS] the saints are seen as models of holiness to be im ##itated , and as a ' cloud of witnesses ' that strengthen and encourage the believer during his or her spiritual journey . [SEP]
[CLS] the ve ##ner ##ation of saints is sometimes misunderstood to be worship , in which case it is der ##isi ##vel ##y termed " ha ##gio ##lat ##ry " . [SEP]
[CLS] bi ##ck ##nell , stated that the anglican view acknowledges that the term " in ##vocation may mean either of two things : the simple request to a saint for his prayers ( inter ##ces ##sion ) , ' or ##a pro no ##bis , ' or a request for some particular benefit . [SEP]
[CLS] anglican ##s believe that the only effective media ##tor between the believer and god the father , in terms of redemption and salvation , is god the son , jesus christ . [SEP]
[CLS] those who be ##see ##ch the saints to inter ##cede on their behalf make a distinction between " media ##tor " and " inter ##ces ##sor " , and claim that asking for the prayers of the saints is no different in kind than asking for the prayers of living christians . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the church of england , a saint is one who is san ##ct ##ified , as it translates in the authorised king james version ( 1611 ) 2 chronicles 6 : 41 now therefore arise , o lord god , into thy resting place , thou , and the ark of thy strength : let thy priests , o lord god , be clothed with salvation , and let thy saints re ##jo ##ice in goodness . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the church still recognizes and honors specific saints , including some of those recognized by the catholic church , but in a qualified way : according to the augsburg confession , the term " saint " is used in the manner of the catholic church only ins ##of ##ar as to denote a person who received exceptional grace , was sustained by faith , and whose good works are to be an example to any christian . [SEP]
[CLS] traditional lutheran belief accounts that prayers " to " the saints are prohibited , as they are not media ##tors of redemption . [SEP]
[CLS] but , lutheran ##s do believe that saints pray for the christian church in general . [SEP]
[CLS] methodist ##s believe that all christians are " saints " , but mainly use the term to refer to biblical figures , christian leaders , and martyrs of the faith . [SEP]
[CLS] many methodist churches are named after saints — such as the twelve apostles , john wesley , etc . — although most are named after geographical locations associated with an early circuit or prominent location . [SEP]
[CLS] in many protestant churches , the word " saint " is used more generally to refer to anyone who is a christian . [SEP]
[CLS] this is similar in usage to paul ' s numerous references in the new testament of the bible . [SEP]
[CLS] in this sense , anyone who is within the body of christ ( i . e . , a prof ##ess ##ing christian ) is a ' saint ' because of their relationship with christ jesus . [SEP]
[CLS] many protestants consider inter ##ces ##sor ##y prayers to the saints to be idol ##at ##ry as an application of divine worship that should be given only to god himself is being given to other believers , dead or alive . [SEP]
[CLS] many protestant sect ##s also consider the practice to be similar to nec ##rom ##ancy as the dead are believed to be awaiting resurrection , unable to do anything for the living saint . [SEP]
[CLS] many emphasize the traditional new testament meaning of the word , preferring to write " saint " to refer to any believer , in continuity with the doctrine of the priesthood of all believers . [SEP]
[CLS] the beliefs within the church of jesus christ of latter - day saints ( mormon ##s ) with regard to saints are similar but not quite the same as the protestant tradition . [SEP]
[CLS] in the new testament , saints are all those who have entered into the christian covenant of baptism . [SEP]
[CLS] the qualification " latter - day " refers to the doctrine that members are living in the " latter days " , before the second coming of christ , and is used to distinguish the members of the church , which considers itself the restoration of the ancient christian church . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of the term " saint " is not exclusive to christianity . [SEP]
[CLS] in many religions , there are people who have been recognized within their tradition as having fulfilled the highest aspirations of religious teaching . [SEP]
[CLS] in english , the term saint is often used to translate this idea from many world religions . [SEP]
[CLS] cuban sant ##eria , haitian vo ##dou , trinidad or ##isha - shang ##o , brazilian um ##band ##a , can ##dom ##ble , and other similar sync ##ret ##ist religions adopted the catholic saints , or at least the images of the saints , and applied their own spirits / deities to them . [SEP]
[CLS] the name " sant ##eria " was originally a pe ##jo ##rative term for those whose worship of saints devi ##ated from catholic norms . [SEP]
[CLS] tibetan buddhist ##s hold the " tu ##lk ##us " ( rein ##car ##nate ##s of deceased eminent practitioners ) as living saints on earth . [SEP]
[CLS] hindu saints are those recognized by hindus as showing a great degree of holiness and san ##ct ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no formal canon ##ization process in hinduism , but over time , many men and women have reached the status of saints among their followers and among hindus in general ( unlike in christianity , hinduism does not canon ##ize people as saints after death , but they can be accepted as saints during their lifetime ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some hindu saints are given god - like status , being seen as incarnation ##s of vishnu , shiva , devi and other aspects of the divine — this can happen during their lifetime ##s , or sometimes many years after their deaths . [SEP]
[CLS] islam has had a rich history of ve ##ner ##ation of saints ( often called " wal ##i " , which literally means " friend of god " ) , which has declined in some parts of the islamic world in the twentieth century due to the influence of the various streams of sal ##af ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] in sunni islam , the ve ##ner ##ation of saints became a very common form of devotion early on , and saints came to be defined in the eighth - century as a group of " special people chosen by god and endowed with exceptional gifts , such as the ability to work miracles . " [SEP]
[CLS] the classical sunni scholars came to recognize and honor these individuals as venerable people who were both " loved by god and developed a close relationship of love to him . " [SEP]
[CLS] " belief in the miracles of saints ( " kara ##mat al - aw ##li ##ya ##ʾ " ) . . . became a requirement in sunni islam during the classical period , " with even medieval critics of the ubiquitous practice of grave visitation like ibn tay ##mi ##yya ##h em ##pha ##tically declaring : " the miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct , and acknowledged by all muslim scholars . [SEP]
[CLS] the quran has pointed to it in different places , and the saying ##s of the prophet have mentioned it , and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are inn ##ova ##tors or following inn ##ova ##tors . " [SEP]
[CLS] the vast majority of saints ve ##ner ##ated in the classical sunni world were the sufi ##s , who were all sunni mystic ##s who belonged to one of the four orthodox legal schools of sunni law . [SEP]
[CLS] ve ##ner ##ation of saints eventually became one of the most widespread sunni practices for more than a millennium , before it was opposed in the twentieth century by the sal ##af ##i movement , whose various streams regard it as " being both un - islamic and backwards . . . rather than the integral part of islam which they were for over a millennium . " [SEP]
[CLS] in a manner similar to the protestant reformation , the specific traditional practices which sal ##af ##ism has tried to curt ##ail in both sunni and shia contexts include those of the ve ##ner ##ation of saints , visiting their graves , seeking their inter ##ces ##sion , and honoring their relics . [SEP]
[CLS] as christopher taylor has remarked : " throughout islamic history a vital dimension of islamic pie ##ty was the ve ##ner ##ation of muslim saints . . . . [SEP]
[CLS] due , however to certain strains of thought within the islamic tradition itself , particularly pronounced in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries . . . some modern day muslims have either resisted acknowledging the existence of muslim saints altogether or have viewed their presence and ve ##ner ##ation as unacceptable deviation ##s . " [SEP]
[CLS] the term " t ##za ##di ##k " ( " righteous " ) , and its associated meanings , developed in rabbi ##nic thought from its talmud ##ic contrast with " has ##id " ( " pious " ) , to its exploration in ethical literature , and its es ##oteric spiritual ##isation in ka ##bba ##lah . [SEP]
[CLS] in has ##idi ##c judaism , the institution of the t ##za ##di ##k assumed central importance , combining former elite mystic ##ism with social movement for the first time . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " sant " is applied in the sikh and related communities to beings that have attained enlightenment through god realization and spiritual union with god via repeatedly rec ##iting the name of god ( na ##am ja ##po ) . [SEP]
[CLS] sikhs are encouraged to follow the congregation of a sant ( sad ##h sang ##at ) or " the company of the holy " . [SEP]
