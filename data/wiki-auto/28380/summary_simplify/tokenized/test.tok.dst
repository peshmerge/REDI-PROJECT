[CLS] e ##isen ##stein was born to a middle - class family in riga , latvia ( then part of the russian empire in the governorate of liv ##onia ) , but his family moved frequently in his early years , as e ##isen ##stein continued to do throughout his life . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein was raised as an orthodox christian , but became an atheist later on . [SEP]
[CLS] at this time , he was exposed to ka ##bu ##ki theatre and studied japanese , learning some 300 kan ##ji characters , which he cited as an influence on his pictorial development . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein moved to moscow in 1920 , and began his career in theatre working for pro ##let ##ku ##lt . [SEP]
[CLS] while critics outside soviet russia praised these works , e ##isen ##stein ' s focus in the films on structural issues such as camera angles , crowd movements , and mont ##age brought him and like - minded others such as vs ##ev ##olo ##d pu ##do ##v ##kin and alexander do ##v ##zh ##enko under fire from the soviet film community . [SEP]
[CLS] in the autumn of 1928 , with " october " still under fire in many soviet quarters , e ##isen ##stein left the soviet union for a tour of europe , accompanied by his perennial film collaborator gr ##igo ##ri aleksandr ##ov and cinematographer eduard tis ##se . [SEP]
[CLS] officially , the trip was supposed to allow the three to learn about sound motion pictures and to present themselves as soviet artists in person to the capitalist west . [SEP]
[CLS] for e ##isen ##stein , however , it was also an opportunity to see landscapes and cultures outside the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] in late april 1930 , jesse l . las ##ky , on behalf of paramount pictures , offered e ##isen ##stein the opportunity to make a film in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein proposed a biography of munitions ty ##co ##on basil za ##har ##off and a film version of " arms and the man " by george bernard shaw , and more fully developed plans for a film of " su ##tter ' s gold " by b ##laise ce ##ndra ##rs , but on all accounts failed to impress the studio ' s producers . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein completed a script by the start of october 1930 , but paramount disliked it completely and , additionally , found themselves intimidated by major frank peas ##e , president of the hollywood technical director ' s institute . [SEP]
[CLS] on october 23 , 1930 , by " mutual consent " , paramount and e ##isen ##stein declared their contract null and void , and the e ##isen ##stein party were treated to return tickets to moscow at paramount ' s expense . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet film industry was solving the sound - film issue without him ; in addition , his films , techniques and theories , such as his formal ##ist film theory , were becoming increasingly attacked as ' ideological failures ' . [SEP]
[CLS] many of his theoretical articles from this period , such as " e ##isen ##stein on disney " , have surfaced decades later as seminal scholarly texts used as curriculum in film schools around the world . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein and his entourage spent considerable time with charlie chaplin , who recommended that e ##isen ##stein meet with a sympathetic benefactor in the person of american socialist author upton sinclair . [SEP]
[CLS] the two admired each other , and between the end of october 1930 and thanksgiving of that year , sinclair had secured an extension of e ##isen ##stein ' s absence ##s from the ussr , and permission for him to travel to mexico . [SEP]
[CLS] the trip to mexico was for e ##isen ##stein to make a film produced by sinclair and his wife mary , and three other investors organized as the " mexican film trust " . [SEP]
[CLS] on 24 november 1930 , e ##isen ##stein signed a contract with the trust " upon the basis of his desire to be free to direct the making of a picture according to his own ideas of what a mexican picture should be , and in full faith in e ##isen ##stein ' s artistic integrity . " [SEP]
[CLS] the contract also stipulated that the film would be " non - political " , that immediately available funding came from mary sinclair in an amount of " not less than twenty - five thousand dollars " , that the shooting schedule amounted to " a period of from three to four months " , and most importantly that : " e ##isen ##stein furthermore agrees that all pictures made or directed by him in mexico , all negative film and positive prints , and all story and ideas embodied in said mexican picture , will be the property of mrs . sinclair . . . " a cod ##ici ##l to the contract allowed that the " soviet government may have the finished film free for showing inside the u . s . s . r . " reportedly , it was verbal ##ly clarified that the expectation was for a finished film of about an hour ' s duration . [SEP]
[CLS] later he produced a brief syn ##opsis of the six - part film ; this would come , in one form or another , to be the final plan he would settle on for his project . [SEP]
[CLS] whilst in mexico , he mixed socially with fr ##ida ka ##hl ##o and diego rivera ; e ##isen ##stein admired these artists and mexican culture in general , and they inspired him to call his films " moving frescoes " . [SEP]
[CLS] the left - wing u . s . film community eagerly followed his progress within mexico , as is chronicle ##d within chris robe ' s book " left of hollywood : cinema , modernism , and the emergence of u . s . [SEP]
[CLS] under pressure , e ##isen ##stein blamed mary sinclair ' s younger brother , hunter kim ##bro ##ugh , who had been sent along to act as a line producer , for the film ' s problems . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein hoped to pressure the sinclair ##s to ins ##in ##uate themselves between him and stalin , so e ##isen ##stein could finish the film in his own way . [SEP]
[CLS] the furious sinclair ##s shut down production and ordered kim ##bro ##ugh to return to the united states with the remaining film footage and the three soviets to see what they could do with the film already shot ; estimates of the extent of this range from 170 , 000 line ##al feet with " sold ##ade ##ra " un ##film ##ed , to an excess of 250 , 000 line ##al feet . [SEP]
[CLS] when e ##isen ##stein arrived at the american border , a customs search of his trunk revealed sketches and drawings of jesus car ##ica ##tures amongst other lew ##d pornographic material . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein , aleksandr ##ov , and tis ##se were allowed , after a month ' s stay at the u . s . - mexico border outside la ##redo , texas , a 30 - day " pass " to get from texas to new york , and thence depart for moscow , while kim ##bro ##ugh returned to los angeles with the remaining film . [SEP]
[CLS] in mid - 1932 , the sinclair ##s were able to secure the services of sol lesser , who had just opened his distribution office in new york , principal distributing corporation . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein never saw any of the sinclair - lesser films , nor a later effort by his first biographer , marie seton , called " time in the sun " , released in 1940 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1978 , gregor ##i aleksandr ##ov released – with the same name in contra ##vent ##ion to the copyright – his own version , which was awarded the honorable golden prize at the 11th moscow international film festival in 1979 . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein ' s for ##ay into the west made the staunch ##ly stalin ##ist film industry look upon him with a suspicion that would never completely disappear . [SEP]
[CLS] he apparently spent some time in a mental hospital in ki ##sl ##ovo ##ds ##k in july 1933 , ostensibly a result of depression born of his final acceptance that he would never be allowed to edit the mexican footage . [SEP]
[CLS] he was subsequently assigned a teaching position at the state institute of cinematography where he had taught earlier , and in 1933 and 1934 was in charge of writing the curriculum . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1935 , e ##isen ##stein was assigned another project , " be ##zhi ##n meadow " , but it appears the film was af ##flict ##ed with many of the same problems as " ¡ que viva mexico ! " . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein un ##ila ##tera ##lly decided to film two versions of the scenario , one for adult viewers and one for children ; failed to define a clear shooting schedule ; and shot film pro ##di ##gio ##usly , resulting in cost overrun ##s and missed deadline ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] what appeared to save e ##isen ##stein ' s career at this point was that stalin ended up taking the position that the " be ##zhi ##n meadow " catastrophe , along with several other problems facing the industry at that point , had less to do with e ##isen ##stein ' s approach to filmmaking as with the executives who were supposed to have been supervising him . [SEP]
[CLS] ultimately this came down on the shoulders of shu ##my ##ats ##ky , who in early 1938 was denounced , arrested , tried and convicted as a traitor , and shot . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein was thence able to ing ##rat ##iate himself with stalin for ' one more chance ' , and he chose , from two offerings , the assignment of a bio ##pic of " alexander ne ##vsky " , with music composed by sergei pro ##ko ##fi ##ev . [SEP]
[CLS] this time , he was assigned a co - sc ##ena ##rist , p ##yo ##tr pa ##v ##len ##ko , to bring in a completed script ; professional actors to play the roles ; and an assistant director , dmitri va ##sily ##ev , to ex ##ped ##ite shooting . [SEP]
[CLS] the result was a film critically well received by both the soviets and in the west , which won him the order of lenin and the stalin prize . [SEP]
[CLS] this was started , completed , and placed in distribution all within the year 1938 , and represented not only e ##isen ##stein ' s first film in nearly a decade but also his first sound film . [SEP]
[CLS] within months of its release , stalin entered into a pact with hitler , and " alexander ne ##vsky " was promptly pulled from distribution . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein returned to teaching , and was assigned to direct richard wagner ' s " die walk ##ure " at the bo ##ls ##ho ##i theatre . [SEP]
[CLS] after the outbreak of war with germany in 1941 , " alexander ne ##vsky " was re - released with a wide distribution and earned international success . [SEP]
[CLS] with the war approaching moscow , e ##isen ##stein was one of many filmmakers evacuated to alma - ata , where he first considered the idea of making a film about tsar ivan iv . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein corresponded with pro ##ko ##fi ##ev from alma - ata , and was joined by him there in 1942 . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein ' s film " ivan the terrible , part i " , presenting ivan iv of russia as a national hero , won stalin ' s approval ( and a stalin prize ) , but the sequel , " ivan the terrible , part ii " , was criticized by various authorities and went unreleased until 1958 . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein suffered a heart attack on 2 february 1946 , and spent much of the following year recovering . [SEP]
[CLS] his body lay in state in the hall of the cinema workers before being cremated on 13 february , and his ashes were buried in the novo ##dev ##ich ##y cemetery in moscow . [SEP]
[CLS] he and his contemporary lev ku ##les ##ho ##v , two of the earliest film theorists , argued that mont ##age was the essence of the cinema . [SEP]
[CLS] his writings and films have continued to have a major impact on subsequent filmmakers . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein believed that editing could be used for more than just expo ##und ##ing a scene or moment , through a " link ##age " of related images . [SEP]
[CLS] he believed that an idea should be derived from the ju ##xt ##ap ##osition of two independent shots , bringing an element of col ##lage into film . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein taught film - making during his career at gi ##k where he wrote the cu ##rri ##cula for the directors ' course ; his classroom illustrations are reproduced in vladimir ni ##zh ##ni ##i ' s " lessons with e ##isen ##stein " . [SEP]
[CLS] another hypothetical was the staging of the haitian struggle for independence as depicted in ana ##to ##li ##i vin ##og ##rad ##ov ' s " the black consul " , influenced as well by john van ##der ##co ##ok ' s " black majesty " . [SEP]
[CLS] lessons from this scenario del ##ved into the character of jean - jacques des ##sal ##ines , replay ##ing his movements , actions , and the drama surrounding him . [SEP]
[CLS] further to the did ##actic ##s of literary and dramatic content , e ##isen ##stein taught the technical ##ities of directing , photography , and editing , while encouraging his students ' development of individual ##ity , expressive ##ness , and creativity . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##isen ##stein ' s pe ##da ##go ##gy , like his films , was politically charged and contained quotes from vladimir lenin inter ##wo ##ven with his teaching . [SEP]
[CLS] like many bolshevik artists , e ##isen ##stein envisioned a new society which would sub ##si ##di ##ze artists totally , freeing them from the confines of bosses and budgets , leaving them absolutely free to create , but budgets and producers were as significant to the soviet film industry as the rest of the world . [SEP]
[CLS] due to the fledgling war , the revolution - wr ##ack ##ed and isolated new nation didn ' t have the resources to national ##ize its film industry at first . [SEP]
[CLS] when it did , limited resources — both monetary and equipment — required production controls as extensive as in the capitalist world . [SEP]
