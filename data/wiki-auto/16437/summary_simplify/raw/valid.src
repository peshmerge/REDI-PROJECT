The James Norris Memorial Trophy, or simply the Norris Trophy, is awarded annually to the National Hockey League's top "defense player who demonstrates throughout the season the greatest all-round ability in the position".
The James Norris Memorial Trophy has been awarded 61 times to 26 different players since its beginnings in 1954.
At the end of each season, members of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association vote to determine the player who was the best defenseman during the regular season.
The trophy is named in honour of James E. Norris, owner of the National Hockey League's Detroit Red Wings from 1932 to 1952.
Doug Harvey and Nicklas Lidstrom won the award seven times, while Ray Bourque won it five times (Bourque was in the top 3 vote getters for the trophy a further 10 times).
Save for Randy Carlyle and Doug Wilson, every Norris winner eligible to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame has been.
The voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association, and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10–7–5–3–1 point(s) system.
Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL awards ceremony after the conclusion of the playoffs.
