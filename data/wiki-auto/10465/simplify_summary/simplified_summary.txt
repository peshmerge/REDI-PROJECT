emperor buretsudust [unk] 天 皇 , buretsu-tennoguchi was the 25th emperor of japan , according to the traditional order of succession .
no certain dates can be assigned to this emperor 's life or reign .
buretsu ruled the country during the late-fifth century and early-sixth century , but there is a paucity of information about him .
there is not enough information available for further verification and study .
buretsu 's contemporary title would not have been " tenno " .
rather , it was presumably " sumeramikoto " or " amenoshita shiroshimesu okimi " 治 天 下 大 王 ¥ , meaning " the great king who rules all under heaven " .
buretsu might have been referred to as [unk] 大 王 , or the " great king of yamato " .
some believe that this was to justify and praise his successor emperor keitai , who took over under questionable circumstances .
in history textbooks available before and during world war ii , part of buretsu 's record was intentionally omitted .
if emperor keitai began a new dynasty , then buretsu is the last emperor of the first recorded dynasty of japan .
the actual place of buretsu 's grave is not known .
