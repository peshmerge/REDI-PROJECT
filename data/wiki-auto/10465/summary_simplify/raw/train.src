Emperor Buretsu (武烈天皇 , Buretsu-tennō ) was the 25th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
No firm dates can be assigned to this Emperor's life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 498 to 506.
Buretsu is considered to have ruled the country during the late-fifth century and early-sixth century, but there is a paucity of information about him.
Buretsu was a son of Emperor Ninken and his mother is Empress Kasuga no Ōiratsume (春日大娘皇女 ) .
Buretsu's contemporary title would not have been "tennō", as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō.
Rather, it was presumably "Sumeramikoto" or "Amenoshita Shiroshimesu Ōkimi" (治天下大王 ) , meaning "the great king who rules all under heaven".
Some believe that this was to justify and praise his successor Emperor Keitai, who took over under questionable circumstances.
In history textbooks available before and during World War II, part of Buretsu's record was intentionally omitted.
If Emperor Keitai began a new dynasty as some historians believe, then Buretsu is the last Emperor of the first recorded dynasty of Japan.
The actual site of Buretsu's grave is not known.
The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara.
