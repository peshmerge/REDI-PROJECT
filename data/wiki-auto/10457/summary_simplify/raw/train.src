Emperor Richū (履中天皇 , Richū-tennō ) , also known as "Ōenoizahowake no Mikoto" (大兄去来穂別尊 ) was the 17th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
No firm dates can be assigned to this Emperor's life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 400 to 405.
Richū is regarded by historians as a "legendary Emperor" of the 5th century.
The reign of Emperor Kinmei ( 509 – 571 AD), the 29th Emperor, is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates; however, the conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kanmu (737–806), the 50th sovereign of the Yamato dynasty.
Richū's contemporary title would not have been "tennō", as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō.
Rather, it was presumably "Sumeramikoto" or "Amenoshita Shiroshimesu Ōkimi" (治天下大王 ) , meaning "the great king who rules all under heaven".
Richū escaped from Naniwa Place to Isonokami Shrine because of arson.
His tomb is in Kawachi province, in the middle of present-day Osaka Prefecture.
None of his sons succeeded to the throne, although two grandsons would eventually ascend as Emperor Kenzō and as Emperor Ninken.
The site of Richū's grave is not known.
The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") in Sakai, Osaka.
