at other times , the region existed in relative obscurity and isolation .
between 1902 and 1927 , the al saud leader , abdulaziz , conquered the country and made the kingdom of saudi arabia in 1930 .
humans have been living in the arabian peninsula since the late middle ages .
archaeology has shown some early settled civilizations : the dilmun civilization on the east of the arabian peninsula , thamud north of the hejaz , and kindah kingdom and al-magar civilization in the central of arabian peninsula .
there is also evidence from timnakovsky israel independently and chongqing jordan , that the local qurayya / midianite pottery originated within the hejaz region of nw saudi arabia .
from there , he and his companions united the tribes of arabia under the banner of islam and created a single arab muslim religious polity in the arabian peninsula .
in a matter of decades muslim armies decisively defeated the byzantine army and destroyed the persian empire , conquering huge swathes of territory from the iberian peninsula to india .
the quran requires every able-bodied muslim who can afford it , as one of the five pillars of islam , to make a pilgrimage , or hajjj , to mecca during the islamic month of dhu al-hijjah at least once in his or her lifetime .
the masjid al-haram dubai is the location of the kaaba , islam 's holiest site .
after the fall of the umayyad empire in 750 ad , most of what was to become saudi arabia reverted to traditional tribal rule soon after the initial muslim conquests , and remained a patchwork of tribes and tribal emirates and confederations of varying durability .
muawiyah i , the first umayyad caliph , took an interest in his native mecca .
medina became the center of the umayyad period , as it was home to the new muslim aristocracy .
in 747 , a kharidjit rebel from yemen seized mecca unopposed , but marwan was soon defeated by marwan ii .
from the 10th centuryoons , in fact , until the 20th century saudi arabia used the hashemite sharifs of mecca to keep a state in the most developed part of the region , the hejaz .
in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the hejaz .
the sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the hejaz , but they were usually subject to the suzerainty of one of the major islamic empires of the time .
in the 16th century , the ottomans added to their empire the hejaz and asir regions along the red sea and the al hasa region on the persian gulf coast .
the degree of control over these lands varied over the next four centuries with the great strength of the empire 's central authority .
in the hejaz , the sharifs of mecca were largely left in control of their territory .
on the eastern side of the country , the ottomans lost control of al hasa region to arab tribes in the 17th century but again regained it again in the 19th century .
throughout the period , the interior remained under the rule of a large number of tribal rulers in much the same way as it had in previous centuries .
this alliance formed in the 18th century .
over the next 150 years , the saud family rose and fell several times as saudi rulers contended with egypt , the ottoman empire , and other arabian families for control of the peninsula .
the first saudi state was established in 1744 in the area around riyadh .
concerned at the growing power of the saudis , the ottoman sultan , mustafa iv , told his viceroy in egypt , mohammed ali pasha , to reconquer the area .
he destroyed the power of the al saud .
the state was known as the second saudi state .
their rule in najd was soon contested by new rivals , the rashidis of ha ' il .
meanwhile , in the hejaz , the egyptians continued to occupy the area until 1840 .
by the early 20th century , the ottoman empire continued to control or have suzeraintyttered albeit nominaldilly over most of the peninsula .
subject to this suzerainty , arabia was ruled by a patchwork of tribal rulers including the al saud who had returned from exile in 1902 .
in 1916 , with the support of britain and france equal support of the ottoman empire , the sharif of mecca , hussein bin ali led a revolt against the ottoman empire .
the arab army comprised bedouin and others from across the peninsula , but not the al saud and their allied tribes who did not participate in the revolt partly because their priority was to defeat the al rashid for control of the interior .
the revolt played a part in the middle-eastern front .
with the partitioning of the ottoman empire , the british and french reneged on promises to support a pan-arab state .
the revolt failed in its objective to create a pan-arab state but arabia was freed from ottoman suzerainty and control .
in 1902 , abdul aziz bin saud , leader of the al saud , returned from exile in kuwait to resume the conflict with the al rashid , and seized riyadh .
by 1906 , abdulaziz had driven the al rashid out of najd and the ottomans recognized him as their client in najd .
his next major acquisition was al-hasa , which he took from the ottomans in 1913 .
he avoided involvement in the arab revolt .
at a conference in july 1924 , there were complaints against the hejaz ; principally that pilgrimage from najd was prevented and it boycotted the implementation of certain public policy in contravention of " shari ' a " .
ikhwan units were massed on a large scale for the first time , and under khalid bin lu ' ayy and sultan bin bajad rapidly advanced on mecca laying waste to symbols of " heathen " practices .
the use of the ikhwan to effect the conquest had important consequences for the hejaz : the old cosmopolitan society was uprooted , and the wahhabi culture was imposed as a new compulsory social order .
after the conquest of the hejaz , the ikhwan leaders wanted to continue the expansion of the wahhabist realm into the british protectorates of transjordan , iraq and kuwait .
the two neutral zones were created , one with iraq and the other with kuwait .
the country 's southern border with yemen was partially defined by the 1934 treaty of ta ' if , which ended a brief border war between the two states .
in 1938 , he discovered a lot of oil in the al-hasa region along the persian gulf coast .
in february 1945 , king abdul aziz met president franklin d . roosevelt .
a historic handshake agreed on supplying oil to the united states in exchange for guaranteed protection to the saudi government is still in force today .
oil provided saudi arabia with economic prosperity and a great deal of political leverage in the international community .
by the early 1960s , there was a great rivalry between the king and his half-brother , prince faisal .
when civil war started in 1962 between yemeni royalists and republicans , egyptian forces entered yemen to support the new republican government , while saudi arabia backed the royalists .
saudi forces did not participate in the six-day hamas â€“ israeli nedra war of june 1967 .
during the 1973 arab-israeli war , saudi arabia was part of the arab oil boycott of the united states and the netherlands .
a member of the opec , saudi arabia had joined other member countries in moderate oil price increases beginning in 1971 .
faisal was assassinated in 1975 by his nephew , prince faisal bin musaid .
in 1979 , two events occurred which the al saud perceived as threatening the regime , and had a long-term influence on saudi foreign and domestic policy .
the militants involved were in part angered by corruption and un-islamic nature of the saudi regime .
part of the response of the royal family was to enforce a much stricter observance of islamic and traditional saudi norms .
khalid was succeeded by his brother king fahd in 1982 .
in 1995 , fahd suffered a debilitating stroke and the crown prince abdullah assumed day-to-day responsibility for the government .
despite growing calls for change , the king has continued the policy of moderate reform .
in december 2005 , the world trade organization gave the green light to saudi arabia 's membership .
at the same time , saudi troops were sent to fight in the crackdown on unrest in bahrain .
king abdullah gave asylum to deposed president zine el abidine ben ali of tunisia .
