[CLS] the history of saudi arabia in its current form as a state began with its foundation in 1744 , although the human history of the region extends as far as 20 , 000 years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] at other times , the region existed in relative ob ##scu ##rity and isolation , although from the 7th century the cities of mecca and medina had the highest spiritual significance for the muslim world , with mecca becoming the destination for the ha ##j ##j pilgrimage , an obligation , at least once in a believer ' s lifetime , if at all possible . [SEP]
[CLS] for much of the region ' s history a patch ##work of tribal rulers controlled most of the area . [SEP]
[CLS] the al sa ##ud ( the saudi royal family ) emerged as minor tribal rulers in na ##j ##d in central arabia . [SEP]
[CLS] over the following 150 years , the extent of the al sa ##ud territory flu ##ctuated . [SEP]
[CLS] however , between 1902 and 1927 , the al sa ##ud leader , abdul ##azi ##z , carried out a series of wars of conquest which resulted in his establishing the kingdom of saudi arabia in 1930 . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1930 until his death in 1953 , abdul ##azi ##z ruled saudi arabia as an absolute monarchy . [SEP]
[CLS] there is evidence that human habitat ##ion in the arabian peninsula dates back to about 63 , 000 years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , the stone tools from the middle pale ##oli ##thic age along with fossils of other animals discovered at ti ' s al g ##had ##ah , in northwestern saudi arabia , might imply that ho ##mini ##ds migrated through a " green arabia " between 300 , 000 and 500 , 000 years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] archaeology has revealed some early settled civilizations : the dil ##mun civilization on the east of the arabian peninsula , tha ##mu ##d north of the he ##ja ##z , and kinda ##h kingdom and al - mag ##ar civilization in the central of arabian peninsula . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest known events in arabian history are migration ##s from the peninsula into neighbouring areas . [SEP]
[CLS] there is also evidence from tim ##na ( israel ) and ( jordan ) that the local qur ##ay ##ya / midi ##ani ##te pottery originated within the he ##ja ##z region of nw saudi arabia , which suggests that the biblical midi ##ani ##tes originally came from the he ##ja ##z region of nw saudi arabia before expanding into jordan and southern israel . [SEP]
[CLS] muhammad , the prophet of islam , was born in mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610 , but migrated to medina in 62 ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] from there , he and his companions united the tribes of arabia under the banner of islam and created a single arab muslim religious pol ##ity in the arabian peninsula . [SEP]
[CLS] following muhammad ' s death in 63 ##2 , abu ba ##kr became leader of the muslims as the first caliph . [SEP]
[CLS] after putting down a rebellion by the arab tribes ( known as the rid ##da wars , or " wars of ap ##osta ##sy " ) , abu ba ##kr attacked the byzantine empire . [SEP]
[CLS] on his death in 63 ##4 , he was succeeded by umar as caliph , followed by ut ##hman ibn al - af ##fan and ali ibn ab ##i tal ##ib . [SEP]
[CLS] the period of these first four caliph ##s is known as the rashid ##un or " right ##ly guided " caliphate ( " al - k ##hul ##af ##a ' ar - rashid ##un " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] under the rashid ##un caliph ##s , and , from 66 ##1 , their um ##ay ##yad successors , the arabs rapidly expanded the territory under muslim control outside of arabia . [SEP]
[CLS] in a matter of decades muslim armies decisive ##ly defeated the byzantine army and destroyed the persian empire , conquer ##ing huge swat ##hes of territory from the iberian peninsula to india . [SEP]
[CLS] the political focus of the muslim world then shifted to the newly conquered territories . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , mecca and medina remained the spiritual ##ly most important places in the muslim world . [SEP]
[CLS] the quran requires every able - bodied muslim who can afford it , as one of the five pillars of islam , to make a pilgrimage , or ha ##j ##j , to mecca during the islamic month of dh ##u al - hi ##j ##jah at least once in his or her lifetime . [SEP]
[CLS] the masjid al - hara ##m ( the grand mosque ) in mecca is the location of the ka ##aba , islam ' s ho ##liest site , and the masjid al - na ##ba ##wi ( the prophet ' s mosque ) in medina is the location of muhammad tomb ; as a result , from the 7th century , mecca and medina became the pilgrimage destinations for large numbers of muslims from across the muslim world . [SEP]
[CLS] after the fall of the um ##ay ##yad empire in 750 ce , most of what was to become saudi arabia reverted to traditional tribal rule soon after the initial muslim conquest ##s , and remained a shifting patch ##work of tribes and tribal emirates and confederation ##s of varying du ##ra ##bility . [SEP]
[CLS] mu ##aw ##iya ##h i , the first um ##ay ##yad caliph , took an interest in his native mecca , erect ##ing buildings and digging wells . [SEP]
[CLS] under his mar ##wani ##ds successors , mecca became the ab ##ode of poets and musicians . [SEP]
[CLS] even then , medina eclipse ##d mecca in importance for much of the um ##ay ##yad period , as it was home to the new muslim aristocracy . [SEP]
[CLS] under ya ##zi ##d i , the revolt of abd allah bin al - zu ##bai ##r brought syrian troops to mecca . [SEP]
[CLS] an accident led to a fire that destroyed the ka ##aba , which was rebuilt by ibn al - zu ##bai ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] in 747 , a k ##hari ##d ##jit rebel from yemen seized mecca unopposed , but he was soon defeated by mar ##wan ii . [SEP]
[CLS] in 750 , mecca , along with the rest of the caliphate , was passed to the abbas ##ids . [SEP]
[CLS] from the 10th century ( and , in fact , until the 20th century ) the hash ##emi ##te sharif ##s of mecca maintained a state in the most developed part of the region , the he ##ja ##z . [SEP]
[CLS] their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of mecca and medina but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the he ##ja ##z . [SEP]
[CLS] although the sharif ##s exercised at most times independent authority in the he ##ja ##z , they were usually subject to the su ##zer ##aint ##y of one of the major islamic empires of the time . [SEP]
[CLS] in the middle ages , these included the abbas ##ids of baghdad , and the fat ##imi ##ds , a ##y ##yu ##bid ##s and ma ##ml ##uk ##s of egypt . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning with se ##lim i ' s acquisition of medina and mecca in 151 ##7 , the ottomans , in the 16th century , added to their empire the he ##ja ##z and as ##ir regions along the red sea and the al has ##a region on the persian gulf coast , these being the most populous parts of what was to become saudi arabia . [SEP]
[CLS] they also laid claim to the interior , although this remained a rather nominal su ##zer ##aint ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] the degree of control over these lands varied over the next four centuries with the flu ##ct ##uating strength or weakness of the empire ' s central authority . [SEP]
[CLS] in the he ##ja ##z , the sharif ##s of mecca were largely left in control of their territory ( although there would often be an ottoman governor and garrison in mecca ) . [SEP]
[CLS] on the eastern side of the country , the ottomans lost control of the al has ##a region to arab tribes in the 17th century but regained it again in the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] throughout the period , the interior remained under the rule of a large number of petty tribal rulers in much the same way as it had in previous centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] the emergence of the saudi dynasty began in central arabia in 1744 . [SEP]
[CLS] in that year , muhammad ibn sa ##ud , the tribal ruler of the town of ad - dir ' i ##yya ##h near ri ##yad ##h , joined forces with the religious leader muhammad ibn abd - al - wah ##hab , the founder of the wah ##hab ##i movement . [SEP]
[CLS] this alliance formed in the 18th century provided the ideological impetus to saudi expansion and remains the basis of saudi arabian d ##yna ##stic rule today . [SEP]
[CLS] over the next 150 years , the fortunes of the sa ##ud family rose and fell several times as saudi rulers contend ##ed with egypt , the ottoman empire , and other arabian families for control of the peninsula . [SEP]
[CLS] the first saudi state was established in 1744 in the area around ri ##yad ##h and briefly controlled most of the present - day territory of saudi arabia through conquest ##s made between 1786 and 1816 ; these included mecca and medina . [SEP]
[CLS] concerned at the growing power of the saudi ##s , the ottoman sultan , mustafa iv , instructed his viceroy in egypt , mohammed ali pasha , to rec ##on ##que ##r the area . [SEP]
[CLS] ali sent his sons tu ##sun pasha and ibrahim pasha who were eventually successful in routing the saudi forces in 1818 and destroyed the power of the al sa ##ud . [SEP]
[CLS] the al sa ##ud returned to power in 1824 but their area of control was mainly restricted to the saudi heartland of the na ##j ##d region , known as the second saudi state . [SEP]
[CLS] however , their rule in na ##j ##d was soon contested by new rivals , the rashid ##is of ha ' il . [SEP]
[CLS] throughout the rest of the 19th century , the al sa ##ud and the al rashid fought for control of the interior of what was to become saudi arabia . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1891 , the al sa ##ud were con ##clusive ##ly defeated by the al rashid , who drove the saudi ##s into exile in kuwait . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , in the he ##ja ##z , following the defeat of the first saudi state , the egyptians continued to occupy the area until 1840 . [SEP]
[CLS] after they left , the sharif ##s of mecca re ##asse ##rted their authority , albeit with the presence of an ottoman governor and garrison . [SEP]
[CLS] by the early 20th century , the ottoman empire continued to control or have su ##zer ##aint ##y ( albeit nominal ) over most of the peninsula . [SEP]
[CLS] subject to this su ##zer ##aint ##y , arabia was ruled by a patch ##work of tribal rulers ( including the al sa ##ud who had returned from exile in 1902 – see below ) with the sharif of mecca having pre ##emi ##nen ##ce and ruling the he ##ja ##z . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1916 , with the encouragement and support of britain and france ( which were fighting the ottomans in the world war i ) , the sharif of mecca , hussein bin ali , led a pan - arab revolt against the ottoman empire with the aim of securing arab independence and creating a single unified arab state spanning the arab territories from aleppo in syria to aden in yemen . [SEP]
[CLS] the arab army comprised bed ##ouin and others from across the peninsula , but not the al sa ##ud and their allied tribes who did not participate in the revolt partly because of a long - standing rivalry with the sharif ##s of mecca and partly because their priority was to defeat the al rashid for control of the interior . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , the revolt played a part in the middle - eastern front and tied down thousands of ottoman troops thereby contributing to the ottomans ' world war i defeat in 1918 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , with the subsequent partition ##ing of the ottoman empire , the british and french rene ##ged on promises to hussein to support a pan - arab state . [SEP]
[CLS] although hussein was acknowledged as king of the he ##ja ##z , britain later shifted support to the al sa ##ud , leaving him diplomatic ##ally and mil ##ita ##rily isolated . [SEP]
[CLS] the revolt , therefore , failed in its objective to create a pan - arab state but arabia was freed from ottoman su ##zer ##aint ##y and control . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1902 , abdul - aziz bin sa ##ud , leader of the al sa ##ud , returned from exile in kuwait to resume the conflict with the al rashid , and seized ri ##yad ##h – the first of a series of conquest ##s ultimately leading to the creation of the modern state of saudi arabia in 1930 . [SEP]
[CLS] the main weapon for achieving these conquest ##s was the ik ##hwa ##n , the wah ##hab ##ist - bed ##ouin tribal army led by sultan bin baja ##d al - ot ##ai ##bi and fai ##sal al - du ##wai ##sh . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1906 , abdul ##azi ##z had driven the al rashid out of na ##j ##d and the ottomans recognized him as their client in na ##j ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] his next major acquisition was al - has ##a , which he took from the ottomans in 1913 , bringing him control of the persian gulf coast and what would become saudi arabia ' s vast oil reserves . [SEP]
[CLS] he avoided involvement in the arab revolt , having acknowledged ottoman su ##zer ##aint ##y in 1914 , and instead continued his struggle with the al rashid in northern arabia . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1920 , the ik ##hwa ##n ' s attention turned to the south - west , when they seized as ##ir , the region between the he ##ja ##z and yemen . [SEP]
[CLS] in the following year , abdul - aziz finally defeated the al rashid and annexed all northern arabia . [SEP]
[CLS] prior to 1923 , abdul ##azi ##z had not risked invading the he ##ja ##z because hussein bin ali , king of the he ##ja ##z , was supported by britain . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in that year , the british withdrew their support . [SEP]
[CLS] at a conference in ri ##yad ##h in july 1924 complaints were stated against the he ##ja ##z ; principally that pilgrimage from na ##j ##d was prevented and it boycott ##ed the implementation of certain public policy in contra ##vent ##ion of " sha ##ri ' a " . [SEP]
[CLS] ik ##hwa ##n units were mass ##ed on a large scale for the first time , and under khalid bin lu ' a ##y ##y and sultan bin baja ##d rapidly advanced on mecca laying waste to symbols of " heath ##en " practices . [SEP]
[CLS] the ik ##hwa ##n completed their conquest of the he ##ja ##z by the end of 1925 . [SEP]
[CLS] on 10 january 1926 abdul ##azi ##z declared himself king of the he ##ja ##z and , then , on 27 january 1927 he took the title king of na ##j ##d ( his previous title was sultan ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of the ik ##hwa ##n to effect the conquest had important consequences for the he ##ja ##z : the old cosmopolitan society was up ##ro ##oted , and version of wah ##hab ##i culture was imposed as a new compulsory social order . [SEP]
[CLS] by the treaty of jed ##dah , signed on 20 may 1927 , the united kingdom recognized the independence of abdul - aziz ' s realm ( then known as the kingdom of he ##ja ##z and na ##j ##d ) . [SEP]
[CLS] after the conquest of the he ##ja ##z , the ik ##hwa ##n leaders wanted to continue the expansion of the wah ##hab ##ist realm into the british protectorate ##s of trans ##jord ##an , iraq and kuwait . [SEP]
[CLS] abdul - aziz , however , refused to agree to this , recognizing the danger of a direct conflict with the british . [SEP]
[CLS] the ik ##hwa ##n therefore revolt ##ed but were defeated in the battle of sa ##bill ##a in 1929 , and the ik ##hwa ##n leadership were massacre ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1930 , the two kingdoms of the he ##ja ##z and na ##j ##d were united as the ' kingdom of saudi arabia ' . [SEP]
[CLS] boundaries with trans ##jord ##an , iraq , and kuwait were established by a series of treaties negotiated in the 1920s , with two " neutral zones " created , one with iraq and the other with kuwait . [SEP]
[CLS] the country ' s southern boundary with yemen was partially defined by the 1934 treaty of ta ' if , which ended a brief border war between the two states . [SEP]
[CLS] abdul ##azi ##z ' s military and political successes were not mirrored economically until vast reserves of oil were discovered in 1938 in the al - has ##a region along the persian gulf coast . [SEP]
[CLS] development began in 1941 and by 1949 production was in full swing . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 1945 , king abdul aziz met president franklin d . roosevelt aboard the uss " quincy " in the suez canal . [SEP]
[CLS] a historic hands ##hak ##e agreeing on supplying oil to the united states in exchange for guaranteed protection to the saudi regime is still in force today . [SEP]
[CLS] it has survived seven saudi kings and twelve us presidents . [SEP]
[CLS] abdul ##azi ##z died in 1953 . [SEP]
[CLS] king sa ##ud succeeded to the throne on his father ' s death in 1953 . [SEP]
[CLS] oil provided saudi arabia with economic prosperity and a great deal of political leverage in the international community . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time , the government became increasingly waste ##ful and lavish . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the new wealth , extravagant spending led to governmental deficit ##s and foreign borrowing in the 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] however , by the early 1960s an intense rivalry between the king and his half - brother , prince fai ##sal emerged , fueled by doubts in the royal family over sa ##ud ' s competence . [SEP]
[CLS] as a consequence , sa ##ud was deposed in favor of fai ##sal in 1964 . [SEP]
[CLS] the mid - 1960s saw external pressures generated by saudi - egyptian differences over yemen . [SEP]
[CLS] when civil war broke out in 1962 between yemen ##i royalist ##s and republicans , egyptian forces entered yemen to support the new republican government , while saudi arabia backed the royalist ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] tensions subsided only after 1967 , when egypt withdrew its troops from yemen . [SEP]
[CLS] saudi forces did not participate in the six - day ( arab – israeli ) war of june 1967 , but the government later provided annual subsidies to egypt , jordan , and syria to support their economies . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1973 arab - israeli war , saudi arabia participated in the arab oil boycott of the united states and netherlands . [SEP]
[CLS] a member of the op ##ec , saudi arabia had joined other member countries in moderate oil price increases beginning in 1971 . [SEP]
[CLS] after the 1973 war , the price of oil rose substantially , dramatically increasing saudi arabia ' s wealth and political influence . [SEP]
[CLS] fai ##sal was assassinated in 1975 by his nephew , prince fai ##sal bin musa ##id , and was succeeded by his half - brother king khalid during whose reign economic and social development continued at an extremely rapid rate , revolution ##izing the infrastructure and educational system of the country ; in foreign policy , close ties with the us were developed . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1979 , two events occurred which the al sa ##ud perceived as threatening the regime , and had a long - term influence on saudi foreign and domestic policy . [SEP]
[CLS] the first was the iranian islamic revolution . [SEP]
[CLS] there were several anti - government riots in the region in 1979 and 1980 . [SEP]
[CLS] the second event was the seizure of the grand mosque in mecca by islamist ex ##tre ##mist ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the militants involved were in part angered by what they considered to be the corruption and un - islamic nature of the saudi regime . [SEP]
[CLS] part of the response of the royal family was to enforce a much strict ##er ob ##ser ##vance of islamic and traditional saudi norms . [SEP]
[CLS] islam ##ism continued to grow in strength . [SEP]
[CLS] king khalid died in june 1982 . [SEP]
[CLS] khalid was succeeded by his brother king fa ##hd in 1982 , who maintained saudi arabia ’ s foreign policy of close cooperation with the united states and increased purchases of sophisticated military equipment from the united states and britain . [SEP]
[CLS] following the iraqi invasion of kuwait in 1990 , saudi arabia joined the anti - iraq coalition . [SEP]
[CLS] king fa ##hd , fearing an attack from iraq , invited american and coalition soldiers to be stationed in saudi arabia . [SEP]
[CLS] saudi troops and aircraft took part in the subsequent military operations . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1995 , fa ##hd suffered a de ##bil ##itating stroke and the crown prince , prince abdullah assumed day - to - day responsibility for the government . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2003 , saudi arabia refused to support the us and its allies in the invasion of iraq . [SEP]
[CLS] terrorist activity within saudi arabia increased dramatically in 2003 , with the ri ##yad ##h compound bombings and other attacks , which prompted the government to take more string ##ent action against terrorism . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2005 , king fa ##hd died and his half - brother , abdullah , ascended to the throne . [SEP]
[CLS] despite growing calls for change , the king has continued the policy of moderate reform . [SEP]
[CLS] king abdullah has pursued a policy of limited der ##eg ##ulation , privatization and seeking foreign investment . [SEP]
[CLS] in december 2005 , following 12 years of talks , the world trade organization gave the green light to saudi arabia ' s membership . [SEP]
[CLS] as the arab spring unrest and protests began to spread across arab world in early 2011 , king abdullah announced an increase in welfare spending . [SEP]
[CLS] no political reforms were announced as part of the package . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time , saudi troops were sent to participate in the crack ##down on unrest in bahrain . [SEP]
[CLS] king abdullah gave asylum to deposed president z ##ine el ab ##idi ##ne ben ali of tunisia and telephone ##d president ho ##s ##ni mu ##bara ##k of egypt ( prior to his deposition ) to offer his support . [SEP]
[CLS] on 23 january 2015 , king abdullah died and was succeeded by king salman . [SEP]
