[CLS] the pleistocene ( , often colloquially referred to as the ice age ) is the geological epoch which lasted from about 2 , 58 ##8 , 000 to 11 , 700 years ago , spanning the world ' s most recent period of repeated g ##la ##ciation ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the end of the pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period and also with the end of the pale ##oli ##thic age used in archaeology . [SEP]
[CLS] the pleistocene is the first epoch of the qu ##ater ##nary period or sixth epoch of the ce ##no ##zo ##ic era . [SEP]
[CLS] in the ic ##s times ##cal ##e , the pleistocene is divided into four stages or ages , the gel ##asian , calabria ##n , middle pleistocene ( unofficially the ' chiba ##nian ' ) and upper pleistocene ( unofficially the ' tara ##nti ##an ' ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to this international subdivision , various regional subdivisions are often used . [SEP]
[CLS] before a change finally confirmed in 2009 by the international union of geological sciences , the time boundary between the pleistocene and the preceding pl ##io ##cene was regarded as being at 1 . 80 ##6 million years before present ( bp ) , as opposed to the currently accepted 2 . 58 ##8 million years bp : publications from the preceding years may use either definition of the period .

[CLS] charles l ##ye ##ll introduced the term " pleistocene " in 1839 to describe strata in sicily that had at least 70 % of their mo ##llus ##can fauna still living today . [SEP]
[CLS] this distinguished it from the older pl ##io ##cene epoch , which l ##ye ##ll had originally thought to be the youngest fossil rock layer . [SEP]
[CLS] he constructed the name " pleistocene " ( " most new " or " newest " ) from the greek π ##λ ##ε ##ι ##σ ##τ ##ος , " pl ##eis ##tos " , " most " , and κ ##α ##ι ##ν ##ος , " kai ##nos " ( latin ##ized as " c ##æ ##nus " ) , " new " ; this contrasting with the immediately preceding pl ##io ##cene ( " more new " or " newer " , from π ##λ ##ε ##ι ##ω ##ν , " pl ##ei ##on " , " more " , and " kai ##nos " ) , and the immediately subsequent ho ##lo ##cene ( " wholly new " or " entirely new " , from ο ##λ ##ος , " ho ##los " , " whole " , and " kai ##nos " ) epoch , which extends to the present time .
