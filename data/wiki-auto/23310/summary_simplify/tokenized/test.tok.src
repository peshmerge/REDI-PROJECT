[CLS] the pleistocene ( , often colloquially referred to as the ice age ) is the geological epoch which lasted from about 2 , 58 ##8 , 000 to 11 , 700 years ago , spanning the world ' s most recent period of repeated g ##la ##ciation ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the end of the pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period and also with the end of the pale ##oli ##thic age used in archaeology . [SEP]

[CLS] before a change finally confirmed in 2009 by the international union of geological sciences , the time boundary between the pleistocene and the preceding pl ##io ##cene was regarded as being at 1 . 80 ##6 million years before present ( bp ) , as opposed to the currently accepted 2 . 58 ##8 million years bp : publications from the preceding years may use either definition of the period .
