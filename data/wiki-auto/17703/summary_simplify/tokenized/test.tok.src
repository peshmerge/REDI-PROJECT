[CLS] leo is one of the constellation ##s of the zodiac , lying between cancer the crab to the west and vi ##rgo the maiden to the east . [SEP]
[CLS] its name is latin for lion , and to the ancient greeks represented the ne ##me ##an lion killed by the mythical greek hero her ##acle ##s meaning ' glory of her ##a ' ( known to the ancient romans as hercules ) as one of his twelve labor ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the 48 constellation ##s described by the 2nd - century astronomer ptolemy , leo remains one of the 88 modern constellation ##s today , and one of the most easily recognizable due to its many bright stars and a distinctive shape that is reminiscent of the crouch ##ing lion it depicts . [SEP]
[CLS] the lion ' s mane and shoulders also form an as ##ter ##ism known as " the sick ##le , " which to modern observers may resemble a backwards " question mark . " [SEP]
[CLS] leo contains many bright stars , many of which were individually identified by the ancient ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the other named stars in leo are mu leon ##is , ras ##ala ##s ( an abbreviation of " al ras al asa ##d al sham ##ali ##y ##y " , meaning " the lion ' s head toward the south " ) ; and theta leon ##is , cher ##tan or cox ##a ( " hip " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] leo is also home to one bright variable star , the red giant r leon ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] the star wolf 35 ##9 ( cn leon ##is ) , one of the nearest stars to earth at 7 . 8 light - years away , is in leo . [SEP]
[CLS] wolf 35 ##9 is a red dwarf of magnitude 13 . 5 ; it periodically bright ##ens by one magnitude or less because it is a flare star . [SEP]
[CLS] g ##lies ##e 43 ##6 , a faint star in leo about 33 light - years away from the sun , is orbit ##ed by a transit ##ing neptune - mass extras ##olar planet . [SEP]
[CLS] it is about 13 billion years old , making it one of the oldest stars in the galaxy . [SEP]
[CLS] modern astronomers , including ty ##cho bra ##he in 160 ##2 , ex ##cise ##d a group of stars that once made up the " tu ##ft " of the lion ' s tail and used them to form the new constellation coma be ##ren ##ices ( be ##ren ##ice ' s hair ) , although there was precedent for that designation among the ancient greeks and romans . [SEP]
[CLS] the leo ring , a cloud of hydrogen , helium gas , is found in orbit of two galaxies found within this constellation . m ##66 is a spiral galaxy that is part of the leo triple ##t , whose other two members are m ##65 and ngc 36 ##28 . [SEP]
[CLS] it is at a distance of 37 million light - years and has a somewhat distorted shape due to gravitational interactions with the other members of the triple ##t , which are pulling stars away from m ##66 . [SEP]
[CLS] though they are visible as fuzzy objects in small telescopes , their structure is only visible in larger instruments . [SEP]
[CLS] m1 ##0 ##5 is about a degree away from the m ##9 ##5 / m ##9 ##6 pair ; it is an elliptical galaxy of the 9th magnitude , also about 20 million light - years from earth . [SEP]
[CLS] it is very similar in size and shape to the milky way and is located 25 million light - years from earth . [SEP]
[CLS] the star formation in this region is thought to be due to the presence of the dusty bar , which sends shock waves through its rotation to an area with a diameter of 2 , 000 light - years . [SEP]
[CLS] the outskirts of the galaxy have many young open clusters . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the structures found in the constellation are the cl ##owe ##s â€“ campus ##ano l ##q ##g , u ##1 . 11 , u ##1 . 54 , and the huge - l ##q ##g , which are all large qu ##asa ##r groups ; the latter being the second largest structure known ( see also n ##q ##2 - n ##q ##4 gr ##b over ##den ##sity ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in babylonian astronomy , the constellation was called ur . gu . la , the " great lion " ; the bright star reg ##ulus was known as " the star that stands at the lion ' s breast . " [SEP]
[CLS] in greek mythology , leo was identified as the ne ##me ##an lion which was killed by her ##acle ##s ( hercules to the romans ) during the first of his twelve labour ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the ne ##me ##an lion would take women as hostages to its lair in a cave , lu ##ring warriors from nearby towns to save the dams ##el in distress , to their mis ##fort ##une . [SEP]
[CLS] realizing that he must defeat the lion with his bare hands , hercules slipped into the lion ' s cave and engaged it at close quarters . [SEP]
[CLS] when the lion po ##unced , hercules caught it in mid ##air , one hand grasping the lion ' s fore ##leg ##s and the other its hind legs , and bent it backwards , breaking its back and freeing the trapped maiden ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] zeus commemorated this labor by placing the lion in the sky . [SEP]
[CLS] in tropical astro ##logy , the sun is considered to be in the sign leo from july 23 to august 22 , and in side ##real astro ##logy , from august 16 to september 17 . [SEP]
[CLS] the stars delta leon ##is , gamma leon ##is , eta leon ##is , and theta leon ##is form the body of the lion , with gamma leon ##is being of the second magnitude and delta leon ##is and theta leon ##is being of the third magnitude . [SEP]
[CLS] the stars gamma leon ##is , zeta leon ##is , mu leon ##is , epsilon leon ##is , and eta leon ##is form the lion ' s neck , with epsilon leon ##is being of the third magnitude . [SEP]
[CLS] delta leon ##is and beta leon ##is form the lion ' s tail : beta leon ##is , also known as den ##eb ##ola , is the bright tip of the tail with a magnitude of two . [SEP]
[CLS] the stars theta leon ##is , io ##ta leon ##is , and sigma leon ##is form the left hind leg of the lion , with sigma leon ##is being the foot . [SEP]
[CLS] the stars theta leon ##is and r ##ho leon ##is form the right hind leg , with r ##ho leon ##is being the foot . [SEP]
[CLS] the stars eta leon ##is and alpha leon ##is mark the lion ' s heart , with alpha leon ##is , also known as reg ##ulus , being the bright star of magnitude one . [SEP]
[CLS] the stars eta leon ##is and om ##ic ##ron leon ##is form the right front foot of the lion . [SEP]
[CLS] uss leon ##is ( ak - 128 ) was a united states navy crater class cargo ship named after the latin version of this constellation name . " [SEP]
