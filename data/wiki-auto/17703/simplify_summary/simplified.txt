its symbol is unicode [unk] foley .
leo is one of the 88 modern constellations today .
the lion 's mane and shoulders form an asterism known as " the sickle " .

the other named stars in leo are mu leonis , rasalasounded an abbreviation of " al ras al asad al shamaliyy " , meaning " the lion 's head toward the south " ; and theta leonis , chertan or coxahesis " hip " .
leo is also home to one bright variable star , the red giant r leonis .
it has a minimum magnitude of 10 and normal maximum magnitude of 6 .
r leonis , 330 light-years from earth , has a period of 310 days and a diameter of 450 solar diameters .
the star wolf 359 horsemen cn leonisdilly , one of the nearest stars to earth at 7.8 light-years away , is in leo .
wolf 359 is a red dwarf of magnitude 13.5 .
gliese 436 , a faint star in leo about 33 light-years away from the sun , is orbited by a transiting neptune-mass extrasolar planet .
the carbon star cw leonova is the brightest star in the night sky .
the star sdss j102915 + 172927 kunsta 's starcolor is a population ii star in the galactic halo seen in leo .
it is about 13 billion years old .
it has the lowest metallicity of any known star .
modern astronomers , including tycho brahe in 1602 , put a group of stars in the " tuft " of the lion 's tail .
leo contains many bright galaxies ; messier 65 , messier 66 , messier 95 , messier 96 , messier 105 , and ngc 3628 are the most famous .
the leo ring is a cloud of hydrogen , helium gas .
it is at a distance of 37 million light-years .
eventually , the outermost stars may form a dwarf galaxy orbiting m66 .
both m65 and m66 are visible in large binoculars or small telescopes .
both are 20 million light-years from earth .
though they are visible in small telescopes , their structure is only visible in larger instruments .
m95 is a barred spiral galaxy .
m105 is about a degree away from the m95 / m96 pair .
ngc 2903 is a barred spiral galaxy .
it is very similar in size and shape to the milky way .
in its core , ngc 2903 has many " hotspots " , which have been found to be near regions of star formation .
the star formation in this region is due to the presence of the dusty bar , which sends shock waves through its rotation to an area with a diameter of 2,000 light years .
the outskirts of the galaxy have many young open clusters .
leo is also home to some of the largest structures in the universe .
some of the structures found in the constellation are the clowes – campusano lqg , u1.11 , u1.54 , and the huge-lqg , which are all large quasar groups .
the leonids occur in november , peaking on november 14 – 15 , and have a radiant close to gamma leonis .
its parent body is comet tempel-tuttle , which causes significant outbursts every 35 years .
the normal peak rate is about 10 meteors per hour .
the january leonids are a minor shower that can be seen between january 1 and 7 .
leo was one of the earliest recognized constellations .
the persians called leo " ser " or " shir " ; the turks , " artan " ; the syrians , " aryo " ; the jews , " arye " ; the indians , " simha " , all meaning " lion " .

leo is often shown as if the sickle-shaped asterism of stars is the back of the lion 's head .
the sickle is marked by six stars : epsilon leonis , mu leonis , zeta leonis , gamma leonis , eta leonis , and alpha leonis .
the rest of his body is delineated by delta leonis and theta leonis .
h . a . rey has suggested an alternative way to connect the stars , which shows a lion walking .
the stars delta leonis , gamma leonis , eta leonis , and theta leonis form the body of the lion .
the stars gamma leonis , zeta leonis , mu leonis , epsilon leonis , and eta leonis form the lion 's neck .
the stars mu leonis , kappa leonis , lambda leonis , and epsilon leonis form the head of the lion .
delta leonis and beta leonis form the lion 's tail .
the stars theta leonis , iota leonis , and sigma leonis form the left back leg of the lion .
the stars theta leonis and rho leonis form the right back leg .
the stars eta leonis and alpha leonis mark the lion 's heart , with alpha leonis , also known as regulus , being the bright star of magnitude one .
eta leonis and omicron leonis form the right front of the lion .
uss leonis [ ak-128± was a united states navy crater class cargo ship named after the latin version of this constellation name .
