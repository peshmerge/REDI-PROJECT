[CLS] leo is one of the constellation ##s of the zodiac , lying between cancer the crab to the west and vi ##rgo the maiden to the east . [SEP]
[CLS] its name is latin for lion , and to the ancient greeks represented the ne ##me ##an lion killed by the mythical greek hero her ##acle ##s meaning ' glory of her ##a ' ( known to the ancient romans as hercules ) as one of his twelve labor ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] its symbol is ( unicode [UNK] ) . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the 48 constellation ##s described by the 2nd - century astronomer ptolemy , leo remains one of the 88 modern constellation ##s today , and one of the most easily recognizable due to its many bright stars and a distinctive shape that is reminiscent of the crouch ##ing lion it depicts . [SEP]
[CLS] the lion ' s mane and shoulders also form an as ##ter ##ism known as " the sick ##le , " which to modern observers may resemble a backwards " question mark . " [SEP]
[CLS] leo contains many bright stars , many of which were individually identified by the ancient ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the other named stars in leo are mu leon ##is , ras ##ala ##s ( an abbreviation of " al ras al asa ##d al sham ##ali ##y ##y " , meaning " the lion ' s head toward the south " ) ; and theta leon ##is , cher ##tan or cox ##a ( " hip " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] leo is also home to one bright variable star , the red giant r leon ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a mira variable with a minimum magnitude of 10 and normal maximum magnitude of 6 ; it periodically bright ##ens to magnitude 4 . 4 . [SEP]
[CLS] r leon ##is , 330 light - years from earth , has a period of 310 days and a diameter of 450 solar diameter ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the star wolf 35 ##9 ( cn leon ##is ) , one of the nearest stars to earth at 7 . 8 light - years away , is in leo . [SEP]
[CLS] wolf 35 ##9 is a red dwarf of magnitude 13 . 5 ; it periodically bright ##ens by one magnitude or less because it is a flare star . [SEP]

[CLS] it has the lowest metallic ##ity of any known star . [SEP]
[CLS] modern astronomers , including ty ##cho bra ##he in 160 ##2 , ex ##cise ##d a group of stars that once made up the " tu ##ft " of the lion ' s tail and used them to form the new constellation coma be ##ren ##ices ( be ##ren ##ice ' s hair ) , although there was precedent for that designation among the ancient greeks and romans . [SEP]
[CLS] leo contains many bright galaxies ; mess ##ier 65 , mess ##ier 66 , mess ##ier 95 , mess ##ier 96 , mess ##ier 105 , and ngc 36 ##28 are the most famous , the first two being part of the leo triple ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] the leo ring , a cloud of hydrogen , helium gas , is found in orbit of two galaxies found within this constellation . m ##66 is a spiral galaxy that is part of the leo triple ##t , whose other two members are m ##65 and ngc 36 ##28 . [SEP]
[CLS] it is at a distance of 37 million light - years and has a somewhat distorted shape due to gravitational interactions with the other members of the triple ##t , which are pulling stars away from m ##66 . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , the outer ##most stars may form a dwarf galaxy orbiting m ##66 . [SEP]
[CLS] both m ##65 and m ##66 are visible in large binoculars or small telescopes , but their concentrated nuclei and el ##onga ##tion are only visible in large amateur instruments . [SEP]
[CLS] m ##9 ##5 and m ##9 ##6 are both spiral galaxies 20 million light - years from earth . [SEP]
[CLS] though they are visible as fuzzy objects in small telescopes , their structure is only visible in larger instruments . [SEP]
[CLS] m ##9 ##5 is a barred spiral galaxy . [SEP]
[CLS] m1 ##0 ##5 is about a degree away from the m ##9 ##5 / m ##9 ##6 pair ; it is an elliptical galaxy of the 9th magnitude , also about 20 million light - years from earth . [SEP]
[CLS] ngc 290 ##3 is a barred spiral galaxy discovered by william hers ##chel in 1784 . [SEP]
[CLS] it is very similar in size and shape to the milky way and is located 25 million light - years from earth . [SEP]
[CLS] in its core , ngc 290 ##3 has many " hot ##sp ##ots " , which have been found to be near regions of star formation . [SEP]
[CLS] the star formation in this region is thought to be due to the presence of the dusty bar , which sends shock waves through its rotation to an area with a diameter of 2 , 000 light - years . [SEP]
[CLS] the outskirts of the galaxy have many young open clusters . [SEP]
[CLS] leo is also home to some of the largest structures in the ob ##ser ##vable universe . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the structures found in the constellation are the cl ##owe ##s – campus ##ano l ##q ##g , u ##1 . 11 , u ##1 . 54 , and the huge - l ##q ##g , which are all large qu ##asa ##r groups ; the latter being the second largest structure known ( see also n ##q ##2 - n ##q ##4 gr ##b over ##den ##sity ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the leonid ##s occur in november , peaking on november 14 – 15 , and have a radiant close to gamma leon ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] its parent body is comet te ##mp ##el - tu ##ttle , which causes significant outburst ##s every 35 years . [SEP]
[CLS] the normal peak rate is approximately 10 meteor ##s per hour . [SEP]
[CLS] the january leonid ##s are a minor shower that peaks between january 1 and 7 . [SEP]

[CLS] the persians called leo " ser " or " shi ##r " ; the turks , " art ##an " ; the syrian ##s , " ar ##yo " ; the jews , " ar ##ye " ; the indians , " sim ##ha " , all meaning " lion " . [SEP]
[CLS] some myth ##ologists believe that in sum ##eria , leo represented the monster hum ##ba ##ba , who was killed by gil ##games ##h . [SEP]
[CLS] in babylonian astronomy , the constellation was called ur . gu . la , the " great lion " ; the bright star reg ##ulus was known as " the star that stands at the lion ' s breast . " [SEP]
[CLS] reg ##ulus also had distinctly regal associations , as it was known as the king star . [SEP]
[CLS] in greek mythology , leo was identified as the ne ##me ##an lion which was killed by her ##acle ##s ( hercules to the romans ) during the first of his twelve labour ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the ne ##me ##an lion would take women as hostages to its lair in a cave , lu ##ring warriors from nearby towns to save the dams ##el in distress , to their mis ##fort ##une . [SEP]
[CLS] the lion was imp ##er ##vious to any weaponry ; thus , the warriors ' clubs , swords , and spears were rendered useless against it . [SEP]
[CLS] realizing that he must defeat the lion with his bare hands , hercules slipped into the lion ' s cave and engaged it at close quarters . [SEP]
[CLS] when the lion po ##unced , hercules caught it in mid ##air , one hand grasping the lion ' s fore ##leg ##s and the other its hind legs , and bent it backwards , breaking its back and freeing the trapped maiden ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] zeus commemorated this labor by placing the lion in the sky . [SEP]
[CLS] the roman poet o ##vid called it " her ##cule ##us leo " and " violent ##us leo " . [SEP]
[CLS] " ba ##cchi sid ##us " ( star of ba ##cc ##hus ) was another of its titles , the god ba ##cc ##hus always being identified with this animal . [SEP]
[CLS] however , mani ##lius called it " jo ##vis et juno ##nis sid ##us " ( star of jupiter and juno ) . [SEP]
