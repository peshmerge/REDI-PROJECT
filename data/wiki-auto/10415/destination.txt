Emperor Kinmei (欽明天皇, Kinmei-tennō, 509–571), also written as "Kimmei", was the 29th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
His reign started in 540 and ended in 571.
Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Kinmei to be possibly legendary, but probable.
The name Kimmu"-tennō" was created for him posthumously by later generations.
The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.
Emperor Kinmei's father was Emperor Keitai and his mother was Emperor Ninken's daughter, Princess Tashiraka (手白香皇女, Tashiraka Ōjo).
He was the third son; and his older brother was Emperor Senka.
Kinmei had six wives and 25 Imperial children (16 sons and 9 daughters).
Kinmei established his court at "Shikishima no Kanazashi" (磯城嶋金刺宮) in Yamato.
Kinmei's reign was marked by the introduction of Buddhism in Japan.
The King of Kudara in Korea sent the emperor gifts of Buddhist scripture and a statue of the Buddha.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Kinmei.
According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun").
Kinmei is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.
