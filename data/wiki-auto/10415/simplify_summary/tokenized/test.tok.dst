[CLS] kin ##mei ' s contemporary title would not have been " ten ##no " , as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of emperor ten ##mu and empress ji ##to . [SEP]
[CLS] rather , it was presumably " sum ##era ##mi ##koto " or " am ##eno ##shi ##ta shi ##ros ##him ##es ##u ok ##imi " ( 治 天 下 大 王 ) , meaning " the great king who rules all under heaven " . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatively , kin ##mei might have been referred to as or the " great king of ya ##mat ##o " . [SEP]

[SEP]
