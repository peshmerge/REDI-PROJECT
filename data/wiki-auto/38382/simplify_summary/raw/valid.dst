This is a list of monarchs who ruled over East Francia, and the Kingdom of Germany ("Regnum Teutonicum"), from the division of the Frankish Empire in 843 until the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806.
The title used by the early rulers was "Rex Francorum orientalium", "King of the East Franks", or "Rex Francorum" "King of the Franks".
During the later medieval period (11th to 15th centuries), the title was "King of the Romans" ("Rex Romanorum"), and sometimes, interchangeably, "King of the Germans" ("Rex Teutonicorum").
From 1508 until 1806, "King of the Romans" continued to be used by the emperor, while "Rex Germaniae" "King of Germany" or "Rex in Germania" "King in Germany" was used by the emperor's heir-apparent.
Also listed are the heads of the various German confederations between the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire (of which Germany was a part) in 1806 until the collapse of the German Empire in 1918.
Emperors are listed in bold.
Rival kings, anti-kings, and junior co-regents are "italicized".
The title "King of the Romans", used under the Holy Roman Empire, is considered equivalent to King of Germany.
A king was chosen by the German electors and would then proceed to Rome to be crowned emperor by the pope.
