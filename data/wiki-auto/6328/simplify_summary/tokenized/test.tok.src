[CLS] in linguistics , co ##gna ##tes are words that have a common et ##ym ##ological origin . [SEP]
[CLS] co ##gna ##tes are often inherited from a shared parent language , but they may also involve borrowing ##s from some other language . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the english words " dish " and " desk " and the german word " tis ##ch " ( " table " ) are co ##gna ##tes because they all come from latin " discus " , which relates to their flat surfaces . [SEP]
[CLS] co ##gna ##tes may have evolved similar , different or even opposite meanings , but in most cases there are some similar sounds or letters in the words , in some cases appearing to be di ##ssi ##mi ##lar . [SEP]
[CLS] some words sound similar , but don ' t come from the same root ; these are called false co ##gna ##tes , while some are truly co ##gna ##te but differ in meaning ; these are called false friends . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " co ##gna ##te " derives from the latin noun " co ##gna ##tus " , which means " blood relative " . [SEP]
[CLS] co ##gna ##tes do not need to have the same meaning , which may have changed as the languages developed separately . [SEP]
[CLS] for example english " star ##ve " and dutch " ste ##r ##ven " or german " ste ##rb ##en " ( " to die " ) all derive from the same proto - germanic root , " * ste ##rba ##na " ( " die " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] " discus " is from greek " δ ##ι ##σ ##κ ##ος " ( from the verb " δ ##ι ##κ ##ε ##ι ##ν " " to throw " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a later and separate english reflex of " discus " , probably through medieval latin " des ##ca " , is " desk " ( see o ##ed s . v . " desk " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] co ##gna ##tes also do not need to have similar forms : english " father " , french " pere " , and armenian հ ##ա ##յ ##ր ( " hay ##r " ) all descend directly from proto - indo - european " * ph ##2 ##ter " . [SEP]
[CLS] an extreme case is armenian ե ##ր ##կ ##ո ##ւ ( " er ##ku " ) and english " two " , which descend from proto - indo - european " * d ##wo ##h ##1 " ( note that the sound change " * d ##w " > " er ##k " in armenian is regular ) . [SEP]
[CLS] examples of co ##gna ##tes in indo - european languages are the words " night " ( english ) , " nic ##ht " ( scots ) , " na ##cht " ( german ) , " na ##cht " ( dutch ) , " na ##g " ( afrikaans ) , " na ##ach " ( col ##og ##nian ) , " nat ##t " ( swedish , norwegian ) , " nat " ( danish ) , " nat ##t " ( far ##oese ) , " not ##t " ( icelandic ) , " no ##c " ( czech , slovak , polish ) , н ##о ##ч ##ь , " no ##ch " ( russian ) , н ##о ##к , " no ##c " ( macedonian ) , н ##о ##щ , " nos ##ht " ( bulgarian ) , " н ##і ##ч " , " nic ##h " ( ukrainian ) , " н ##о ##ч " , " no ##ch " / " no ##c " ( belarusian ) , " no ##c " ( slovene ) , " no ##c " ( bosnian , serbian , croatian ) , " nak ##ts " ( latvian ) , " nak ##tis " ( lithuanian ) , ν ##υ ##ξ , " ny ##x " ( ancient greek , " ν ##υ ##χ ##τ ##α " / " nyc ##hta " in modern greek ) , " nak ##t - " ( sanskrit ) , " nate " ( albanian ) , " nos " ( welsh , cornish ) , " no ##z " ( breton ) , " no ##x / no ##ct ##e " ( latin ) , " nu ##it " ( french ) , " no ##che " ( spanish ) , " nu ##eche " ( as ##tur ##ian ) , " no ##ite " ( portuguese and galician ) , " not ##te " ( italian ) , " ni ##t " ( catalan ) , " nu ##ech / nu ##eit " ( o ##cci ##tan ) and " no ##ap ##te " ( romanian ) , all meaning " night " and being derived from the proto - indo - european * no ##k ##wt ##s " night " . [SEP]
[CLS] another indo - european example is " star " ( english ) , " star ##n " ( scots ) , " stern " ( german ) , " ste ##r " ( dutch and afrikaans ) , " sc ##hta ##hn " ( col ##og ##nian ) , " st ##jar ##na " ( swedish ) , " st ##jer ##ne " ( norwegian and danish ) , " st ##jar ##na " ( icelandic ) , " st ##j ##ø ##rna " ( far ##oese ) , " stair ##no " ( gothic ) , " st ##r - " ( sanskrit ) , " tara " ( hindus ##tani and bengali ) , " tor ##a " ( assam ##ese ) , " set ##are " ( persian ) , " st ##oor ##ei " ( pas ##ht ##o ) , " este ##re " or " ste ##rk " ( kurdish ) , " as ##t ##gh " ( armenian ) , " α ##σ ##τ ##η ##ρ ( as ##ter ) " ( greek or " α ##σ ##τ ##ε ##ρ ##ι " / " α ##σ ##τ ##ρ ##ο " , " as ##ter ##i " / " astro " in modern greek ) , " as ##ter " ( latin ) , " as ##tre " / " et ##oi ##le " ( french ) , " astro / stella " ( italian ) , " ste ##a " ( romanian and venetian ) , " este ##l " ( catalan ) , " este ##la " ( o ##cci ##tan ) " est ##rella " and " astro " ( spanish ) , " est ##rella " ( as ##tur ##ian and leone ##se ) , " est ##rel ##a " and " astro " ( portuguese and galician ) , " ser ##en " ( welsh ) , " ste ##ren " ( cornish ) and " ste ##ren ##n " ( breton ) , from the proto - indo - european * h ##2 ##ster " star " . [SEP]
[CLS] the arabic " sal ##am " , the hebrew " sha ##lom " , the assyrian neo - aramaic " sh ##lam ##a " and the am ##hari ##c " se ##lam " ( " peace " ) are also co ##gna ##tes , derived from the proto - semitic * sal ##am - " peace " . [SEP]
[CLS] co ##gna ##tes may often be less easily recognised than the above examples , and authorities sometimes differ in their interpretations of the evidence . [SEP]
[CLS] the english word " milk " is clearly a co ##gna ##te of german " mil ##ch " , dutch " mel ##k " , russian " м ##о ##л ##о ##к ##о ( mo ##lok ##o ) " and bosnian , serbian , croatian , slovenian " ml ##ek ##o " , also montenegrin " ml ##ij ##ek ##o " . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , french " lai ##t " , catalan " ll ##et " , italian " la ##tte " , romanian " lap ##te " , spanish " le ##che " and " lei ##te " ( portuguese and galician ) ( all meaning " milk " ) are less - obvious co ##gna ##tes of ancient greek " " " gala ##kt ##os " ( gen ##itive singular of " gala " , " milk " ) , a relationship that is more evidently seen through the intermediate latin " lac " " milk " as well as the english word " lac ##tic " and other terms borrowed from latin . [SEP]
[CLS] all of them come from proto - indo - european h ##2 ##mel ##g - " milk " . [SEP]
[CLS] some co ##gna ##tes are semantic opposite ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , while the hebrew word " chu ##tz ##pa ##h " means " imp ##udence " , its classical arabic co ##gna ##te " has ##af ##ah " means " sound judgment . " [SEP]
[CLS] another example is english " empathy " " understanding of thoughts " and greek " ε ##μ ##π ##α ##θ ##ε ##ια " " malice " . [SEP]
[CLS] co ##gna ##tes within a single language , or " double ##ts " , may have meanings that are slightly or even totally different . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , english " ward " and " guard " ( [SEP]
