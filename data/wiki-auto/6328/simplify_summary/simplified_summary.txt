for example , the english words " dish " and " desk " and the german word " tisch " restroom are cognates because they all come from latin " discus " , which relates to their flat surfaces .
some words sound similar , but don ’ t come from the same root .
the word " cognate " comes from the latin word " cognatus " , which means " blood relative " .
for example , the word " starve " is used to mean " starve " , " sterven " , " sterben " , " to die " .
the word " discus " is derived from the greek " δισκειν " , meaning " to throw " .
a later and separate english reflex of " discus " , probably through medieval latin " desca " , is " desk "rned .
cognates also do not need to have similar forms : english " father " , french " pere " , and armenian հայրայրայրի " hayr " jia -lrb- " -rrb- ancestry all descend directly from proto-indo-european " * ph2ter " .
the english word " milk " is clearly a cognate of german " milch " , dutch " melk " , russian " молококоscopic moloko " " and bosnian , serbian , slovenian , slovenian , slovenian , slovenian , slovenian , " mleko " .
another example is english " understanding of thoughts " and greek " εμπαθεια " malice " .
cognates within a single language , or " doublets " , may have meanings that are slightly or even totally different .
for example , english " ward " and " guard "
