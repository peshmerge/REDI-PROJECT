For example, the English words "dish" and "desk" and the German word "Tisch" ("table") are cognates because they all come from Latin "discus", which relates to their flat surfaces.
Cognates may have evolved similar, different or even opposite meanings, but in most cases there are some similar sounds or letters in the words, in some cases appearing to be dissimilar.
The word "cognate" derives from the Latin noun "cognatus", which means "blood relative".
For example English "starve" and Dutch "sterven" or German "sterben" ("to die") all derive from the same Proto-Germanic root, "*sterbaną" ("die").
A later and separate English reflex of "discus", probably through medieval Latin "desca", is "desk" (see OED s.v.
Cognates also do not need to have similar forms: English "father", French "père", and Armenian հայր ("hayr") all descend directly from Proto-Indo-European "*ph2tḗr".
An extreme case is Armenian երկու ("erku") and English "two", which descend from Proto-Indo-European "*dwóh1" (note that the sound change "*dw" > "erk" in Armenian is regular).
The Arabic "salām", the Hebrew "shalom", the Assyrian Neo-Aramaic "shlama" and the Amharic "selam" ("peace") are also cognates, derived from the Proto-Semitic *šalām- "peace".
The English word "milk" is clearly a cognate of German "Milch", Dutch "melk", Russian "молоко (moloko)" and Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian "mleko", also Montenegrin "mlijeko".
On the other hand, French "lait", Catalan "llet", Italian "latte", Romanian "lapte", Spanish "leche" and "leite" (Portuguese and Galician) (all meaning "milk") are less-obvious cognates of Ancient Greek " " "gálaktos" (genitive singular of "gála", "milk"), a relationship that is more evidently seen through the intermediate Latin "lac" "milk" as well as the English word "lactic" and other terms borrowed from Latin.
For instance, while the Hebrew word "chutzpah" means "impudence", its Classical Arabic cognate "ḥaṣāfah" means "sound judgment."
Another example is English "empathy" "understanding of thoughts" and Greek "εμπάθεια" "malice".
Cognates within a single language, or "doublets", may have meanings that are slightly or even totally different.
