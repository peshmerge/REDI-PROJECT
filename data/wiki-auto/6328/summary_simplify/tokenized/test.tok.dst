[CLS] for example , the english words " dish " and " desk " and the german word " tis ##ch " ( " table " ) are co ##gna ##tes because they all come from latin " discus " , which relates to their flat surfaces . [SEP]
[CLS] co ##gna ##tes may have evolved similar , different or even opposite meanings , but in most cases there are some similar sounds or letters in the words , in some cases appearing to be di ##ssi ##mi ##lar . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " co ##gna ##te " derives from the latin noun " co ##gna ##tus " , which means " blood relative " . [SEP]
[CLS] for example english " star ##ve " and dutch " ste ##r ##ven " or german " ste ##rb ##en " ( " to die " ) all derive from the same proto - germanic root , " * ste ##rba ##na " ( " die " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a later and separate english reflex of " discus " , probably through medieval latin " des ##ca " , is " desk " ( see o ##ed s . v . [SEP]
[CLS] co ##gna ##tes also do not need to have similar forms : english " father " , french " pere " , and armenian հ ##ա ##յ ##ր ( " hay ##r " ) all descend directly from proto - indo - european " * ph ##2 ##ter " . [SEP]
[CLS] an extreme case is armenian ե ##ր ##կ ##ո ##ւ ( " er ##ku " ) and english " two " , which descend from proto - indo - european " * d ##wo ##h ##1 " ( note that the sound change " * d ##w " > " er ##k " in armenian is regular ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the arabic " sal ##am " , the hebrew " sha ##lom " , the assyrian neo - aramaic " sh ##lam ##a " and the am ##hari ##c " se ##lam " ( " peace " ) are also co ##gna ##tes , derived from the proto - semitic * sal ##am - " peace " . [SEP]
[CLS] the english word " milk " is clearly a co ##gna ##te of german " mil ##ch " , dutch " mel ##k " , russian " м ##о ##л ##о ##к ##о ( mo ##lok ##o ) " and bosnian , serbian , croatian , slovenian " ml ##ek ##o " , also montenegrin " ml ##ij ##ek ##o " . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , french " lai ##t " , catalan " ll ##et " , italian " la ##tte " , romanian " lap ##te " , spanish " le ##che " and " lei ##te " ( portuguese and galician ) ( all meaning " milk " ) are less - obvious co ##gna ##tes of ancient greek " " " gala ##kt ##os " ( gen ##itive singular of " gala " , " milk " ) , a relationship that is more evidently seen through the intermediate latin " lac " " milk " as well as the english word " lac ##tic " and other terms borrowed from latin . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , while the hebrew word " chu ##tz ##pa ##h " means " imp ##udence " , its classical arabic co ##gna ##te " has ##af ##ah " means " sound judgment . " [SEP]
[CLS] another example is english " empathy " " understanding of thoughts " and greek " ε ##μ ##π ##α ##θ ##ε ##ια " " malice " . [SEP]
[CLS] co ##gna ##tes within a single language , or " double ##ts " , may have meanings that are slightly or even totally different . [SEP]
