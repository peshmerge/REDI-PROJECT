[CLS] genetics is a branch of biology concerned with the study of genes , genetic variation , and here ##dity in organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] though here ##dity had been observed for millennia , gregor men ##del , a scientist and august ##inian friar working in the 19th century , was the first to study genetics scientific ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] men ##del studied " trait inheritance " , patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring . [SEP]
[CLS] he observed that organisms ( pea plants ) inherit traits by way of discrete " units of inheritance " . [SEP]
[CLS] this term , still used today , is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene . [SEP]
[CLS] trait inheritance and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century , but modern genetics has expanded beyond inheritance to studying the function and behavior of genes . [SEP]
[CLS] gene structure and function , variation , and distribution are studied within the context of the cell , the organism ( e . g . dominance ) , and within the context of a population . [SEP]
[CLS] genetics has given rise to a number of sub ##fields , including ep ##igen ##etic ##s and population genetics . [SEP]
[CLS] organisms studied within the broad field span the domains of life ( arch ##aea , bacteria , and eu ##kar ##ya ) . [SEP]
[CLS] genetic processes work in combination with an organism ' s environment and experiences to influence development and behavior , often referred to as nature versus nur ##ture . [SEP]
[CLS] the intra ##cellular or extra ##cellular environment of a cell or organism may switch gene transcription on or off . [SEP]
[CLS] a classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn , one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate . [SEP]
[CLS] while the average height of the two corn stalks may be genetically determined to be equal , the one in the arid climate only grows to half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " genetics " stems from the ancient greek " " meaning " gen ##itive " / " genera ##tive " , which in turn derives from " " meaning " origin " . [SEP]
[CLS] the observation that living things inherit traits from their parents has been used since prehistoric times to improve crop plants and animals through selective breeding . [SEP]
[CLS] the modern science of genetics , seeking to understand this process , began with the work of the august ##inian friar gregor men ##del in the mid - 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] prior to men ##del , im ##re fest ##etic ##s , a hungarian noble , who lived in ko ##sz ##eg before men ##del , was the first who used the word " genetics . " [SEP]
[CLS] he described several rules of genetic inheritance in his work " the genetic law of the nature " ( die gene ##tis ##che ge ##sat ##ze der nat ##ur , 1819 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] his second law is the same as what men ##del published . [SEP]
[CLS] in his third law , he developed the basic principles of mutation ( he can be considered a forerunner of hugo de vr ##ies ) . [SEP]
[CLS] other theories of inheritance preceded men ##del ' s work . [SEP]
[CLS] a popular theory during the 19th century , and implied by charles darwin ' s 1859 " on the origin of species " , was blending inheritance : the idea that individuals inherit a smooth blend of traits from their parents . [SEP]
[CLS] men ##del ' s work provided examples where traits were definitely not blended after hybrid ##ization , showing that traits are produced by combinations of distinct genes rather than a continuous blend . [SEP]
[CLS] blending of traits in the pro ##geny is now explained by the action of multiple genes with quantitative effects . [SEP]
[CLS] another theory that had some support at that time was the inheritance of acquired characteristics : the belief that individuals inherit traits strengthened by their parents . [SEP]
[CLS] this theory ( commonly associated with jean - baptiste lamar ##ck ) is now known to be wrong — the experiences of individuals do not affect the genes they pass to their children , although evidence in the field of ep ##igen ##etic ##s has revived some aspects of lamar ##ck ' s theory . [SEP]
[CLS] other theories included the pang ##enes ##is of charles darwin ( which had both acquired and inherited aspects ) and francis gal ##ton ' s reform ##ulation of pang ##enes ##is as both part ##iculate and inherited . [SEP]
[CLS] modern genetics started with men ##del ' s studies of the nature of inheritance in plants . [SEP]
[CLS] in his paper " " ve ##rs ##uche uber p ##fl ##an ##zen ##hy ##bri ##den " " ( " experiments on plant hybrid ##ization " ) , presented in 1865 to the " nat ##ur ##for ##schen ##der ve ##re ##in " ( society for research in nature ) in br ##un ##n , men ##del traced the inheritance patterns of certain traits in pea plants and described them mathematical ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] although this pattern of inheritance could only be observed for a few traits , men ##del ' s work suggested that here ##dity was part ##iculate , not acquired , and that the inheritance patterns of many traits could be explained through simple rules and ratios . [SEP]
[CLS] the importance of men ##del ' s work did not gain wide understanding until 1900 , after his death , when hugo de vr ##ies and other scientists rediscovered his research . [SEP]
[CLS] william bates ##on , a proponent of men ##del ' s work , coined the word " genetics " in 1905 ( the adjective " genetic " , derived from the greek word " genesis " — γ ##ε ##ν ##ε ##σ ##ι ##ς , " origin " , pre ##dates the noun and was first used in a biological sense in 1860 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] bates ##on both acted as a mentor and was aided significantly by the work of other scientists from new ##nham college at cambridge , specifically the work of becky saunders , nora darwin barlow , and muriel w ##held ##ale on ##slow . [SEP]
[CLS] bates ##on popularized the usage of the word " genetics " to describe the study of inheritance in his inaugural address to the third international conference on plant hybrid ##ization in london in 1906 . [SEP]
[CLS] after the red ##is ##co ##very of men ##del ' s work , scientists tried to determine which molecules in the cell were responsible for inheritance . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1911 , thomas hunt morgan argued that genes are on chromosomes , based on observations of a sex - linked white eye mutation in fruit flies . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1913 , his student alfred stu ##rte ##vant used the phenomenon of genetic link ##age to show that genes are arranged linear ##ly on the chromosome . [SEP]
[CLS] although genes were known to exist on chromosomes , chromosomes are composed of both protein and dna , and scientists did not know which of the two is responsible for inheritance . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1928 , frederick griffith discovered the phenomenon of transformation ( see griffith ' s experiment ) : dead bacteria could transfer genetic material to " transform " other still - living bacteria . [SEP]
[CLS] sixteen years later , in 1944 , the avery – macleod – mcc ##arty experiment identified dna as the molecule responsible for transformation . [SEP]
[CLS] the role of the nucleus as the repository of genetic information in eu ##kar ##yo ##tes had been established by hammer ##ling in 1943 in his work on the single cell ##ed al ##ga " ace ##ta ##bular ##ia " . [SEP]
[CLS] the hers ##hey – chase experiment in 1952 confirmed that dna ( rather than protein ) is the genetic material of the viruses that in ##fect bacteria , providing further evidence that dna is the molecule responsible for inheritance . [SEP]
[CLS] james watson and francis cr ##ick determined the structure of dna in 1953 , using the x - ray crystal ##log ##raphy work of rosa ##lind franklin and maurice wilkins that indicated dna has a he ##lica ##l structure ( i . e . , shaped like a cork ##sc ##rew ) . [SEP]
[CLS] their double - helix model had two strands of dna with the nu ##cle ##otide ##s pointing inward , each matching a complementary nu ##cle ##otide on the other strand to form what look like run ##gs on a twisted ladder . [SEP]
[CLS] this structure showed that genetic information exists in the sequence of nu ##cle ##otide ##s on each strand of dna . [SEP]
[CLS] the structure also suggested a simple method for replication : if the strands are separated , new partner strands can be reconstructed for each based on the sequence of the old strand . [SEP]
[CLS] this property is what gives dna its semi - conservative nature where one strand of new dna is from an original parent strand . [SEP]
[CLS] although the structure of dna showed how inheritance works , it was still not known how dna influences the behavior of cells . [SEP]
[CLS] in the following years , scientists tried to understand how dna controls the process of protein production . [SEP]
[CLS] it was discovered that the cell uses dna as a template to create matching messenger rna , molecules with nu ##cle ##otide ##s very similar to dna . [SEP]
[CLS] the nu ##cle ##otide sequence of a messenger rna is used to create an amino acid sequence in protein ; this translation between nu ##cle ##otide sequences and amino acid sequences is known as the genetic code . [SEP]
[CLS] with the newfound molecular understanding of inheritance came an explosion of research . [SEP]
[CLS] a notable theory arose from tom ##oko oh ##ta in 1973 with her amendment to the neutral theory of molecular evolution through publishing the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution . [SEP]
[CLS] in this theory , oh ##ta stressed the importance of natural selection and the environment to the rate at which genetic evolution occurs . [SEP]
[CLS] one important development was chain - termination dna sequencing in 1977 by frederick sang ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] this technology allows scientists to read the nu ##cle ##otide sequence of a dna molecule . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1983 , ka ##ry banks mu ##llis developed the polymer ##ase chain reaction , providing a quick way to isolate and amp ##li ##fy a specific section of dna from a mixture . [SEP]
[CLS] the efforts of the human genome project , department of energy , ni ##h , and parallel private efforts by ce ##ler ##a gen ##omics led to the sequencing of the human genome in 2003 . [SEP]
[CLS] at its most fundamental level , inheritance in organisms occurs by passing discrete her ##ita ##ble units , called genes , from parents to offspring . [SEP]
[CLS] this property was first observed by gregor men ##del , who studied the segregation of her ##ita ##ble traits in pea plants . [SEP]
[CLS] in his experiments studying the trait for flower color , men ##del observed that the flowers of each pea plant were either purple or white — but never an intermediate between the two colors . [SEP]
[CLS] these different , discrete versions of the same gene are called all ##eles . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of the pea , which is a dip ##loid species , each individual plant has two copies of each gene , one copy inherited from each parent . [SEP]
[CLS] many species , including humans , have this pattern of inheritance . [SEP]
[CLS] dip ##loid organisms with two copies of the same all ##ele of a given gene are called homo ##zy ##go ##us at that gene locus , while organisms with two different all ##eles of a given gene are called het ##ero ##zy ##go ##us . [SEP]
[CLS] the set of all ##eles for a given organism is called its gen ##otype , while the ob ##ser ##vable traits of the organism are called its ph ##eno ##type . [SEP]
[CLS] when organisms are het ##ero ##zy ##go ##us at a gene , often one all ##ele is called dominant as its qualities dominate the ph ##eno ##type of the organism , while the other all ##ele is called recess ##ive as its qualities rec ##ede and are not observed . [SEP]
[CLS] some all ##eles do not have complete dominance and instead have incomplete dominance by expressing an intermediate ph ##eno ##type , or cod ##omi ##nan ##ce by expressing both all ##eles at once . [SEP]
[CLS] when a pair of organisms reproduce sexually , their offspring randomly inherit one of the two all ##eles from each parent . [SEP]
[CLS] these observations of discrete inheritance and the segregation of all ##eles are collectively known as men ##del ' s first law or the law of segregation . [SEP]
[CLS] genetic ##ists use diagrams and symbols to describe inheritance . [SEP]
[CLS] a gene is represented by one or a few letters . [SEP]
[CLS] often a " + " symbol is used to mark the usual , non - mutant all ##ele for a gene . [SEP]
[CLS] in fe ##rti ##lization and breeding experiments ( and especially when discussing men ##del ' s laws ) the parents are referred to as the " p " generation and the offspring as the " f1 " ( first fi ##lia ##l ) generation . [SEP]
[CLS] when the f1 offspring mate with each other , the offspring are called the " f ##2 " ( second fi ##lia ##l ) generation . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the common diagrams used to predict the result of cross - breeding is the pun ##nett square . [SEP]
[CLS] when studying human genetic diseases , genetic ##ists often use pe ##di ##gree charts to represent the inheritance of traits . [SEP]
[CLS] these charts map the inheritance of a trait in a family tree . [SEP]
[CLS] organisms have thousands of genes , and in sexually rep ##rod ##uc ##ing organisms these genes generally ass ##ort independently of each other . [SEP]
[CLS] this means that the inheritance of an all ##ele for yellow or green pea color is unrelated to the inheritance of all ##eles for white or purple flowers . [SEP]
[CLS] this phenomenon , known as " men ##del ' s second law " or the " law of independent assortment , " means that the all ##eles of different genes get shuffled between parents to form offspring with many different combinations . [SEP]
[CLS] ( some genes do not ass ##ort independently , demonstrating genetic link ##age , a topic discussed later in this article . ) [SEP]
[CLS] often different genes can interact in a way that influences the same trait . [SEP]
[CLS] in the blue - eyed mary ( " om ##pha ##lo ##des ve ##rna " ) , for example , there exists a gene with all ##eles that determine the color of flowers : blue or mage ##nta . [SEP]
[CLS] another gene , however , controls whether the flowers have color at all or are white . [SEP]
[CLS] when a plant has two copies of this white all ##ele , its flowers are white — regardless of whether the first gene has blue or mage ##nta all ##eles . [SEP]
[CLS] this interaction between genes is called ep ##ista ##sis , with the second gene ep ##ista ##tic to the first . [SEP]
[CLS] many traits are not discrete features ( e . g . purple or white flowers ) but are instead continuous features ( e . g . human height and skin color ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these complex traits are products of many genes . [SEP]
[CLS] the influence of these genes is mediated , to varying degrees , by the environment an organism has experienced . [SEP]
[CLS] the degree to which an organism ' s genes contribute to a complex trait is called her ##ita ##bility . [SEP]
[CLS] measurement of the her ##ita ##bility of a trait is relative — in a more variable environment , the environment has a bigger influence on the total variation of the trait . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , human height is a trait with complex causes . [SEP]
[CLS] it has a her ##ita ##bility of 89 % in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] in nigeria , however , where people experience a more variable access to good nutrition and health care , height has a her ##ita ##bility of only 62 % . [SEP]
[CLS] the molecular basis for genes is de ##ox ##yr ##ib ##on ##uc ##lei ##c acid ( dna ) . [SEP]
[CLS] dna is composed of a chain of nu ##cle ##otide ##s , of which there are four types : aden ##ine ( a ) , cy ##tos ##ine ( c ) , gu ##ani ##ne ( g ) , and thy ##mine ( t ) . [SEP]
[CLS] genetic information exists in the sequence of these nu ##cle ##otide ##s , and genes exist as stretches of sequence along the dna chain . [SEP]
[CLS] viruses are the only exception to this rule — sometimes viruses use the very similar molecule rna instead of dna as their genetic material . [SEP]
[CLS] viruses cannot reproduce without a host and are unaffected by many genetic processes , so tend not to be considered living organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] dna normally exists as a double - stranded molecule , coiled into the shape of a double helix . [SEP]
[CLS] each nu ##cle ##otide in dna prefer ##ential ##ly pairs with its partner nu ##cle ##otide on the opposite strand : a pairs with t , and c pairs with g . thus , in its two - stranded form , each strand effectively contains all necessary information , redundant with its partner strand . [SEP]
[CLS] this structure of dna is the physical basis for inheritance : dna replication duplicate ##s the genetic information by splitting the strands and using each strand as a template for synthesis of a new partner strand . [SEP]
[CLS] genes are arranged linear ##ly along long chains of dna base - pair sequences . [SEP]
[CLS] in bacteria , each cell usually contains a single circular gen ##op ##hore , while eu ##kar ##yo ##tic organisms ( such as plants and animals ) have their dna arranged in multiple linear chromosomes . [SEP]
[CLS] these dna strands are often extremely long ; the largest human chromosome , for example , is about 247 million base pairs in length . [SEP]
[CLS] the dna of a chromosome is associated with structural proteins that organize , compact , and control access to the dna , forming a material called ch ##rom ##atin ; in eu ##kar ##yo ##tes , ch ##rom ##atin is usually composed of nu ##cle ##oso ##mes , segments of dna wound around cores of his ##tone proteins . [SEP]
[CLS] the full set of hereditary material in an organism ( usually the combined dna sequences of all chromosomes ) is called the genome . [SEP]
[CLS] while ha ##pl ##oid organisms have only one copy of each chromosome , most animals and many plants are dip ##loid , containing two of each chromosome and thus two copies of every gene . [SEP]
[CLS] the two all ##eles for a gene are located on identical lo ##ci of the two homo ##log ##ous chromosomes , each all ##ele inherited from a different parent . [SEP]
[CLS] many species have so - called sex chromosomes that determine the gender of each organism . [SEP]
[CLS] in humans and many other animals , the y chromosome contains the gene that triggers the development of the specifically male characteristics . [SEP]
[CLS] in evolution , this chromosome has lost most of its content and also most of its genes , while the x chromosome is similar to the other chromosomes and contains many genes . [SEP]
[CLS] the x and y chromosomes form a strongly het ##ero ##gen ##eous pair . [SEP]
[CLS] when cells divide , their full genome is copied and each daughter cell inherit ##s one copy . [SEP]
[CLS] this process , called mit ##osis , is the simplest form of reproduction and is the basis for as ##ex ##ual reproduction . [SEP]
[CLS] as ##ex ##ual reproduction can also occur in multi ##cellular organisms , producing offspring that inherit their genome from a single parent . [SEP]
[CLS] offspring that are genetically identical to their parents are called clones . [SEP]
[CLS] eu ##kar ##yo ##tic organisms often use sexual reproduction to generate offspring that contain a mixture of genetic material inherited from two different parents . [SEP]
[CLS] the process of sexual reproduction alternate ##s between forms that contain single copies of the genome ( ha ##pl ##oid ) and double copies ( dip ##loid ) . [SEP]
[CLS] ha ##pl ##oid cells fuse and combine genetic material to create a dip ##loid cell with paired chromosomes . [SEP]
[CLS] dip ##loid organisms form ha ##pl ##oids by dividing , without replica ##ting their dna , to create daughter cells that randomly inherit one of each pair of chromosomes . [SEP]
[CLS] most animals and many plants are dip ##loid for most of their lifespan , with the ha ##pl ##oid form reduced to single cell game ##tes such as sperm or eggs . [SEP]
[CLS] although they do not use the ha ##pl ##oid / dip ##loid method of sexual reproduction , bacteria have many methods of acquiring new genetic information . [SEP]
[CLS] some bacteria can undergo con ##ju ##gation , transferring a small circular piece of dna to another bacterium . [SEP]
[CLS] bacteria can also take up raw dna fragments found in the environment and integrate them into their genome ##s , a phenomenon known as transformation . [SEP]
[CLS] these processes result in horizontal gene transfer , transmitting fragments of genetic information between organisms that would be otherwise unrelated . [SEP]
[CLS] the dip ##loid nature of chromosomes allows for genes on different chromosomes to ass ##ort independently or be separated from their homo ##log ##ous pair during sexual reproduction wherein ha ##pl ##oid game ##tes are formed . [SEP]
[CLS] in this way new combinations of genes can occur in the offspring of a mating pair . [SEP]
[CLS] genes on the same chromosome would theoretically never rec ##om ##bine . [SEP]
[CLS] however , they do , via the cellular process of ch ##rom ##osomal crossover . [SEP]
[CLS] during crossover , chromosomes exchange stretches of dna , effectively shuffling the gene all ##eles between the chromosomes . [SEP]
[CLS] this process of ch ##rom ##osomal crossover generally occurs during mei ##osis , a series of cell divisions that creates ha ##pl ##oid cells . [SEP]
[CLS] the first cy ##to ##logical demonstration of crossing over was performed by harriet cr ##ei ##ghton and barbara mcc ##lin ##tock in 1931 . [SEP]
[CLS] their research and experiments on corn provided cy ##to ##logical evidence for the genetic theory that linked genes on paired chromosomes do in fact exchange places from one homo ##log to the other . [SEP]
[CLS] the probability of ch ##rom ##osomal crossover occurring between two given points on the chromosome is related to the distance between the points . [SEP]
[CLS] for an ar ##bit ##rar ##ily long distance , the probability of crossover is high enough that the inheritance of the genes is effectively un ##cor ##rel ##ated . [SEP]
[CLS] for genes that are closer together , however , the lower probability of crossover means that the genes demonstrate genetic link ##age ; all ##eles for the two genes tend to be inherited together . [SEP]
[CLS] the amounts of link ##age between a series of genes can be combined to form a linear link ##age map that roughly describes the arrangement of the genes along the chromosome . [SEP]
[CLS] genes generally express their functional effect through the production of proteins , which are complex molecules responsible for most functions in the cell . [SEP]
[CLS] proteins are made up of one or more poly ##pe ##pt ##ide chains , each of which is composed of a sequence of amino acids , and the dna sequence of a gene ( through an rna intermediate ) is used to produce a specific amino acid sequence . [SEP]
[CLS] this process begins with the production of an rna molecule with a sequence matching the gene ' s dna sequence , a process called transcription . [SEP]
[CLS] this messenger rna molecule is then used to produce a corresponding amino acid sequence through a process called translation . [SEP]
[CLS] each group of three nu ##cle ##otide ##s in the sequence , called a cod ##on , corresponds either to one of the twenty possible amino acids in a protein or an instruction to end the amino acid sequence ; this correspondence is called the genetic code . [SEP]
[CLS] the flow of information is un ##idi ##re ##ction ##al : information is transferred from nu ##cle ##otide sequences into the amino acid sequence of proteins , but it never transfers from protein back into the sequence of dna — a phenomenon francis cr ##ick called the central dog ##ma of molecular biology . [SEP]
[CLS] the specific sequence of amino acids results in a unique three - dimensional structure for that protein , and the three - dimensional structures of proteins are related to their functions . [SEP]
[CLS] some are simple structural molecules , like the fibers formed by the protein col ##lage ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] proteins can bind to other proteins and simple molecules , sometimes acting as enzymes by facilitating chemical reactions within the bound molecules ( without changing the structure of the protein itself ) . [SEP]
[CLS] protein structure is dynamic ; the protein hem ##og ##lo ##bin bends into slightly different forms as it facilitates the capture , transport , and release of oxygen molecules within mammalian blood . [SEP]
[CLS] a single nu ##cle ##otide difference within dna can cause a change in the amino acid sequence of a protein . [SEP]
[CLS] because protein structures are the result of their amino acid sequences , some changes can dramatically change the properties of a protein by des ##ta ##bil ##izing the structure or changing the surface of the protein in a way that changes its interaction with other proteins and molecules . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , sick ##le - cell an ##emia is a human genetic disease that results from a single base difference within the coding region for the β - g ##lo ##bin section of hem ##og ##lo ##bin , causing a single amino acid change that changes hem ##og ##lo ##bin ' s physical properties . [SEP]
[CLS] sick ##le - cell versions of hem ##og ##lo ##bin stick to themselves , stack ##ing to form fibers that di ##stor ##t the shape of red blood cells carrying the protein . [SEP]
[CLS] these sick ##le - shaped cells no longer flow smoothly through blood vessels , having a tendency to cl ##og or de ##grade , causing the medical problems associated with this disease . [SEP]
[CLS] some dna sequences are transcribed into rna but are not translated into protein products — such rna molecules are called non - coding rna . [SEP]
[CLS] in some cases , these products fold into structures which are involved in critical cell functions ( e . g . rib ##osomal rna and transfer rna ) . [SEP]
[CLS] rna can also have regulatory effects through hybrid ##ization interactions with other rna molecules ( e . g . micro ##rna ) . [SEP]
[CLS] although genes contain all the information an organism uses to function , the environment plays an important role in determining the ultimate ph ##eno ##type ##s an organism displays . [SEP]
[CLS] the phrase " nature and nur ##ture " refers to this complementary relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] the ph ##eno ##type of an organism depends on the interaction of genes and the environment . [SEP]
[CLS] an interesting example is the coat coloration of the siam ##ese cat . [SEP]
[CLS] in this case , the body temperature of the cat plays the role of the environment . [SEP]
[CLS] the cat ' s genes code for dark hair , thus the hair - producing cells in the cat make cellular proteins resulting in dark hair . [SEP]
[CLS] but these dark hair - producing proteins are sensitive to temperature ( i . e . have a mutation causing temperature - sensitivity ) and den ##at ##ure in higher - temperature environments , failing to produce dark - hair pigment in areas where the cat has a higher body temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] in a low - temperature environment , however , the protein ' s structure is stable and produces dark - hair pigment normally . [SEP]
[CLS] the protein remains functional in areas of skin that are colder ##su ##ch as its legs , ears , tail and faces ##o the cat has dark hair at its ex ##tre ##mit ##ies . [SEP]
[CLS] environment plays a major role in effects of the human genetic disease ph ##en ##yl ##ke ##ton ##uria . [SEP]
[CLS] the mutation that causes ph ##en ##yl ##ke ##ton ##uria disrupt ##s the ability of the body to break down the amino acid ph ##en ##yla ##lani ##ne , causing a toxic build - up of an intermediate molecule that , in turn , causes severe symptoms of progressive intellectual disability and seizures . [SEP]
[CLS] however , if someone with the ph ##en ##yl ##ke ##ton ##uria mutation follows a strict diet that avoids this amino acid , they remain normal and healthy . [SEP]
[CLS] a common method for determining how genes and environment ( " nature and nur ##ture " ) contribute to a ph ##eno ##type involves studying identical and fra ##tern ##al twins , or other siblings of multiple births . [SEP]
[CLS] identical siblings are genetically the same since they come from the same z ##y ##go ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , fra ##tern ##al twins are as genetically different from one another as normal siblings . [SEP]
[CLS] by comparing how often a certain disorder occurs in a pair of identical twins to how often it occurs in a pair of fra ##tern ##al twins , scientists can determine whether that disorder is caused by genetic or post ##nat ##al environmental factors . [SEP]
[CLS] one famous example involved the study of the gen ##ain quad ##rup ##lets , who were identical quad ##rup ##lets all diagnosed with schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] however , such tests cannot separate genetic factors from environmental factors affecting fetal development . [SEP]
[CLS] the genome of a given organism contains thousands of genes , but not all these genes need to be active at any given moment . [SEP]
[CLS] a gene is expressed when it is being transcribed into mrna and there exist many cellular methods of controlling the expression of genes such that proteins are produced only when needed by the cell . [SEP]
[CLS] transcription factors are regulatory proteins that bind to dna , either promoting or inhibit ##ing the transcription of a gene . [SEP]
[CLS] within the genome of " es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli " bacteria , for example , there exists a series of genes necessary for the synthesis of the amino acid try ##pt ##op ##han . [SEP]
[CLS] however , when try ##pt ##op ##han is already available to the cell , these genes for try ##pt ##op ##han synthesis are no longer needed . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence of try ##pt ##op ##han directly affects the activity of the genes — try ##pt ##op ##han molecules bind to the try ##pt ##op ##han rep ##ress ##or ( a transcription factor ) , changing the rep ##ress ##or ' s structure such that the rep ##ress ##or binds to the genes . [SEP]
[CLS] the try ##pt ##op ##han rep ##ress ##or blocks the transcription and expression of the genes , thereby creating negative feedback regulation of the try ##pt ##op ##han synthesis process . [SEP]
[CLS] differences in gene expression are especially clear within multi ##cellular organisms , where cells all contain the same genome but have very different structures and behaviors due to the expression of different sets of genes . [SEP]
[CLS] all the cells in a multi ##cellular organism derive from a single cell , different ##iating into variant cell types in response to external and inter ##cellular signals and gradually establishing different patterns of gene expression to create different behaviors . [SEP]
[CLS] as no single gene is responsible for the development of structures within multi ##cellular organisms , these patterns arise from the complex interactions between many cells . [SEP]
[CLS] within eu ##kar ##yo ##tes , there exist structural features of ch ##rom ##atin that influence the transcription of genes , often in the form of modifications to dna and ch ##rom ##atin that are stab ##ly inherited by daughter cells . [SEP]
[CLS] these features are called " ep ##igen ##etic " because they exist " on top " of the dna sequence and retain inheritance from one cell generation to the next . [SEP]
[CLS] because of ep ##igen ##etic features , different cell types grown within the same medium can retain very different properties . [SEP]
[CLS] although ep ##igen ##etic features are generally dynamic over the course of development , some , like the phenomenon of para ##mut ##ation , have multi ##gen ##eration ##al inheritance and exist as rare exceptions to the general rule of dna as the basis for inheritance . [SEP]
[CLS] during the process of dna replication , errors occasionally occur in the polymer ##ization of the second strand . [SEP]
[CLS] these errors , called mutations , can affect the ph ##eno ##type of an organism , especially if they occur within the protein coding sequence of a gene . [SEP]
[CLS] error rates are usually very low — 1 error in every 10 – 100 million bases — due to the " proof ##rea ##ding " ability of dna polymer ##ase ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] processes that increase the rate of changes in dna are called mu ##tage ##nic : mu ##tage ##nic chemicals promote errors in dna replication , often by interfering with the structure of base - pairing , while uv radiation induce ##s mutations by causing damage to the dna structure . [SEP]
[CLS] chemical damage to dna occurs naturally as well and cells use dna repair mechanisms to repair mis ##mat ##ches and breaks . [SEP]
[CLS] the repair does not , however , always restore the original sequence . [SEP]
[CLS] in organisms that use ch ##rom ##osomal crossover to exchange dna and rec ##om ##bine genes , errors in alignment during mei ##osis can also cause mutations . [SEP]
[CLS] errors in crossover are especially likely when similar sequences cause partner chromosomes to adopt a mistaken alignment ; this makes some regions in genome ##s more prone to mu ##tat ##ing in this way . [SEP]
[CLS] these errors create large structural changes in dna sequence ##du ##plication ##s , inversion ##s , del ##eti ##ons of entire regions ##or the accidental exchange of whole parts of sequences between different chromosomes ( ch ##rom ##osomal trans ##lo ##cation ) . [SEP]
[CLS] mutations alter an organism ' s gen ##otype and occasionally this causes different ph ##eno ##type ##s to appear . [SEP]
[CLS] most mutations have little effect on an organism ' s ph ##eno ##type , health , or reproductive fitness . [SEP]
[CLS] mutations that do have an effect are usually detrimental , but occasionally some can be beneficial . [SEP]
[CLS] studies in the fly " dr ##oso ##phila mel ##ano ##gas ##ter " suggest that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene , about 70 percent of these mutations will be harmful with the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial . [SEP]
[CLS] population genetics studies the distribution of genetic differences within populations and how these distributions change over time . [SEP]
[CLS] changes in the frequency of an all ##ele in a population are mainly influenced by natural selection , where a given all ##ele provides a selective or reproductive advantage to the organism , as well as other factors such as mutation , genetic drift , genetic hitch ##hi ##king , artificial selection and migration . [SEP]
[CLS] over many generations , the genome ##s of organisms can change significantly , resulting in evolution . [SEP]
[CLS] in the process called adaptation , selection for beneficial mutations can cause a species to evolve into forms better able to survive in their environment . [SEP]
[CLS] new species are formed through the process of spec ##iation , often caused by geographical separation ##s that prevent populations from exchanging genes with each other . [SEP]
[CLS] by comparing the homo ##logy between different species ' genome ##s , it is possible to calculate the evolutionary distance between them and when they may have diver ##ged . [SEP]
[CLS] genetic comparisons are generally considered a more accurate method of character ##izing the related ##ness between species than the comparison of ph ##eno ##typic characteristics . [SEP]
[CLS] the evolutionary distances between species can be used to form evolutionary trees ; these trees represent the common descent and diver ##gence of species over time , although they do not show the transfer of genetic material between unrelated species ( known as horizontal gene transfer and most common in bacteria ) . [SEP]
[CLS] although genetic ##ists originally studied inheritance in a wide range of organisms , researchers began to special ##ize in studying the genetics of a particular subset of organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] the fact that significant research already existed for a given organism would encourage new researchers to choose it for further study , and so eventually a few model organisms became the basis for most genetics research . [SEP]
[CLS] common research topics in model organism genetics include the study of gene regulation and the involvement of genes in development and cancer . [SEP]
[CLS] organisms were chosen , in part , for convenience — short generation times and easy genetic manipulation made some organisms popular genetics research tools . [SEP]
[CLS] widely used model organisms include the gut bacterium " es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli " , the plant " arab ##ido ##psis tha ##lian ##a " , baker ' s yeast ( " sac ##cha ##rom ##yce ##s ce ##re ##vis ##iae " ) , the ne ##mat ##ode " ca ##eno ##rh ##ab ##dit ##is el ##egan ##s " , the common fruit fly ( " dr ##oso ##phila mel ##ano ##gas ##ter " ) , and the common house mouse ( " mu ##s mu ##scu ##lus " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] medical genetics seeks to understand how genetic variation relates to human health and disease . [SEP]
[CLS] when searching for an unknown gene that may be involved in a disease , researchers commonly use genetic link ##age and genetic pe ##di ##gree charts to find the location on the genome associated with the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] at the population level , researchers take advantage of men ##del ##ian random ##ization to look for locations in the genome that are associated with diseases , a method especially useful for multi ##genic traits not clearly defined by a single gene . [SEP]
[CLS] once a candidate gene is found , further research is often done on the corresponding ( or homo ##log ##ous ) genes of model organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to studying genetic diseases , the increased availability of gen ##ot ##yp ##ing methods has led to the field of ph ##arm ##aco ##gen ##etic ##s : the study of how gen ##otype can affect drug responses . [SEP]
[CLS] individuals differ in their inherited tendency to develop cancer , and cancer is a genetic disease . [SEP]
[CLS] the process of cancer development in the body is a combination of events . [SEP]
[CLS] mutations occasionally occur within cells in the body as they divide . [SEP]
[CLS] although these mutations will not be inherited by any offspring , they can affect the behavior of cells , sometimes causing them to grow and divide more frequently . [SEP]
[CLS] there are biological mechanisms that attempt to stop this process ; signals are given to inappropriate ##ly dividing cells that should trigger cell death , but sometimes additional mutations occur that cause cells to ignore these messages . [SEP]
[CLS] an internal process of natural selection occurs within the body and eventually mutations accumulate within cells to promote their own growth , creating a cancer ##ous tumor that grows and invade ##s various tissues of the body . [SEP]
[CLS] normally , a cell divides only in response to signals called growth factors and stops growing once in contact with surrounding cells and in response to growth - inhibitor ##y signals . [SEP]
[CLS] it usually then divides a limited number of times and dies , staying within the ep ##ith ##eli ##um where it is unable to migrate to other organs . [SEP]
[CLS] to become a cancer cell , a cell has to accumulate mutations in a number of genes ( three to seven ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a cancer cell can divide without growth factor and ignores inhibitor ##y signals . [SEP]
[CLS] also , it is immortal and can grow indefinitely , even after it makes contact with neighboring cells . [SEP]
[CLS] it may escape from the ep ##ith ##eli ##um and ultimately from the primary tumor . [SEP]
[CLS] then , the escaped cell can cross the end ##oth ##eli ##um of a blood vessel and get transported by the blood ##stream to colon ##ize a new organ , forming deadly meta ##sta ##sis . [SEP]
[CLS] although there are some genetic pre ##dis ##position ##s in a small fraction of cancers , the major fraction is due to a set of new genetic mutations that originally appear and accumulate in one or a small number of cells that will divide to form the tumor and are not transmitted to the pro ##geny ( so ##matic mutations ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the most frequent mutations are a loss of function of p ##53 protein , a tumor suppress ##or , or in the p ##53 pathway , and gain of function mutations in the ras proteins , or in other on ##co ##gen ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] dna can be manipulated in the laboratory . [SEP]
[CLS] restriction enzymes are commonly used enzymes that cut dna at specific sequences , producing predictable fragments of dna . [SEP]
[CLS] dna fragments can be visual ##ized through use of gel electro ##ph ##ores ##is , which separates fragments according to their length . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of liga ##tion enzymes allows dna fragments to be connected . [SEP]
[CLS] by binding ( " liga ##ting " ) fragments of dna together from different sources , researchers can create rec ##om ##bina ##nt dna , the dna often associated with genetically modified organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] rec ##om ##bina ##nt dna is commonly used in the context of pl ##as ##mi ##ds : short circular dna molecules with a few genes on them . [SEP]
[CLS] in the process known as molecular cl ##oning , researchers can amp ##li ##fy the dna fragments by insert ##ing pl ##as ##mi ##ds into bacteria and then cult ##uring them on plates of ag ##ar ( to isolate clones of bacteria cells — " cl ##oning " can also refer to the various means of creating clone ##d ( " cl ##onal " ) organisms ) . [SEP]
[CLS] dna can also be amplified using a procedure called the polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) . [SEP]
[CLS] by using specific short sequences of dna , pc ##r can isolate and exponential ##ly amp ##li ##fy a targeted region of dna . [SEP]
[CLS] because it can amp ##li ##fy from extremely small amounts of dna , pc ##r is also often used to detect the presence of specific dna sequences . [SEP]
[CLS] dna sequencing , one of the most fundamental technologies developed to study genetics , allows researchers to determine the sequence of nu ##cle ##otide ##s in dna fragments . [SEP]
[CLS] the technique of chain - termination sequencing , developed in 1977 by a team led by frederick sang ##er , is still routinely used to sequence dna fragments . [SEP]
[CLS] using this technology , researchers have been able to study the molecular sequences associated with many human diseases . [SEP]
[CLS] as sequencing has become less expensive , researchers have sequence ##d the genome ##s of many organisms using a process called genome assembly , which utilizes computational tools to stitch together sequences from many different fragments . [SEP]
[CLS] these technologies were used to sequence the human genome in the human genome project completed in 2003 . [SEP]
[CLS] new high - through ##put sequencing technologies are dramatically lowering the cost of dna sequencing , with many researchers hoping to bring the cost of res ##e ##que ##nc ##ing a human genome down to a thousand dollars . [SEP]
[CLS] next - generation sequencing ( or high - through ##put sequencing ) came about due to the ever - increasing demand for low - cost sequencing . [SEP]
[CLS] these sequencing technologies allow the production of potentially millions of sequences concurrently . [SEP]
[CLS] the large amount of sequence data available has created the field of gen ##omics , research that uses computational tools to search for and analyze patterns in the full genome ##s of organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] gen ##omics can also be considered a sub ##field of bio ##in ##form ##atics , which uses computational approaches to analyze large sets of biological data . [SEP]
[CLS] a common problem to these fields of research is how to manage and share data that deals with human subject and personally identifiable information . [SEP]
[CLS] see also gen ##omics data sharing . [SEP]
[CLS] on 19 march 2015 , a group of leading biologist ##s urged a worldwide ban on clinical use of methods , particularly the use of crisp ##r and zinc finger , to edit the human genome in a way that can be inherited . [SEP]
[CLS] in april 2015 , chinese researchers reported results of basic research to edit the dna of non - viable human embryo ##s using crisp ##r . [SEP]
