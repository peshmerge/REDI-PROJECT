The name "organelle" comes from the idea that these structures are parts of cells, as organs are to the body, hence "organelle," the suffix "-elle" being a diminutive.
While prokaryotes do not possess organelles "per se", some do contain protein-based bacterial microcompartments, which are thought to act as primitive organelles.
The analogy of bodily organs to microscopic cellular substructures is obvious, as from even early works, authors of respective textbooks rarely elaborate on the distinction between the two.
In the 1830s, Félix Dujardin refuted Ehrenberg theory which said that microorganisms have the same organs of multicellular animals, only minor.
In a footnote, which was published as a correction in the next issue of the journal, he justified his suggestion to call organs of unicellular organisms "organella" since they are only differently formed parts of one cell, in contrast to multicellular organs of multicellular organisms.
While most cell biologists consider the term "organelle" to be synonymous with cell compartment, a space often bound by one or two lipid bilayers, some cell biologists choose to limit the term to include only those cell compartments that contain deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), having originated from formerly autonomous microscopic organisms acquired via endosymbiosis.
A second, less restrictive definition of organelles is that they are membrane-bound structures.
Therefore, the use of organelle to also refer to non-membrane bound structures such as ribosomes is common and accepted.
The mechanisms by which such non-membrane bound organelles form and retain their spatial integrity have been likened to liquid-liquid phase separation.
Eukaryotic cells are structurally complex, and by definition are organized, in part, by interior compartments that are themselves enclosed by lipid membranes that resemble the outermost cell membrane.
Exceptional organisms have cells that do not include some organelles that might otherwise be considered universal to eukaryotes (such as mitochondria).
There are also occasional exceptions to the number of membranes surrounding organelles, listed in the tables below (e.g., some that are listed as double-membrane are sometimes found with single or triple membranes).
According to the endosymbiotic theory, they are believed to have originated from incompletely consumed or invading prokaryotic organisms.
Prokaryotes are not as structurally complex as eukaryotes, and were once thought not to have any internal structures enclosed by lipid membranes.
In the past, they were often viewed as having little internal organization, but slowly, details are emerging about prokaryotic internal structures.
An early false turn was the idea developed in the 1970s that bacteria might contain membrane folds termed mesosomes, but these were later shown to be artifacts produced by the chemicals used to prepare the cells for electron microscopy.
These subcellular compartments are 100–200 nm in diameter and are enclosed by a shell of proteins.
Even more striking is the description of membrane-bound magnetosomes in bacteria, reported in 2006, as well as the nucleus-like structures of the "Planctomycetes" that are surrounded by lipid membranes, reported in 2005.
