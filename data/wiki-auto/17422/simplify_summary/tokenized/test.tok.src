[CLS] kwan ##za ##a is a celebration held in the united states and in other nations of the african diaspora in the americas and lasts a week . [SEP]
[CLS] the celebration honors african heritage in african - american culture and is observed from december 26 to january 1 , culminating in a feast and gift - giving . [SEP]
[CLS] kwan ##za ##a has seven core principles ( " ng ##uz ##o sa ##ba " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it was created by ma ##ula ##na karen ##ga and was first celebrated in 1966 – 67 . [SEP]
[CLS] american black power activist and secular humanist ma ##ula ##na karen ##ga , also known as ronald mckinley everett , created kwan ##za ##a in 1966 , as a specifically african - american holiday , in a spirit comparable to june ##tee ##nt ##h . [SEP]
[CLS] according to karen ##ga , the name kwan ##za ##a derives from the sw ##ah ##ili phrase " mat ##unda ya kwan ##za " , meaning " first fruits of the harvest " . [SEP]
[CLS] a more conventional translation would simply be " first fruits " . [SEP]
[CLS] the choice of sw ##ah ##ili , an east african language , reflects its status as a symbol of pan - african ##ism , especially in the 1960s , although most of the atlantic slave trade that brought african people to america originated in west africa . [SEP]
[CLS] first fruits festivals exist in southern africa , celebrated in december / january with the southern sol ##stic ##e , and karen ##ga was partly inspired by an account he read of the zulu festival um ##kh ##osi wo ##k ##wes ##hwa ##ma . [SEP]
[CLS] it was decided to spell the holiday ' s name with an additional " a " so that it would have a symbolic seven letters . [SEP]
[CLS] kwan ##za ##a is a celebration with its roots in the black nationalist movement of the 1960s . [SEP]
[CLS] karen ##ga established it to help african americans rec ##onne ##ct with their african cultural and historical heritage by uniting in meditation and study of african traditions and " ng ##uz ##o sa ##ba " , the " seven principles of african heritage " , which karen ##ga said " is a com ##mun ##itarian african philosophy " . [SEP]
[CLS] for karen ##ga , a major figure in the black power movement of the 1960s and 1970s , the creation of such holidays also under ##sco ##red an essential premise " you must have a cultural revolution before the violent revolution . [SEP]
[CLS] the cultural revolution gives identity , purpose and direction . " [SEP]
[CLS] during the early years of kwan ##za ##a , karen ##ga said it was meant to be an alternative to christmas . [SEP]
[CLS] he believed jesus was psychotic and christianity was a " white " religion that black people should shu ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] as kwan ##za ##a gained mainstream adherents , karen ##ga altered his position so practicing christians would not be alien ##ated , then stating in the 1997 " kwan ##za ##a : a celebration of family , community , and culture " , " kwan ##za ##a was not created to give people an alternative to their own religion or religious holiday . " [SEP]
[CLS] many african americans who celebrate kwan ##za ##a do so in addition to observing christmas . [SEP]
[CLS] kwan ##za ##a celebrates what its founder called the seven principles of kwan ##za ##a , or " ng ##uz ##o sa ##ba " ( originally " ng ##uz ##u sa ##ba " – the seven principles of african heritage ) , which karen ##ga said " is a com ##mun ##itarian african philosophy , " consisting of what karen ##ga called " the best of african thought and practice in constant exchange with the world . " [SEP]
[CLS] they were developed in 1965 , a year before kwan ##za ##a itself . [SEP]
[CLS] these seven principles comprise " ka ##wai ##da " , a sw ##ah ##ili word meaning " common " . [SEP]
[CLS] kwan ##za ##a ce ##le ##bra ##tory symbols include a mat ( mk ##eka ) on which other symbols are placed : a " kin ##ara " ( candle holder ) , " mis ##hum ##aa sa ##ba " ( seven candles ) , " ma ##za ##o " ( crops ) , " ma ##hin ##di " ( corn ) , a " ki ##ko ##mbe cha um ##oja " ( unity cup ) for commemorating and giving shu ##kra ##ni ( thanks ) to african ancestors , and " za ##wad ##i " ( gifts ) . [SEP]
[CLS] supplemental representations include a ng ##uz ##o sa ##ba poster , the black , red , and green " bender ##a " ( flag ) , and african books and artworks – all to represent values and concepts reflective of african culture and contribution to community building and reinforcement . [SEP]
[CLS] ears of corn represent the children celebrating and corn may be part of the holiday meal . [SEP]
[CLS] families celebrating kwan ##za ##a decorate their households with objects of art , colorful african cloth such as kent ##e , especially the wearing of ka ##ft ##ans by women , and fresh fruits that represent african ideal ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] it is customary to include children in kwan ##za ##a ceremonies and to give respect and gratitude to ancestors . [SEP]
[CLS] li ##bation ##s are shared , generally with a common cha ##lice , " ki ##ko ##mbe cha um ##oja " , passed around to all ce ##le ##bra ##nts . [SEP]
[CLS] non - african americans also celebrate kwan ##za ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] the holiday greeting is " joy ##ous kwan ##za ##a " . [SEP]
[CLS] a kwan ##za ##a ceremony may include drumming and musical selections , li ##bation ##s , a reading of the african pledge and the principles of blackness , reflection on the pan - african colors , a discussion of the african principle of the day or a chapter in african history , a candle - lighting ritual , artistic performance , and , finally , a feast ( kara ##mu ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the greeting for each day of kwan ##za ##a is " ha ##bari gan ##i ? " [SEP]
[CLS] which is sw ##ah ##ili for " how are you ? " [SEP]
[CLS] at first , observers of kwan ##za ##a avoided the mixing of the holiday or its symbols , values , and practice with other holidays , as doing so would violate the principle of " ku ##jic ##ha ##gul ##ia " ( self - determination ) and thus violate the integrity of the holiday , which is partially intended as a reclamation of important african values . [SEP]
[CLS] today , many african american families celebrate kwan ##za ##a along with christmas and new year ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] frequently , both christmas trees and kin ##ara ##s , the traditional candle holder symbolic of african american roots , share space in kwan ##za ##a - celebrating households . [SEP]
[CLS] for people who celebrate both holidays , kwan ##za ##a is an opportunity to incorporate elements of their particular ethnic heritage into holiday ob ##ser ##vances and celebrations of christmas . [SEP]
[CLS] cultural exhibitions include the spirit of kwan ##za ##a , an annual celebration held at the john f . kennedy center for the performing arts featuring interpret ##ive dance , african dance , song and poetry . [SEP]
[CLS] the national retail federation has sponsored a marketing survey on winter holidays since 2004 , and in 2015 found that 1 . 9 % of those polled planned to celebrate kwan ##za ##a – about six million people . [SEP]
[CLS] in a 2006 speech , ma ##ula ##na karen ##ga asserted that 28 million people celebrate kwan ##za ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] he has always claimed it is celebrated all over the world . [SEP]
[CLS] lee d . baker puts the number at 12 million . [SEP]
[CLS] the african american cultural center claimed 30 million in 2009 . [SEP]
[CLS] according to university of minnesota professor keith may ##es , the author of " kwan ##za ##a : black power and the making of the african - american holiday tradition , " the popularity within the u . s . has " leveled off " as the black power movement there has declined , and as of 2009 between 500 thousand and two million americans celebrated kwan ##za ##a , or between one and five percent of african americans . [SEP]
[CLS] may ##es added that white institutions now celebrate it . [SEP]
[CLS] starting in the 1990s , the holiday became increasingly commercial ##ized , with the first hallmark card being sold in 1992 , and there has been concern about this damaging the holiday ' s values . [SEP]
[CLS] the holiday also saw a greater public recognition as the first kwan ##za ##a stamp , designed by synth ##ia saint james , was issued by the united states post office in 1997 , and in the same year bill clinton gave the first presidential declaration marking the holiday . [SEP]
[CLS] the holiday has also spread to canada and is celebrated by black canadians in a similar fashion as in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the language portal of canada , " this fairly new tradition has also gained in popularity in france , great britain , jamaica and brazil " . [SEP]
[CLS] brazilian celebrations have been held in several cities . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##je ##pan me ##st ##rov ##ic , a sociology professor at the texas a & m university , sees kwan ##za ##a as an example of post ##mo ##dern ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] according to me ##st ##rov ##ic , post - modernist ##s in modern society may view " real " traditions as racist , sex ##ist or otherwise oppressive , but since living in a world where nothing is true is too terrifying to most people , " nice " and " synthetic " traditions like kwan ##za ##a have been created to cope with the ni ##hil ##istic , individual ##istic modern society . [SEP]
[CLS] maya angelo ##u narrated a documentary film about kwan ##za ##a , " the black candle " , written and directed by m . k . asa ##nte , jr . and featuring chuck d , graduate of goldsmith ##s university of london . [SEP]
