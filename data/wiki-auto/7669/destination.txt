A centimetre (the American spelling is centimeter, symbol cm) is a unit of length in the International System of Units (SI) measurement system.
It is equal to one hundredth of a metre.
Centi- is placed in front to say 'a hundredth'.
The centimetre is the base unit of length in the old centimetre-gram-second (CGS) system of units.
The centimetre is usually used to measure things that are too big for millimetres but too small for metres.
A centimetre is close to the length of a fingernail.
1 cubic centimetre is equal to 1 millilitre, under the SI system of units.
The centimetre has Unicode symbols so it can be written in Mandarin Chinese, Japanese and Korean characters.
They are placed into one character, and it is mostly used with East Asian fonts.
