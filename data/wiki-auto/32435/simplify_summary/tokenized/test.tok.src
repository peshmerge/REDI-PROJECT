[CLS] ve ##llum is prepared animal skin or " membrane " , typically used as a material for writing on . [SEP]
[CLS] parchment is another term for this material , and if ve ##llum is distinguished from this , it is by ve ##llum being made from calf ##skin , as opposed to that from other animals , or otherwise being of higher quality . [SEP]
[CLS] ve ##llum is prepared for writing or printing on , to produce single pages , scrolls , cod ##ices or books . [SEP]
[CLS] the word is derived from the latin word " vi ##tu ##lin ##um " meaning " made from calf " , leading to old french " ve ##lin " , " calf ##skin " . ) [SEP]
[CLS] modern scholars and cu ##sto ##dian ##s increasingly use only the less specific if confusing term " membrane " . [SEP]
[CLS] depending on factors such as the method of preparation it may be very hard to determine the animal species involved ( let alone its age ) without using a laboratory , and the term avoids the need to distinguish between ve ##llum and parchment . [SEP]
[CLS] ve ##llum is generally smooth and durable , although there are great variations depending on preparation and the quality of the skin . [SEP]
[CLS] the manufacture involves the cleaning , b ##lea ##ching , stretching on a frame ( a " hers ##e " ) , and scraping of the skin with a crescent - shaped knife ( a " lunar ##ium " or " lu ##nell ##um " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] to create tension , scraping is alternate ##d with wet ##ting and drying . [SEP]
[CLS] a final finish may be achieved by ab ##rad ##ing the surface with pu ##mic ##e , and treating with a preparation of lime or chalk to make it accept writing or printing ink . [SEP]
[CLS] modern " paper ve ##llum " is made of synthetic plant material , and is called such for its usage and quality similarities . [SEP]
[CLS] paper ve ##llum is used for a variety of purposes including tracing , technical drawings , plans and blue ##print ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in europe , from roman times , the term " ve ##llum " was used for the best quality of prepared skin , regardless of the animal from which the hide was obtained , calf , sheep , and goat all being commonly used ( other animals , including pig , deer , donkey , horse , or camel have been used ) . [SEP]
[CLS] although the term derives from the french for " calf " , animal ve ##llum can include hide from virtually any other mammal . [SEP]
[CLS] the best quality , " ut ##erine ve ##llum " , was said to be made from the skins of still ##born or un ##born animals , although the term was also applied to fine quality skins made from young animals . [SEP]
[CLS] however , there has long been much blur ##ring of the boundaries between these terms . [SEP]
[CLS] in 151 ##9 , william ho ##rman could write in his " vulgar ##ia " : " that st ##ou ##ffe that we wry ##tte upon , and is made of bees ##tis sky ##nne ##s , is so ##mt ##yme called parc ##hem ##ent , so ##mt ##yme ve ##lem , so ##mt ##yme ab ##ort ##y ##ve , so ##mt ##yme me ##mb ##ra ##an . " [SEP]
[CLS] french sources , closer to the original etymology , tend to define " ve ##lin " as from calf only , while the british standards institution defines parchment as made from the split skin of several species , and ve ##llum from the un ##sp ##lit skin . [SEP]
[CLS] in the usage of modern practitioners of the artistic crafts of writing , illuminating , lettering , and book ##bin ##ding , " ve ##llum " is normally reserved for calf ##skin , while any other skin is called " parchment " . [SEP]
[CLS] ve ##llum is a translucent material produced from the skin , often split , of a young animal . [SEP]
[CLS] the skin is washed with water and lime ( calcium hydro ##xide ) , but not together . [SEP]
[CLS] it is then soaked in lime for several days to soft ##en and remove the hair . [SEP]
[CLS] once clear , the two sides of the skin are distinct : the side facing inside the animal and the hair side . [SEP]
[CLS] the " inside body side " of the skin is usually the lighter and more refined of the two . [SEP]
[CLS] the hair f ##oll ##icles may be visible on the outer side , together with any scar ##ring made while the animal was alive . [SEP]
[CLS] the membrane can also show the pattern of the animal ' s vein network called the " vein ##ing " of the sheet . [SEP]
[CLS] any remaining hair is removed ( " sc ##uddin ##g " ) and the skin is dried by attach ##ing it to a frame ( a " hers ##e " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the skin is attached at points around the ci ##rc ##um ##ference with cords ; to prevent tearing , the maker wraps the area of the skin to which the cord is to be attached around a pe ##bble ( a " pip ##pin " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the maker then uses a crescent shaped knife , ( a " lunar ##ium " or " lu ##nell ##um " ) , to clean off any remaining hairs . [SEP]
[CLS] once the skin is completely dry , it is thoroughly cleaned and processed into sheets . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of sheets extracted from the piece of skin depends on the size of the skin and the given dimensions requested by the order . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the average calf ##skin can provide three and half medium sheets of writing material . [SEP]
[CLS] this can be doubled when it is folded into two con ##jo ##int leaves , also known as a bi ##fo ##lium . [SEP]
[CLS] historians have found evidence of manuscripts where the scribe wrote down the medieval instructions now followed by modern membrane makers . [SEP]
[CLS] the membrane is then rubbed with a round , flat object ( " po ##un ##cing " ) to ensure that the ink would adhere well . [SEP]
[CLS] once the ve ##llum is prepared , traditionally a qui ##re is formed of a group of several sheets . [SEP]
[CLS] raymond clemens and timothy graham point out , in their " introduction to manuscript studies " , that " the qui ##re was the scribe ' s basic writing unit throughout the middle ages " . [SEP]
[CLS] guidelines are then made on the membrane . [SEP]
[CLS] they note " ' prick ##ing ' is the process of making holes in a sheet of parchment ( or membrane ) in preparation of its ruling . [SEP]
[CLS] the lines were then made by ruling between the prick marks . . . the process of entering ruled lines on the page to serve as a guide for entering text . [SEP]
[CLS] most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baseline ##s on which the text was entered and with vertical bound ##ing lines that marked the boundaries of the columns " . [SEP]
[CLS] most of the finer sort of medieval manuscripts , whether illuminated or not , were written on ve ##llum . [SEP]
[CLS] some gan ##dhar ##an buddhist texts were written on ve ##llum , and all si ##fr ##ei torah ( hebrew : ס ##פ ##ר ת ##ו ##ר ##ה se ##fer torah ; plural : ס ##פ ##ר ##י ת ##ו ##ר ##ה , si ##fr ##ei torah ) are written on ko ##sher k ##la ##f or ve ##llum . [SEP]
[CLS] a quarter of the 180 copy edition of johannes gut ##enberg ' s first bible printed in 145 ##5 with mo ##vable type was also printed on ve ##llum , presumably because his market expected this for a high - quality book . [SEP]
[CLS] paper was used for most book - printing , as it was cheaper and easier to process through a printing press and bind . [SEP]
[CLS] in art , ve ##llum was used for paintings , especially if they needed to be sent long distances , before canvas became widely used in about 1500 , and continued to be used for drawings , and water ##col ##ours . [SEP]
[CLS] old master prints were sometimes printed on ve ##llum , especially for presentation copies , until at least the seventeenth century . [SEP]
[CLS] limp ve ##llum or limp - parchment binding ##s were used frequently in the 16th and 17th centuries , and were sometimes gil ##t but were also often not em ##bell ##ished . [SEP]
[CLS] in later centuries ve ##llum has been more commonly used like leather , that is , as the covering for stiff board binding ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ve ##llum can be stained virtually any color but seldom is , as a great part of its beauty and appeal rests in its faint grain and hair markings , as well as its warmth and simplicity . [SEP]
[CLS] lasting in excess of 1 , 000 years — gregory the great , pastoral care ( troy ##es , bi ##bl ##iot ##he ##que municipal ##e , ms 50 ##4 ) , for example dates from about 600 and is in excellent condition — animal ve ##llum can be far more durable than paper . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , many important documents are written on animal ve ##llum , such as diploma ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] referring to a diploma as a " sheep ##skin " all ##udes to the time when diploma ##s were written on ve ##llum made from animal hides . [SEP]
[CLS] british acts of parliament are still printed on ve ##llum for archival purposes , as are those of the republic of ireland . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 2016 , the uk house of lords announced that legislation would be printed on archive paper instead of the traditional ve ##llum from april 2016 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , cabinet office minister matthew hancock intervened by agreeing to fund the continued use of ve ##llum from the cabinet office budget . [SEP]
[CLS] today , because of low demand and complicated manufacturing process , animal ve ##llum is expensive and hard to find . [SEP]
[CLS] the only uk company still producing traditional parchment and ve ##llum is william cow ##ley ( established 1870 ) , which is based in newport pa ##gne ##ll , buckinghamshire . [SEP]
[CLS] a modern imitation is made of cotton . [SEP]
[CLS] known as paper ve ##llum , this material is considerably cheaper than animal ve ##llum and can be found in most art and drafting supply stores . [SEP]
[CLS] some brands of writing paper and other sorts of paper use the term " ve ##llum " to suggest quality . [SEP]
[CLS] ve ##llum is still used for jewish scrolls , of the torah in particular , for luxury book - binding , memorial books , and for various documents in call ##igraphy . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also used on instruments such as the banjo and the bo ##dh ##ran , although synthetic skins are also available for these instruments . [SEP]
[CLS] modern imitation ve ##llum is made from plastic ##ized rag cotton or fibers from interior tree bark . [SEP]
[CLS] terms include : paper ve ##llum , japanese ve ##llum , and vegetable ve ##llum . [SEP]
[CLS] paper ve ##llum is usually translucent and its various sizes are often used in applications where tracing is required , such as architectural plans . [SEP]
[CLS] it is more dimensional ##ly stable than a linen or paper sheet , which is frequently critical in the development of large scaled drawings such as blue ##print ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] paper ve ##llum had also become extremely important in hand or chemical reproduction technology for dissemination of plan copies . [SEP]
[CLS] like a high - quality traditional ve ##llum , paper ve ##llum could be produced thin enough to be virtually transparent to strong light , enabling a source drawing to be used directly in the reproduction of field - used drawings . [SEP]
[CLS] ve ##llum is ideally stored in a stable environment with constant temperature and 30 % ( ± 5 % ) relative humidity . [SEP]
[CLS] if ve ##llum is stored in an environment with less than 11 % relative humidity , it becomes fragile , brittle , and susceptible to mechanical stresses ; if it is stored in an environment with greater than 40 % relative humidity , it becomes vulnerable to gel ##ation and to mold or fungus growth . [SEP]
[CLS] the optimal temperature for the preservation of ve ##llum is 20 + / - . [SEP]
