Many intermediate states are known to exist, such as liquid crystal, and some states only exist under extreme conditions, such as Bose–Einstein condensates, neutron-degenerate matter, and quark–gluon plasma, which only occur, respectively, in situations of extreme cold, extreme density, and extremely high energy.
Historically, the distinction is made based on qualitative differences in properties.
Matter in the solid state maintains a fixed volume and shape, with component particles (atoms, molecules or ions) close together and fixed into place.
Matter in the liquid state maintains a fixed volume, but has a variable shape that adapts to fit its container.
Matter in the gaseous state has both variable volume and shape, adapting both to fit its container.
Its particles are neither close together nor fixed in place.
Matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape, and contains neutral atoms as well as a significant number of ions and electrons, both of which can move around freely.
The term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter, but a system can contain several immiscible phases of the same state of matter.
In a solid, constituent particles (ions, atoms, or molecules) are closely packed together.
The forces between particles are so strong that the particles cannot move freely but can only vibrate.
Solids can only change their shape by force, as when broken or cut.
For example, iron has a body-centred cubic structure at temperatures below 912 C , and a face-centred cubic structure between 912 and 1394 C .
Ice has fifteen known crystal structures, or fifteen solid phases, which exist at various temperatures and pressures.
Glasses and other non-crystalline, amorphous solids without long-range order are not thermal equilibrium ground states; therefore they are described below as nonclassical states of matter.
Solids can also change directly into gases through the process of sublimation, and gases can likewise change directly into solids through deposition.
A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure.
When a solid is heated above its melting point, it becomes liquid, given that the pressure is higher than the triple point of the substance.
Intermolecular (or interatomic or interionic) forces are still important, but the molecules have enough energy to move relative to each other and the structure is mobile.
The volume is usually greater than that of the corresponding solid, the best known exception being water, H O.
In a gas, the molecules have enough kinetic energy so that the effect of intermolecular forces is small (or zero for an ideal gas), and the typical distance between neighboring molecules is much greater than the molecular size.
A gas has no definite shape or volume, but occupies the entire container in which it is confined.
A liquid may be converted to a gas by heating at constant pressure to the boiling point, or else by reducing the pressure at constant temperature.
At temperatures below its critical temperature, a gas is also called a vapor, and can be liquefied by compression alone without cooling.
A supercritical fluid has the physical properties of a gas, but its high density confers solvent properties in some cases, which leads to useful applications.
Positively charged nuclei swim in a "sea" of freely-moving disassociated electrons, similar to the way such charges exist in conductive metal, where this electron "sea" allows matter in the plasma state to conduct electricity.
A gas is usually converted to a plasma in one of two ways, e.g., either from a huge voltage difference between two points, or by exposing it to extremely high temperatures.
At very high temperatures, such as those present in stars, it is assumed that essentially all electrons are "free", and that a very high-energy plasma is essentially bare nuclei swimming in a sea of electrons.
The plasma state is often misunderstood, and although not freely existing under normal conditions on Earth, it is quite commonly generated by either lightning, electric sparks, fluorescent lights, neon lights or in plasma televisions.
The Sun's corona, some types of flame, and stars are all examples of illuminated matter in the plasma state.
A state of matter is also characterized by phase transitions.
Water can be said to have several distinct solid states.
Such phases have been exploited by the introduction of liquid crystal technology.
The state or "phase" of a given set of matter can change depending on pressure and temperature conditions, transitioning to other phases as these conditions change to favor their existence; for example, solid transitions to liquid with an increase in temperature.
As heat is added to this substance it melts into a liquid at its melting point, boils into a gas at its boiling point, and if heated high enough would enter a plasma state in which the electrons are so energized that they leave their parent atoms.
Matter in the plasma state is seldom used (if at all) in chemical equations, so there is no standard symbol to denote it.
Glass is a non-crystalline or amorphous solid material that exhibits a glass transition when heated towards the liquid state.
Thermodynamically, a glass is in a metastable state with respect to its crystalline counterpart.
A plastic crystal is a molecular solid with long-range positional order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom; in an orientational glass this degree of freedom is frozen in a quenched disordered state.
For example, the nematic phase consists of long rod-like molecules such as para-azoxyanisole, which is nematic in the temperature range 118–136 C .
In this state the molecules flow as in a liquid, but they all point in the same direction (within each domain) and cannot rotate freely.
Other types of liquid crystals are described in the main article on these states.
Transition metal atoms often have magnetic moments due to the net spin of electrons that remain unpaired and do not form chemical bonds.
If the domains are also aligned, the solid is a permanent magnet, which is magnetic even in the absence of an external magnetic field.
The magnetization disappears when the magnet is heated to the Curie point, which for iron is 768 C .
An antiferromagnet has two networks of equal and opposite magnetic moments, which cancel each other out so that the net magnetization is zero.
For example, in nickel(II) oxide (NiO), half the nickel atoms have moments aligned in one direction and half in the opposite direction.
In a ferrimagnet, the two networks of magnetic moments are opposite but unequal, so that cancellation is incomplete and there is a non-zero net magnetization.
A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is a disordered state in a system of interacting quantum spins which preserves its disorder to very low temperatures, unlike other disordered states.
It is not a liquid in physical sense, but a solid whose magnetic order is inherently disordered.
A QSL is neither a ferromagnet, where magnetic domains are parallel, nor an antiferromagnet, where the magnetic domains are antiparallel; instead, the magnetic domains are randomly oriented.
When cooling down and settling to a state, the domain must "choose" an orientation, but if the possible states are similar in energy, one will be chosen randomly.
Copolymers can undergo microphase separation to form a diverse array of periodic nanostructures, as shown in the example of the styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer shown at right.
Microphase separation can be understood by analogy to the phase separation between oil and water.
However, because the blocks are covalently bonded to each other, they cannot demix macroscopically as water and oil can, and so instead the blocks form nanometer-sized structures.
Depending on the relative lengths of each block and the overall block topology of the polymer, many morphologies can be obtained, each its own phase of matter.
The anion and cation are not necessarily compatible and would demix otherwise, but electric charge attraction prevents them from separating.
Their anions and cations appear to diffuse within compartmentalized layers or micelles instead of freely as in a uniform liquid.
