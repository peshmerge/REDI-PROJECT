[CLS] many intermediate states are known to exist , such as liquid crystal , and some states only exist under extreme conditions , such as bose – einstein conde ##ns ##ates , neutron - de ##gen ##erate matter , and qu ##ark – g ##lu ##on plasma , which only occur , respectively , in situations of extreme cold , extreme density , and extremely high energy . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , the distinction is made based on qu ##ali ##tative differences in properties . [SEP]
[CLS] matter in the solid state maintains a fixed volume and shape , with component particles ( atoms , molecules or ions ) close together and fixed into place . [SEP]
[CLS] matter in the liquid state maintains a fixed volume , but has a variable shape that adapt ##s to fit its container . [SEP]
[CLS] matter in the gas ##eous state has both variable volume and shape , adapting both to fit its container . [SEP]
[CLS] its particles are neither close together nor fixed in place . [SEP]
[CLS] matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape , and contains neutral atoms as well as a significant number of ions and electrons , both of which can move around freely . [SEP]
[CLS] the term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter , but a system can contain several im ##mis ##ci ##ble phases of the same state of matter . [SEP]
[CLS] in a solid , constituent particles ( ions , atoms , or molecules ) are closely packed together . [SEP]
[CLS] the forces between particles are so strong that the particles cannot move freely but can only vi ##brate . [SEP]
[CLS] solids can only change their shape by force , as when broken or cut . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , iron has a body - centred cubic structure at temperatures below 91 ##2 c , and a face - centred cubic structure between 91 ##2 and 139 ##4 c . [SEP]
[CLS] ice has fifteen known crystal structures , or fifteen solid phases , which exist at various temperatures and pressures . [SEP]
[CLS] glasses and other non - crystalline , amor ##ph ##ous solids without long - range order are not thermal equilibrium ground states ; therefore they are described below as non ##class ##ical states of matter . [SEP]
[CLS] solids can also change directly into gases through the process of sub ##lim ##ation , and gases can likewise change directly into solids through deposition . [SEP]
[CLS] a liquid is a nearly inc ##omp ##ress ##ible fluid that conform ##s to the shape of its container but retains a ( nearly ) constant volume independent of pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] when a solid is heated above its melting point , it becomes liquid , given that the pressure is higher than the triple point of the substance . [SEP]
[CLS] inter ##mo ##le ##cular ( or inter ##ato ##mic or inter ##ion ##ic ) forces are still important , but the molecules have enough energy to move relative to each other and the structure is mobile . [SEP]
[CLS] the volume is usually greater than that of the corresponding solid , the best known exception being water , h o . [SEP]
[CLS] in a gas , the molecules have enough kinetic energy so that the effect of inter ##mo ##le ##cular forces is small ( or zero for an ideal gas ) , and the typical distance between neighboring molecules is much greater than the molecular size . [SEP]
[CLS] a gas has no definite shape or volume , but occupies the entire container in which it is confined . [SEP]
[CLS] a liquid may be converted to a gas by heating at constant pressure to the boiling point , or else by reducing the pressure at constant temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] at temperatures below its critical temperature , a gas is also called a vapor , and can be li ##que ##fied by compression alone without cooling . [SEP]
[CLS] a super ##cr ##itical fluid has the physical properties of a gas , but its high density con ##fers solvent properties in some cases , which leads to useful applications . [SEP]
[CLS] positively charged nuclei swim in a " sea " of freely - moving di ##sas ##so ##cia ##ted electrons , similar to the way such charges exist in conduct ##ive metal , where this electron " sea " allows matter in the plasma state to conduct electricity . [SEP]
[CLS] a gas is usually converted to a plasma in one of two ways , e . g . , either from a huge voltage difference between two points , or by exposing it to extremely high temperatures . [SEP]
[CLS] at very high temperatures , such as those present in stars , it is assumed that essentially all electrons are " free " , and that a very high - energy plasma is essentially bare nuclei swimming in a sea of electrons . [SEP]
[CLS] the plasma state is often misunderstood , and although not freely existing under normal conditions on earth , it is quite commonly generated by either lightning , electric sparks , fluorescent lights , neon lights or in plasma television ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the sun ' s corona , some types of flame , and stars are all examples of illuminated matter in the plasma state . [SEP]
[CLS] a state of matter is also characterized by phase transitions . [SEP]
[CLS] water can be said to have several distinct solid states . [SEP]
[CLS] such phases have been exploited by the introduction of liquid crystal technology . [SEP]
[CLS] the state or " phase " of a given set of matter can change depending on pressure and temperature conditions , transition ##ing to other phases as these conditions change to favor their existence ; for example , solid transitions to liquid with an increase in temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] as heat is added to this substance it melt ##s into a liquid at its melting point , boil ##s into a gas at its boiling point , and if heated high enough would enter a plasma state in which the electrons are so en ##er ##gi ##zed that they leave their parent atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] matter in the plasma state is seldom used ( if at all ) in chemical equations , so there is no standard symbol to denote it . [SEP]
[CLS] glass is a non - crystalline or amor ##ph ##ous solid material that exhibits a glass transition when heated towards the liquid state . [SEP]
[CLS] the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mic ##ally , a glass is in a meta ##sta ##ble state with respect to its crystalline counterpart . [SEP]
[CLS] a plastic crystal is a molecular solid with long - range position ##al order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom ; in an orientation ##al glass this degree of freedom is frozen in a que ##nched disorder ##ed state . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the ne ##matic phase consists of long rod - like molecules such as para - az ##ox ##yan ##iso ##le , which is ne ##matic in the temperature range 118 – 136 c . [SEP]
[CLS] in this state the molecules flow as in a liquid , but they all point in the same direction ( within each domain ) and cannot rotate freely . [SEP]
[CLS] other types of liquid crystals are described in the main article on these states . [SEP]
[CLS] transition metal atoms often have magnetic moments due to the net spin of electrons that remain un ##pa ##ired and do not form chemical bonds . [SEP]
[CLS] if the domains are also aligned , the solid is a permanent magnet , which is magnetic even in the absence of an external magnetic field . [SEP]
[CLS] the magnet ##ization disappears when the magnet is heated to the cu ##rie point , which for iron is 76 ##8 c . [SEP]
[CLS] an anti ##fer ##rom ##agne ##t has two networks of equal and opposite magnetic moments , which cancel each other out so that the net magnet ##ization is zero . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in nickel ( ii ) oxide ( ni ##o ) , half the nickel atoms have moments aligned in one direction and half in the opposite direction . [SEP]
[CLS] in a fe ##rri ##ma ##gne ##t , the two networks of magnetic moments are opposite but une ##qual , so that cancellation is incomplete and there is a non - zero net magnet ##ization . [SEP]
[CLS] a quantum spin liquid ( q ##sl ) is a disorder ##ed state in a system of interacting quantum spins which preserves its disorder to very low temperatures , unlike other disorder ##ed states . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not a liquid in physical sense , but a solid whose magnetic order is inherently disorder ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] a q ##sl is neither a fe ##rro ##ma ##gne ##t , where magnetic domains are parallel , nor an anti ##fer ##rom ##agne ##t , where the magnetic domains are anti ##para ##lle ##l ; instead , the magnetic domains are randomly oriented . [SEP]
[CLS] when cooling down and settling to a state , the domain must " choose " an orientation , but if the possible states are similar in energy , one will be chosen randomly . [SEP]
[CLS] cop ##ol ##yme ##rs can undergo micro ##pha ##se separation to form a diverse array of periodic nano ##st ##ru ##cture ##s , as shown in the example of the st ##yre ##ne - but ##adi ##ene - st ##yre ##ne block cop ##ol ##yme ##r shown at right . [SEP]
[CLS] micro ##pha ##se separation can be understood by analogy to the phase separation between oil and water . [SEP]
[CLS] however , because the blocks are co ##valent ##ly bonded to each other , they cannot demi ##x macro ##scopic ##ally as water and oil can , and so instead the blocks form nano ##meter - sized structures . [SEP]
[CLS] depending on the relative lengths of each block and the overall block topology of the polymer , many mor ##ph ##ologies can be obtained , each its own phase of matter . [SEP]
[CLS] the an ##ion and cat ##ion are not necessarily compatible and would demi ##x otherwise , but electric charge attraction prevents them from separating . [SEP]
[CLS] their an ##ions and cat ##ions appear to diffuse within compartment ##ali ##zed layers or mice ##lles instead of freely as in a uniform liquid . [SEP]
