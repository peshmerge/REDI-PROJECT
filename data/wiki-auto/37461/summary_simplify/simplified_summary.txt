some states only exist under extreme conditions , such as bose – einstein condensates , neutron-degenerate matter , and quark – gluon plasma , respectively , in situations of extreme cold , extreme cold , extreme density , and extremely high energy .
historically , the distinction is made based on qualitative differences in properties .
matter in the solid state is fixed in a fixed volume and shape .
matter in the liquid state is a fixed volume , but has a variable shape that adapts to fit its container .
matter in the gaseous state is different from the shape of a container .
the particles are neither close together nor fixed in place .
matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape .
the term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter , but a system can contain several immiscible phases of the same state of matter .
in a solid , atoms , or molecules nanometres are closely packed together .
the forces between particles are so strong that the particles particles particles particles particles particles particles particles particles particlesstrel , but can only vibrate .
solids can only change their shape by force , as when broken or cut .
for example , iron has a body-centred cubic structure at temperatures below 912 ° c , and a face-centred cubic structure between 912 and 1394 c .
ice has fifteen known crystal structures , or fifteen solid phases , which exist at various temperatures and pressures .
glasses and other non-crystalline , amorphous solids without long range order are not thermal equilibrium ground states .
gases can likewise change directly into solids through the process of sublimation .
a liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that is similar to the shape of its container but retains a ( nearly unchanged constant volume independent of pressure .
when a solid is heated above its melting point , it becomes liquid .
intermolecular interaction is a branch of applied mathematics , but the molecules have enough energy to move relative to each other and the structure is mobile .
the volume is usually greater than that of the corresponding solid .
in a gas , the molecules have enough kinetic energy so that the effect of intermolecular forces is smallrfordably or zero for an ideal gaseous gaseous molecules .
a gas has no definite shape or volume .
a liquid can be converted to a gas by heating at constant pressure to the boiling point .
at temperatures below its critical temperature , a gas is also called a vapor .
a supercritical fluid has the physical properties of a gas , but its high density confers solvent properties in some cases , which leads to useful applications .
positively charged nuclei swim in a " sea " of freely-moving disassociated electrons .
a gas is converted to plasma in one of two ways .
at very high temperatures , such as those present in stars , it is assumed that essentially all electrons are free , and that a very high-energy plasma is essentially bare nuclei swimming in a sea of electrons .
the plasma state is often misunderstood , and it is made up mostly by lightning , electric sparks , fluorescent lights , neon lights , or in plasma televisions .
the corona , some types of stars , and stars are all examples of illuminated matter in the plasma state .
a state of matter is also characterized by phase transitions .
water is said to have several different solid states .
such phases have been exploited by the introduction of liquid crystal technology .
the state of matter can change depending on pressure and temperature conditions .
it melts into a liquid at its melting point .
matter in the plasma state is seldom used whenever at allosis in chemical equations , so there is no standard symbol to denote it .
glass is a non-crystalline or amorphous solid material that exhibits a glass transition when heated towards the liquid state .
thermodynamically , a glass is in a metastable state with respect to its crystalline counterpart .
a plastic crystal is a molecule with long range positional order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom ; in an orientational glass this degree of freedom is frozen in a quenched disordered state .
for example , the nematic phase has long rod-like molecules such as para-azoxyanisole , which is nematic in the temperature range 118-136 ° c .
in this state the molecules flow as in a liquid .
there are other types of liquid crystals .
transition metal atoms often have magnetic moments due to the net spin of electrons that remain unpaired and do not form chemical bonds .
if the domains are also aligned , the solid is a permanent magnet , which is magnetic even in the absence of an external magnetic field .
the magnetization disappears when the magnet is heated to the curie point .
an antiferromagnet has two networks of equal and opposite magnetic moments , which cancel out so that the net magnetization is zero .
for example , in nickelnhead oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide oxide nickel nickel nickel nickel nickel nickel nickel nickel nickel nickel nickelous nio ¥ , half the nickel atoms have moments aligned in one direction and half in the opposite direction .
in a ferrimagnet , the two networks of magnetic moments are opposite but unequal .
a quantum spin liquid is a disordered state in a system of interacting quantum spins .
it is not a liquid in physical sense , but a solid whose magnetic order is inherently disordered .
a qsl is neither a ferromagnet , where magnetic domains are parallel , nor an antiferromagnet , where the magnetic domains are antiparallel ; instead , the magnetic domains are randomly oriented .
when cooling down and settling to a state , the domain must " choose " an orientation , but if the possible states are similar in energy , one will be chosen randomly .
copolymers can undergo microphase separation to form a diverse array of periodic nanostructures , as shown in the example of the styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer shown at right .
microphase separation is the opposite of the phase separation between oil and water .
instead , the blocks form nanometer-sized structures .
depending on the relative lengths of each block and the overall block topology of the polymer , many morphologies can be obtained , each its own phase of matter .
the anion and cation are not necessarily compatible , and would demix otherwise , but electric charge attraction prevents them from separating .
the anions and cations appear to diffuse in layers or micelles instead of freely as in a uniform liquid .
