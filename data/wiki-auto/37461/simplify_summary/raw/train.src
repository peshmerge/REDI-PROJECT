In physics, a state of matter is one of the distinct forms in which matter can exist.
Four states of matter are observable in everyday life: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma.
Many intermediate states are known to exist, such as liquid crystal, and some states only exist under extreme conditions, such as Bose–Einstein condensates, neutron-degenerate matter, and quark–gluon plasma, which only occur, respectively, in situations of extreme cold, extreme density, and extremely high energy.
For a complete list of all exotic states of matter, see the list of states of matter.
Historically, the distinction is made based on qualitative differences in properties.
Matter in the solid state maintains a fixed volume and shape, with component particles (atoms, molecules or ions) close together and fixed into place.
Matter in the liquid state maintains a fixed volume, but has a variable shape that adapts to fit its container.
Its particles are still close together but move freely.
Matter in the gaseous state has both variable volume and shape, adapting both to fit its container.
Its particles are neither close together nor fixed in place.
Matter in the plasma state has variable volume and shape, and contains neutral atoms as well as a significant number of ions and electrons, both of which can move around freely.
The term phase is sometimes used as a synonym for state of matter, but a system can contain several immiscible phases of the same state of matter.
In a solid, constituent particles (ions, atoms, or molecules) are closely packed together.
The forces between particles are so strong that the particles cannot move freely but can only vibrate.
As a result, a solid has a stable, definite shape, and a definite volume.
Solids can only change their shape by force, as when broken or cut.
In crystalline solids, the particles (atoms, molecules, or ions) are packed in a regularly ordered, repeating pattern.
There are various different crystal structures, and the same substance can have more than one structure (or solid phase).
For example, iron has a body-centred cubic structure at temperatures below 912 C , and a face-centred cubic structure between 912 and 1394 C .
Ice has fifteen known crystal structures, or fifteen solid phases, which exist at various temperatures and pressures.
Glasses and other non-crystalline, amorphous solids without long-range order are not thermal equilibrium ground states; therefore they are described below as nonclassical states of matter.
Solids can be transformed into liquids by melting, and liquids can be transformed into solids by freezing.
Solids can also change directly into gases through the process of sublimation, and gases can likewise change directly into solids through deposition.
A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure.
The volume is definite if the temperature and pressure are constant.
When a solid is heated above its melting point, it becomes liquid, given that the pressure is higher than the triple point of the substance.
Intermolecular (or interatomic or interionic) forces are still important, but the molecules have enough energy to move relative to each other and the structure is mobile.
This means that the shape of a liquid is not definite but is determined by its container.
The volume is usually greater than that of the corresponding solid, the best known exception being water, H O.
The highest temperature at which a given liquid can exist is its critical temperature.
A gas is a compressible fluid.
Not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container.
In a gas, the molecules have enough kinetic energy so that the effect of intermolecular forces is small (or zero for an ideal gas), and the typical distance between neighboring molecules is much greater than the molecular size.
A gas has no definite shape or volume, but occupies the entire container in which it is confined.
A liquid may be converted to a gas by heating at constant pressure to the boiling point, or else by reducing the pressure at constant temperature.
At temperatures below its critical temperature, a gas is also called a vapor, and can be liquefied by compression alone without cooling.
A vapor can exist in equilibrium with a liquid (or solid), in which case the gas pressure equals the vapor pressure of the liquid (or solid).
A supercritical fluid (SCF) is a gas whose temperature and pressure are above the critical temperature and critical pressure respectively.
In this state, the distinction between liquid and gas disappears.
A supercritical fluid has the physical properties of a gas, but its high density confers solvent properties in some cases, which leads to useful applications.
For example, supercritical carbon dioxide is used to extract caffeine in the manufacture of decaffeinated coffee.
Like a gas, plasma does not have definite shape or volume.
Unlike gases, plasmas are electrically conductive, produce magnetic fields and electric currents, and respond strongly to electromagnetic forces.
Positively charged nuclei swim in a "sea" of freely-moving disassociated electrons, similar to the way such charges exist in conductive metal, where this electron "sea" allows matter in the plasma state to conduct electricity.
A gas is usually converted to a plasma in one of two ways, e.g., either from a huge voltage difference between two points, or by exposing it to extremely high temperatures.
Heating matter to high temperatures causes electrons to leave the atoms, resulting in the presence of free electrons.
This creates a so-called partially ionised plasma.
At very high temperatures, such as those present in stars, it is assumed that essentially all electrons are "free", and that a very high-energy plasma is essentially bare nuclei swimming in a sea of electrons.
This forms the so-called fully ionised plasma.
The plasma state is often misunderstood, and although not freely existing under normal conditions on Earth, it is quite commonly generated by either lightning, electric sparks, fluorescent lights, neon lights or in plasma televisions.
The Sun's corona, some types of flame, and stars are all examples of illuminated matter in the plasma state.
A state of matter is also characterized by phase transitions.
A phase transition indicates a change in structure and can be recognized by an abrupt change in properties.
A distinct state of matter can be defined as any set of states distinguished from any other set of states by a phase transition.
Water can be said to have several distinct solid states.
The appearance of superconductivity is associated with a phase transition, so there are superconductive states.
Likewise, ferromagnetic states are demarcated by phase transitions and have distinctive properties.
When the change of state occurs in stages the intermediate steps are called mesophases.
Such phases have been exploited by the introduction of liquid crystal technology.
The state or "phase" of a given set of matter can change depending on pressure and temperature conditions, transitioning to other phases as these conditions change to favor their existence; for example, solid transitions to liquid with an increase in temperature.
Near absolute zero, a substance exists as a solid.
As heat is added to this substance it melts into a liquid at its melting point, boils into a gas at its boiling point, and if heated high enough would enter a plasma state in which the electrons are so energized that they leave their parent atoms.
Forms of matter that are not composed of molecules and are organized by different forces can also be considered different states of matter.
Superfluids (like Fermionic condensate) and the quark–gluon plasma are examples.
In a chemical equation, the state of matter of the chemicals may be shown as (s) for solid, (l) for liquid, and (g) for gas.
An aqueous solution is denoted (aq).
Matter in the plasma state is seldom used (if at all) in chemical equations, so there is no standard symbol to denote it.
In the rare equations that plasma is used in plasma is symbolized as (p).
Glass is a non-crystalline or amorphous solid material that exhibits a glass transition when heated towards the liquid state.
Glasses can be made of quite different classes of materials: inorganic networks (such as window glass, made of silicate plus additives), metallic alloys, ionic melts, aqueous solutions, molecular liquids, and polymers.
Thermodynamically, a glass is in a metastable state with respect to its crystalline counterpart.
The conversion rate, however, is practically zero.
A plastic crystal is a molecular solid with long-range positional order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom; in an orientational glass this degree of freedom is frozen in a quenched disordered state.
Similarly, in a spin glass magnetic disorder is frozen.
Liquid crystal states have properties intermediate between mobile liquids and ordered solids.
Generally, they are able to flow like a liquid, but exhibiting long-range order.
For example, the nematic phase consists of long rod-like molecules such as para-azoxyanisole, which is nematic in the temperature range 118–136 C .
In this state the molecules flow as in a liquid, but they all point in the same direction (within each domain) and cannot rotate freely.
Like a crystalline solid, but unlike a liquid, liquid crystals react to polarized light.
Other types of liquid crystals are described in the main article on these states.
Several types have technological importance, for example, in liquid crystal displays.
Transition metal atoms often have magnetic moments due to the net spin of electrons that remain unpaired and do not form chemical bonds.
In some solids the magnetic moments on different atoms are ordered and can form a ferromagnet, an antiferromagnet or a ferrimagnet.
In a ferromagnet—for instance, solid iron—the magnetic moment on each atom is aligned in the same direction (within a magnetic domain).
If the domains are also aligned, the solid is a permanent magnet, which is magnetic even in the absence of an external magnetic field.
The magnetization disappears when the magnet is heated to the Curie point, which for iron is 768 C .
An antiferromagnet has two networks of equal and opposite magnetic moments, which cancel each other out so that the net magnetization is zero.
For example, in nickel(II) oxide (NiO), half the nickel atoms have moments aligned in one direction and half in the opposite direction.
In a ferrimagnet, the two networks of magnetic moments are opposite but unequal, so that cancellation is incomplete and there is a non-zero net magnetization.
An example is magnetite (Fe O ), which contains Fe and Fe ions with different magnetic moments.
A quantum spin liquid (QSL) is a disordered state in a system of interacting quantum spins which preserves its disorder to very low temperatures, unlike other disordered states.
It is not a liquid in physical sense, but a solid whose magnetic order is inherently disordered.
The name "liquid" is due to an analogy with the molecular disorder in a conventional liquid.
A QSL is neither a ferromagnet, where magnetic domains are parallel, nor an antiferromagnet, where the magnetic domains are antiparallel; instead, the magnetic domains are randomly oriented.
This can be realized e.g. by geometrically frustrated magnetic moments that cannot point uniformly parallel or antiparallel.
When cooling down and settling to a state, the domain must "choose" an orientation, but if the possible states are similar in energy, one will be chosen randomly.
Consequently, despite strong short-range order, there is no long-range magnetic order.
Copolymers can undergo microphase separation to form a diverse array of periodic nanostructures, as shown in the example of the styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymer shown at right.
Microphase separation can be understood by analogy to the phase separation between oil and water.
Due to chemical incompatibility between the blocks, block copolymers undergo a similar phase separation.
However, because the blocks are covalently bonded to each other, they cannot demix macroscopically as water and oil can, and so instead the blocks form nanometer-sized structures.
Depending on the relative lengths of each block and the overall block topology of the polymer, many morphologies can be obtained, each its own phase of matter.
Ionic liquids also display microphase separation.
The anion and cation are not necessarily compatible and would demix otherwise, but electric charge attraction prevents them from separating.
Their anions and cations appear to diffuse within compartmentalized layers or micelles instead of freely as in a uniform liquid.
