[CLS] in the ri ##f , middle and high atlas mountains , there exist several different types of climates : mediterranean along the coastal lowlands , giving way to a humid temperate climate at higher elevations with sufficient moisture to allow for the growth of different species of oaks , moss carpets , juniper ##s , and atlantic fir which is a royal con ##ifer tree endemic to morocco . [SEP]
[CLS] at higher elevations , the climate becomes alpine in character , and can sustain ski resorts . [SEP]
[CLS] southeast of the atlas mountains , near the algerian borders , the climate becomes very dry , with long and hot summers . [SEP]
[CLS] extreme heat and low moisture levels are especially pronounced in the lowland regions east of the atlas range due to the rain shadow effect of the mountain system . [SEP]

[CLS] this is due to the diversity of climate and the precipitation patterns in the country . [SEP]
[CLS] most regions have distinct seasons where summer is usually not spoiled by rain and winter turns wet , snowy and humid with mild , cool to cold temperatures , while spring and fall see warm to mild weather characterised by flowers bloom ##ing in spring and falling leaves in autumn . [SEP]
