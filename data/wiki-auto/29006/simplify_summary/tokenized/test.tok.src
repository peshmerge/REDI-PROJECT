[CLS] a space telescope or space observatory is an instrument located in outer space to observe distant planets , galaxies and other astronomical objects . [SEP]
[CLS] space telescopes avoid the filtering of ultraviolet frequencies , x - rays and gamma rays ; the distortion ( sci ##nti ##llation ) of electromagnetic radiation ; as well as light pollution which are encountered by ground - based ob ##ser ##vat ##ories . [SEP]
[CLS] theo ##rized by lyman spit ##zer in 1946 , the first operational space telescopes were the american orbiting astronomical observatory o ##ao - 2 launched in 1968 and the soviet orion 1 ultraviolet telescope aboard space station sal ##yu ##t 1 in 1971 . [SEP]
[CLS] space telescopes are distinct from other imaging satellites pointed toward earth for purposes of espionage , weather analysis and other types of information gathering . [SEP]
[CLS] space ob ##ser ##vat ##ories are divided into two types : those which map the entire sky ( surveys ) , and those which focus on selected astronomical objects or parts of the sky and beyond . [SEP]
[CLS] wilhelm beer and johann heinrich mad ##ler in 1837 discussed the advantages of an observatory on the moon . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1946 , american theoretical astro ##phy ##sic ##ist lyman spit ##zer proposed a telescope in space , 11 years before the soviet union launched the first satellite , " sp ##ut ##nik 1 " . [SEP]
[CLS] spit ##zer ' s proposal called for a large telescope that would not be hind ##ered by earth ' s atmosphere . [SEP]
[CLS] after lobbying in the 1960s and 70s for such a system to be built , spit ##zer ' s vision ultimately materialized into the hub ##ble space telescope , which was launched on april 24 , 1990 by the space shuttle " discovery " ( sts - 31 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] performing astronomy from ground - based ob ##ser ##vat ##ories on earth is limited by the filtering and distortion of electromagnetic radiation ( sci ##nti ##llation or twin ##kling ) due to the atmosphere . [SEP]
[CLS] some terrestrial telescopes can reduce atmospheric effects with adaptive optics . [SEP]
[CLS] a telescope orbiting earth outside the atmosphere is subject neither to twin ##kling nor to light pollution from artificial light sources on earth . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , the angular resolution of space telescopes is often much smaller than a ground - based telescope with a similar aperture . [SEP]
[CLS] space - based astronomy is even more important for frequency ranges which are outside the optical window and the radio window , the only two wavelength ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum that are not severely at ##ten ##uated by the atmosphere . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , x - ray astronomy is nearly impossible when done from earth , and has reached its current importance in astronomy only due to orbiting x - ray telescopes such as the chandra observatory and the x ##mm - newton observatory . [SEP]
[CLS] infrared and ultraviolet are also largely blocked . [SEP]
[CLS] space telescopes are much more expensive to build than ground - based telescopes . [SEP]
[CLS] due to their location , space telescopes are also extremely difficult to maintain . [SEP]
[CLS] the hub ##ble space telescope was serviced by the space shuttle while many other space telescopes cannot be serviced at all . [SEP]
[CLS] satellites have been launched and operated by nasa , is ##ro , esa , japanese space agency and the soviet space program later succeeded by ro ##sko ##smo ##s of russia . [SEP]
[CLS] as of 2018 , many space ob ##ser ##vat ##ories have already completed their missions , while others continue operating on extended time . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the availability of space telescopes and ob ##ser ##vat ##ories in the future is threatened due to delays and budget cuts . [SEP]
[CLS] while future space ob ##ser ##vat ##ories are planned by nasa , jax ##a and the china national space administration , scientists fear that there would be gaps in coverage that would not be covered immediately by future projects and this would affect research in fundamental science . [SEP]
