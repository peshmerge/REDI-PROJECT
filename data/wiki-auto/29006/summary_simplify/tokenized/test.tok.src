[CLS] a space telescope or space observatory is an instrument located in outer space to observe distant planets , galaxies and other astronomical objects . [SEP]
[CLS] space telescopes avoid the filtering of ultraviolet frequencies , x - rays and gamma rays ; the distortion ( sci ##nti ##llation ) of electromagnetic radiation ; as well as light pollution which are encountered by ground - based ob ##ser ##vat ##ories . [SEP]
[CLS] theo ##rized by lyman spit ##zer in 1946 , the first operational space telescopes were the american orbiting astronomical observatory o ##ao - 2 launched in 1968 and the soviet orion 1 ultraviolet telescope aboard space station sal ##yu ##t 1 in 1971 . [SEP]
[CLS] space ob ##ser ##vat ##ories are divided into two types : those which map the entire sky ( surveys ) , and those which focus on selected astronomical objects or parts of the sky and beyond . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1946 , american theoretical astro ##phy ##sic ##ist lyman spit ##zer proposed a telescope in space , 11 years before the soviet union launched the first satellite , " sp ##ut ##nik 1 " . [SEP]
[CLS] a telescope orbiting earth outside the atmosphere is subject neither to twin ##kling nor to light pollution from artificial light sources on earth . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , the angular resolution of space telescopes is often much smaller than a ground - based telescope with a similar aperture . [SEP]
[CLS] space - based astronomy is even more important for frequency ranges which are outside the optical window and the radio window , the only two wavelength ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum that are not severely at ##ten ##uated by the atmosphere . [SEP]
[CLS] satellites have been launched and operated by nasa , is ##ro , esa , japanese space agency and the soviet space program later succeeded by ro ##sko ##smo ##s of russia . [SEP]
[CLS] as of 2018 , many space ob ##ser ##vat ##ories have already completed their missions , while others continue operating on extended time . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the availability of space telescopes and ob ##ser ##vat ##ories in the future is threatened due to delays and budget cuts . [SEP]
[CLS] while future space ob ##ser ##vat ##ories are planned by nasa , jax ##a and the china national space administration , scientists fear that there would be gaps in coverage that would not be covered immediately by future projects and this would affect research in fundamental science . [SEP]
