A space telescope or space observatory is an instrument located in outer space to observe distant planets, galaxies and other astronomical objects.
Space telescopes avoid the filtering of ultraviolet frequencies, X-rays and gamma rays; the distortion (scintillation) of electromagnetic radiation; as well as light pollution which are encountered by ground-based observatories.
Theorized by Lyman Spitzer in 1946, the first operational space telescopes were the American Orbiting Astronomical Observatory OAO-2 launched in 1968 and the Soviet Orion 1 ultraviolet telescope aboard space station Salyut 1 in 1971.
Space observatories are divided into two types: those which map the entire sky (surveys), and those which focus on selected astronomical objects or parts of the sky and beyond.
In 1946, American theoretical astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer proposed a telescope in space, 11 years before the Soviet Union launched the first satellite, "Sputnik 1".
A telescope orbiting Earth outside the atmosphere is subject neither to twinkling nor to light pollution from artificial light sources on Earth.
As a result, the angular resolution of space telescopes is often much smaller than a ground-based telescope with a similar aperture.
Space-based astronomy is even more important for frequency ranges which are outside the optical window and the radio window, the only two wavelength ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum that are not severely attenuated by the atmosphere.
Satellites have been launched and operated by NASA, ISRO, ESA, Japanese Space Agency and the Soviet space program later succeeded by Roskosmos of Russia.
As of 2018, many space observatories have already completed their missions, while others continue operating on extended time.
However, the availability of space telescopes and observatories in the future is threatened due to delays and budget cuts.
While future space observatories are planned by NASA, JAXA and the China National Space Administration, scientists fear that there would be gaps in coverage that would not be covered immediately by future projects and this would affect research in fundamental science.
