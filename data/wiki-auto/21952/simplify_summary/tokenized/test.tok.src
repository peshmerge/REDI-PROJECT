[CLS] naia ##d ( or ; ) , also known as neptune iii , is the inner ##most satellite of neptune , named after the naia ##ds of greek legend . [SEP]
[CLS] naia ##d was discovered sometime before mid - september 1989 from the images taken by the " voyager 2 " probe . [SEP]
[CLS] the last moon to be discovered during the fly ##by , it was designated s / 1989 n 6 . [SEP]
[CLS] the discovery was announced on 29 september 1989 , in the ia ##u circular no . 48 ##6 ##7 , and mentions " 25 frames taken over 11 days " , implying a discovery date of sometime before september 18 . [SEP]
[CLS] the name was given on 16 september 1991 . [SEP]
[CLS] naia ##d is irregular ##ly shaped and probably has not been modified by any internal geological processes since its formation . [SEP]
[CLS] it is likely that it is a rubble pile re - acc ##ret ##ed from fragments of neptune ' s original satellites , which were smashed up by per ##tur ##bation ##s from tri ##ton soon after that moon ' s capture into a very eccentric initial orbit . [SEP]
[CLS] since the " voyager 2 " fly ##by , the neptune system has been extensively studied from ground - based ob ##ser ##vat ##ories and the hub ##ble space telescope as well . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2002 â€“ 03 the ke ##ck telescope observed the system using adaptive optics and detected easily the largest four inner satellites . [SEP]
[CLS] tha ##lass ##a was found with some image processing , but naia ##d was not located . [SEP]
[CLS] hub ##ble has the ability to detect all the known satellites and possible new satellites even dim ##mer than those found by " voyager 2 " . [SEP]
[CLS] on october 8 , 2013 the set ##i institute announced that naia ##d had been located in archived hub ##ble imagery from 2004 . [SEP]
[CLS] the suspicion that the loss of positioning was due to considerable errors in naia ##d ' s ep ##hem ##eri ##s proved correct as naia ##d was ultimately located 80 degrees from its expected position . [SEP]
