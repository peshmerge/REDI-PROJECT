naiad shouldered or neptune iii is a moon of neptune , named after the naiads of greek legend .
naiad was found sometime before mid-september 1989 from the images taken by the " voyager 2 " probe .
the last moon to be discovered during the flyby , it was designated s / 1989 n 6 .
the discovery was announced on 29 september 1989 , in the iau circular no . 4867 , and mentions " 25 frames taken over 11 days " , implying a discovery date of sometime before september 18 .
the name was given on 16 september 1991 .
naiad is not a sphere and probably has not been modified by any internal geological processes since its formation .
it is likely that it is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of neptune 's original satellites , which were smashed up by perturbations from triton soon after that moon 's capture into a very eccentric orbit .
the " voyager 2 " flyby has been extensively studied from ground-based observatories and the hubble space telescope as well .
in 2002-03 , the keck telescope looked at the system using adaptive optics and detected easily the biggest four closer satellites .
thalassa was found with some image processing , but naiad was not located .
hubble has the ability to detect all the known moons and possible new satellites , even dimmer than those found by voyager 2 .
on october 8,2013 , the seti institute announced that naiad had been located in archived images from 2004 .
the suspicion that the loss of positioning was due to considerable errors in naiad 's ephemeris proved correct as naiad was ultimately located 80 degrees from its expected position .
