naiad shouldered or neptune iii is a moon of neptune , named after the naiads of greek legend .
the last moon to be discovered during the flyby , it was designated s / 1989 n 6 .
4867 , and mentions " 25 frames taken over 11 days " , implying a discovery date of sometime before september 18 .
naiad is not a sphere and probably has not been modified by any internal geological processes since its formation .
it is likely that it is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of neptune 's original satellites , which were smashed up by perturbations from triton soon after that moon 's capture into a very eccentric orbit .
the " voyager 2 " flyby has been extensively studied from ground-based observatories and the hubble space telescope as well .
on october 8,2013 , the seti institute announced that naiad had been located in archived images from 2004 .
the suspicion that the loss of positioning was due to considerable errors in naiad 's ephemeris proved correct as naiad was ultimately located 80 degrees from its expected position .
