[CLS] 48 ##6 ##7 , and mentions " 25 frames taken over 11 days " , implying a discovery date of sometime before september 18 . [SEP]
[CLS] naia ##d is irregular ##ly shaped and probably has not been modified by any internal geological processes since its formation . [SEP]
[CLS] it is likely that it is a rubble pile re - acc ##ret ##ed from fragments of neptune ' s original satellites , which were smashed up by per ##tur ##bation ##s from tri ##ton soon after that moon ' s capture into a very eccentric initial orbit . [SEP]
[CLS] since the " voyager 2 " fly ##by , the neptune system has been extensively studied from ground - based ob ##ser ##vat ##ories and the hub ##ble space telescope as well . [SEP]
[CLS] on october 8 , 2013 the set ##i institute announced that naia ##d had been located in archived hub ##ble imagery from 2004 . [SEP]
[CLS] the suspicion that the loss of positioning was due to considerable errors in naia ##d ' s ep ##hem ##eri ##s proved correct as naia ##d was ultimately located 80 degrees from its expected position . [SEP]
