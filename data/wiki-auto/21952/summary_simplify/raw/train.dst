Naiad ( or ; ), also known as Neptune III, is the innermost satellite of Neptune, named after the Naiads of Greek legend.
The last moon to be discovered during the flyby, it was designated S/1989 N 6.
4867, and mentions "25 frames taken over 11 days", implying a discovery date of sometime before September 18.
Naiad is irregularly shaped and probably has not been modified by any internal geological processes since its formation.
It is likely that it is a rubble pile re-accreted from fragments of Neptune's original satellites, which were smashed up by perturbations from Triton soon after that moon's capture into a very eccentric initial orbit.
Since the "Voyager 2" flyby, the Neptune system has been extensively studied from ground-based observatories and the Hubble Space Telescope as well.
On October 8, 2013 the SETI Institute announced that Naiad had been located in archived Hubble imagery from 2004.
The suspicion that the loss of positioning was due to considerable errors in Naiad's ephemeris proved correct as Naiad was ultimately located 80 degrees from its expected position.
