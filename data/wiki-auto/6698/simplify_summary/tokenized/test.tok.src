[CLS] camel case ( stylized as camel ##case ; also known as camel caps or more formally as medial capitals ) is the practice of writing phrases such that each word or abbreviation in the middle of the phrase begins with a capital letter , with no intervening spaces or pun ##ct ##uation . [SEP]
[CLS] common examples include " iphone " and " e ##bay " . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also sometimes used in online user ##name ##s such as " johns ##mith " , and to make multi - word domain names more leg ##ible , for example in advertisements . [SEP]
[CLS] camel case is often used for variable names in computer programming . [SEP]
[CLS] some programming styles prefer camel case with the first letter capital ##ised , others not . [SEP]
[CLS] for clarity , this article calls the two alternatives upper camel case ( initial upper ##case letter , also known as pascal case ) and lower camel case ( initial lower ##case letter , also known as dr ##ome ##dar ##y case ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some people and organizations , notably microsoft , use the term " camel case " only for lower camel case . [SEP]
[CLS] " pascal case " means only upper camel case . [SEP]
[CLS] camel case is distinct from title case , which capital ##ises all words but retains the spaces between them , and from tall man lettering , which uses capitals to emphasize the differences between similar - looking words such as " pre ##d ##nis ##one " and " pre ##d ##nis ##olo ##ne " . [SEP]
[CLS] camel case is also distinct from snake case , which uses under ##sco ##res interspersed with lower ##case letters ( sometimes with the first letter capital ##ized ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the combination of " upper camel case " and " snake case " is known as " darwin case " . [SEP]
[CLS] darwin case uses under ##sco ##res between words with initial upper ##case letters , as in " sample _ type " . [SEP]
[CLS] the original name of the practice , used in media studies , grammar ##s and the " oxford english dictionary " , was " medial capitals " . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest known occurrence of the term " inter ##cap ##s " on use ##net is in an april 1990 post to the group alt . folklore . computers by av ##i rap ##pop ##ort . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest use of the name " camel ##case " occurs in 1995 , in a post by newton love . [SEP]
[CLS] love has since said , " with the advent of programming languages having these sorts of construct ##s , the hum ##pine ##ss of the style made me call it hum ##py ##case at first , before i settled on camel ##case . [SEP]
[CLS] i had been calling it camel ##case for years . [SEP]
[CLS] . . . the citation above was just the first time i had used the name on use ##net . " [SEP]
[CLS] the use of medial capitals as a convention in the regular spelling of everyday texts is rare , but is used in some languages as a solution to particular problems which arise when two words or segments are combined . [SEP]
[CLS] in italian , pronouns can be suffix ##ed to verbs , and because the honor ##ific form of second - person pronouns is capital ##ized , this can produce a sentence like " non ho tr ##ova ##to il tempo di ri ##sp ##ond ##er ##le " ( " i have not found time to answer you " – where " le " means " to you " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in german , the medial capital letter i , called " bin ##nen - i " , is sometimes used in a word like " student ##inn ##en " ( " students " ) to indicate that both " student ##en " ( " male students " ) and " student ##inn ##en " ( " female students " ) are intended simultaneously . [SEP]
[CLS] however , mid - word capital ##isation does not conform to german or ##th ##ography ; the previous example could be correctly written using parentheses as " student ( inn ) en " , analogous to " congress ( wo ) man " in english . [SEP]
[CLS] in irish , camel ##case is used when an in ##fle ##ction ##al prefix is attached to a proper noun , for example ( " in galway " ) , from ( " galway " ) ; ( " the scottish person " ) , from ( " scottish person " ) ; and ( " to ireland " ) , from ( " ireland " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in recent scots gaelic or ##th ##ography , a h ##yp ##hen has been inserted : . [SEP]
[CLS] this convention is also used by several written ban ##tu languages ( e . g . , " ki ##sw ##ah ##ili " , " sw ##ah ##ili language " ; " is ##iz ##ulu " , " zulu language " ) and several indigenous languages of mexico ( e . g . nah ##ua ##tl , to ##ton ##aca ##n , mix ##e – z ##o ##que , and some ot ##o - man ##gue ##an languages ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in dutch , when capital ##izing the dig ##raph " i ##j " , both the letter " i " and the letter " j " are capital ##ized , for example in the country ##name " i ##js ##land " . [SEP]
[CLS] in english , medial capitals are usually only found in scottish or irish " mac - " or " mc - " names , where for example " macdonald , mcdonald , " and " macdonald " are common spelling variants of the same name , and in anglo - norman " fitz - " names , where for example both " fitzgerald " and " fitzgerald " are found . [SEP]
[CLS] in their english style guide " the king ' s english " , first published in 1906 , h . w . and f . g . fowler suggested that medial capitals could be used in triple compound words where h ##yp ##hen ##s would cause ambiguity — the examples they give are " king ##mark - like " ( as against " king mark - like " ) and " anglo - south ##ame ##rica ##n " ( as against " anglo - south american " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , they described the system as " too hopeless ##ly contrary to use at present . " [SEP]
[CLS] in the scholarly translit ##eration of languages written in other scripts , medial capitals are used in similar situations . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in translit ##erated hebrew , " ha ' iv ##ri " means " the hebrew person " or " the jew " and " b ' yer ##ush ##ala ##yi ##m " means " in jerusalem " . [SEP]
[CLS] in tibetan proper names like " r ##lo ##bs ##ang " , the " r " stands for a prefix g ##ly ##ph in the original script that functions as tone marker rather than a normal letter . [SEP]
[CLS] another example is " ts ##iu ##rk ##u " , a latin transcription of the che ##chen term for the cap ##ping stone of the characteristic medieval defensive towers of che ##chen ##ia and ing ##ush ##eti ##a ; the capital letter " i " here den ##oting a phone ##me distinct from the one transcribed as " i " . [SEP]
[CLS] medial capitals are traditionally used in abbreviation ##s to reflect the capital ##ization that the words would have when written out in full , for example in the academic titles phd or bsc . [SEP]
[CLS] in german , the names of statutes are abbreviated using embedded capitals , e . g . st ##gb ( st ##raf ##ges ##etz ##buch ) for criminal code , pat ##g ( patent ##ges ##etz ) for patent act , b ##ver ##f ##g ( bun ##des ##ver ##fa ##ss ##ung ##sg ##eric ##ht ) for federal constitutional court , or the very common gmbh ( gesellschaft mit be ##sch ##rank ##ter ha ##ft ##ung ) for company with limited liability . [SEP]
[CLS] in this context , there can even be three or more " camel ##case " capitals , e . g . in t ##z ##bf ##g for te ##il ##ze ##it - und be ##fr ##ist ##ung ##sg ##ese ##tz ( act on part - time and limited term occupations ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in french , camel case acronym ##s such as ou ##lip ##o ( 1960 ) were favored for a time as alternatives to initial ##isms . [SEP]
[CLS] camel case is often used to translit ##erate initial ##isms into alphabet ##s where two letters may be required to represent a single character of the original alphabet , e . g . , ds ##h ##k from cyrillic д ##ш ##к . [SEP]
[CLS] the first systematic and widespread use of medial capitals for technical purposes was the notation for chemical formula ##e invented by the swedish chemist jacob be ##rz ##eli ##us in 1813 . [SEP]
[CLS] to replace the multitude of naming and symbol conventions used by chemist ##s until that time , he proposed to indicate each chemical element by a symbol of one or two letters , the first one being capital ##ized . [SEP]
[CLS] the capital ##ization allowed formula ##e like " na ##cl " to be written without spaces and still be par ##sed without ambiguity . [SEP]
[CLS] be ##rz ##eli ##us ' system continues to be used , augmented with three - letter symbols such as " u ##ue " for un ##con ##firmed or unknown elements and abbreviation ##s for some common sub ##sti ##tu ##ents ( especially in the field of organic chemistry , for instance " et " for " et ##hyl - " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this has been further extended to describe the amino acid sequences of proteins and other similar domains . [SEP]
[CLS] since the early 20th century , medial capitals have occasionally been used for corporate names and product trademark ##s , such as [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1970s and 1980s , medial capitals were adopted as a standard or alternative naming convention for multi - word id ##ent ##ifiers in several programming languages . [SEP]
[CLS] the precise origin of the convention in computer programming has not yet been settled . [SEP]
[CLS] a 1954 conference proceedings occasionally informally referred to ibm ' s speed ##co ##ding system as " speed ##co " . [SEP]
[CLS] christopher st ##rac ##hey ' s paper on gp ##m ( 1965 ) , shows a program that includes some medial capital id ##ent ##ifiers , including " cod ##ice _ 1 " and " cod ##ice _ 2 " . [SEP]
[CLS] multiple - word descriptive id ##ent ##ifiers with embedded spaces such as cod ##ice _ 3 or cod ##ice _ 4 cannot be used in most programming languages because the spaces between the words would be par ##sed as del ##imi ##ters between token ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the alternative of running the words together as in cod ##ice _ 5 or cod ##ice _ 6 is difficult to understand and possibly misleading ; for example , cod ##ice _ 6 is an english word ( able to be charted ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some early programming languages , notably li ##sp ( 1958 ) and co ##bol ( 1959 ) , addressed this problem by allowing a h ##yp ##hen ( " - " ) to be used between words of compound id ##ent ##ifiers , as in " end - of - file " : li ##sp because it worked well with prefix notation ( a li ##sp par ##ser would not treat a h ##yp ##hen in the middle of a symbol as a sub ##tra ##ction operator ) and co ##bol because its operators were individual english words . [SEP]
[CLS] this convention remains in use in these languages , and is also common in program names entered on a command line , as in unix . [SEP]
[CLS] however , this solution was not adequate for mathematical ##ly - oriented languages such as fort ##ran ( 1955 ) and al ##gol ( 1958 ) , which used the h ##yp ##hen as an in ##fi ##x sub ##tra ##ction operator . [SEP]
[CLS] fort ##ran ignored blank ##s altogether , so programmers could use embedded spaces in variable names . [SEP]
[CLS] however , this feature was not very useful since the early versions of the language restricted id ##ent ##ifiers to no more than six characters . [SEP]
[CLS] ex ##ace ##rba ##ting the problem , common punched card character sets of the time were upper ##case only and lacked other special characters . [SEP]
[CLS] it was only in the late 1960s that the widespread adoption of the as ##ci ##i character set made both lower ##case and the under ##sco ##re character cod ##ice _ 8 universally available . [SEP]
[CLS] some languages , notably c , promptly adopted under ##sco ##res as word sep ##arat ##ors , and id ##ent ##ifiers such as cod ##ice _ 9 are still prevalent in c programs and libraries ( as well as in later languages influenced by c , such as per ##l and python ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , some languages and programmers chose to avoid under ##sco ##res — among other reasons to prevent confusing them with whites ##pace — and adopted camel case instead . [SEP]
[CLS] charles simon ##yi , who worked at x ##ero ##x parc in the 1970s and later oversaw the creation of microsoft ' s office suite of applications , invented and taught the use of hungarian notation , one version of which uses the lower ##case letter ( s ) at the start of a ( capital ##ized ) variable name to denote its type . [SEP]
[CLS] one account claims that the camel case style first became popular at x ##ero ##x parc around 1978 , with the mesa programming language developed for the x ##ero ##x alto computer . [SEP]
[CLS] this machine lacked an under ##sco ##re key ( whose place was taken by a left arrow " ← " ) , and the h ##yp ##hen and space characters were not permitted in id ##ent ##ifiers , leaving camel case as the only viable scheme for read ##able multi ##word names . [SEP]
[CLS] the parc mesa language manual ( 1979 ) included a coding standard with specific rules for upper and lower camel case that was strictly followed by the mesa libraries and the alto operating system . [SEP]
[CLS] nik ##laus wi ##rth , the inventor of pascal , came to appreciate camel case during a sa ##bba ##tical at parc and used it in mod ##ula , his next programming language . [SEP]
[CLS] the small ##talk language , which was developed originally on the alto , also uses camel case instead of under ##sco ##res . [SEP]
[CLS] this language became quite popular in the early 1980s , and thus may also have been instrumental in spreading the style outside parc . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1980s and 1990s , after the advent of the personal computer exposed hacker culture to the world , camel case then became fashionable for corporate trade names in non - computer fields as well . [SEP]
[CLS] during the dot - com bubble of the late 1990s , the lower ##case prefix ##es " e " ( for " electronic " ) and " i " ( for " internet " , " information " , " intelligent " , etc . ) became quite common , giving rise to names like apple ' s im ##ac and the e ##box software platform . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1998 , dave yo ##st suggested that chemist ##s use medial capitals to aid read ##ability of long chemical names , e . g . write amid ##op ##hos ##ph ##ori ##bos ##yl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se instead of amid ##op ##hos ##ph ##ori ##bos ##yl ##tra ##ns ##fera ##se . [SEP]
[CLS] this usage was not widely adopted . [SEP]
[CLS] camel ##case is sometimes used for abbreviated names of certain neighborhoods , e . g . new york city neighborhoods " soho " ( " so " ut ##h of " ho " us ##ton street ) and " tribe ##ca " ( " tri " angle " be " low " ca " na ##l street ) and san francisco ' s " so ##ma " ( " so " ut ##h of " ma " r ##ke ##t ) . [SEP]
[CLS] such usage ##s er ##ode quickly , so the neighborhoods are now typically rendered as " soho " , " tribe ##ca " , and " so ##ma " . [SEP]
[CLS] internal capital ##ization has also been used for other technical codes like he ##la ( 1983 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of medial caps for compound id ##ent ##ifiers is recommended by the coding style guidelines of many organizations or software projects . [SEP]
[CLS] for some languages ( such as mesa , pascal , mod ##ula , java and microsoft ' s . n [SEP]
[CLS] net ) this practice is recommended by the language developers or by authoritative manual ##s and has therefore become part of the language ' s " culture " . [SEP]
[CLS] style guidelines often distinguish between upper and lower camel case , typically specify ##ing which variety should be used for specific kinds of entities : variables , record fields , methods , procedures , types , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] these rules are sometimes supported by static analysis tools that check source code for adherence . [SEP]
[CLS] the original hungarian notation for programming , for example , specifies that a lower ##case abbreviation for the " usage type " ( not data type ) should prefix all variable names , with the remainder of the name in upper camel case ; as such it is a form of lower camel case . [SEP]
[CLS] programming id ##ent ##ifiers often need to contain acronym ##s and initial ##isms that are already in upper ##case , such as " old html file " . [SEP]
[CLS] by analogy with the title case rules , the natural camel case rendering would have the abbreviation all in upper ##case , namely " old ##ht ##ml ##fi ##le " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , this approach is problematic when two acronym ##s occur together ( e . g . , " par ##se db ##m xml " would become " par ##sed ##bm ##x ##ml " ) or when the standard mandates lower camel case but the name begins with an abbreviation ( e . g . " sql server " would become " sql ##ser ##ver " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , some programmers prefer to treat abbreviation ##s as if they were lower ##case words and write " old ##ht ##ml ##fi ##le " , " par ##sed ##bm ##x ##ml " or " sql ##ser ##ver " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , this can make it harder to recognise that a given word is intended as an acronym . [SEP]
[CLS] camel case is used in some wi ##ki mark ##up languages for terms that should be automatically linked to other wi ##ki pages . [SEP]
[CLS] this convention was originally used in ward cunningham ' s original wi ##ki software , wi ##ki ##wi ##ki ##we ##b , and can be activated in most other wi ##kis . [SEP]
[CLS] some wi ##ki engines such as ti ##dd ##ly ##wi ##ki , tr ##ac and pm ##wi ##ki make use of it in the default settings , but usually also provide a configuration mechanism or plug ##in to di ##sable it . [SEP]
[CLS] wikipedia formerly used camel case linking as well , but switched to explicit link mark ##up using square brackets and many other wi ##ki sites have done the same . [SEP]
[CLS] some wi ##kis that do not use camel case linking may still use the camel case as a naming convention , such as about ##us . [SEP]
[CLS] the ni ##em registry requires that xml data elements use upper camel case and xml attributes use lower camel case . [SEP]
[CLS] most popular command - line interfaces and script ##ing languages cannot easily handle file names that contain embedded spaces ( usually requiring the name to be put in quotes ) . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , users of those systems often resort to camel case ( or under ##sco ##res , h ##yp ##hen ##s and other " safe " characters ) for compound file names like my ##jo ##bre ##sume . pdf . [SEP]
[CLS] micro ##bl ##og ##ging and social networking sites that limit the number of characters in a message are potential outlets for medial capitals . [SEP]
[CLS] using camel case between words reduces the number of spaces , and thus the number of characters , in a given message , allowing more content to fit into the limited space . [SEP]
[CLS] hash ##tag ##s , especially long ones , often use camel case to maintain read ##ability ( e . g . # colleges ##tu ##dent ##pro ##ble ##ms is easier to read than # colleges ##tu ##dent ##pro ##ble ##ms ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in website ur ##ls , spaces are percent - encoded as " % 20 " , making the address longer and less human read ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] by om ##itt ##ing spaces , camel case does not have this problem . [SEP]
[CLS] camel case has been criticised as negatively impact ##ing read ##ability due to the removal of spaces and upper ##cas ##ing of every word . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2009 study comparing snake case to camel case found that camel case id ##ent ##ifiers could be recognised with higher accuracy among both programmers and non - programmers , and that programmers already trained in camel case were able to recognise those id ##ent ##ifiers faster than under ##sco ##red snake - case id ##ent ##ifiers . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2010 follow - up study , under the same conditions but using an improved measurement method with use of eye - tracking equipment , indicates : " while results indicate no difference in accuracy between the two styles , subjects recognize id ##ent ##ifiers in the under ##sco ##re style more quickly . " [SEP]
