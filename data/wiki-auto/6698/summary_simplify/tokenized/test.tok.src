[CLS] camel case ( stylized as camel ##case ; also known as camel caps or more formally as medial capitals ) is the practice of writing phrases such that each word or abbreviation in the middle of the phrase begins with a capital letter , with no intervening spaces or pun ##ct ##uation . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also sometimes used in online user ##name ##s such as " johns ##mith " , and to make multi - word domain names more leg ##ible , for example in advertisements . [SEP]
[CLS] camel case is often used for variable names in computer programming . [SEP]
[CLS] some people and organizations , notably microsoft , use the term " camel case " only for lower camel case . [SEP]
[CLS] camel case is distinct from title case , which capital ##ises all words but retains the spaces between them , and from tall man lettering , which uses capitals to emphasize the differences between similar - looking words such as " pre ##d ##nis ##one " and " pre ##d ##nis ##olo ##ne " . [SEP]
[CLS] the original name of the practice , used in media studies , grammar ##s and the " oxford english dictionary " , was " medial capitals " . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest known occurrence of the term " inter ##cap ##s " on use ##net is in an april 1990 post to the group alt . folklore . computers by av ##i rap ##pop ##ort . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest use of the name " camel ##case " occurs in 1995 , in a post by newton love . [SEP]
[CLS] love has since said , " with the advent of programming languages having these sorts of construct ##s , the hum ##pine ##ss of the style made me call it hum ##py ##case at first , before i settled on camel ##case . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of medial capitals as a convention in the regular spelling of everyday texts is rare , but is used in some languages as a solution to particular problems which arise when two words or segments are combined . [SEP]
[CLS] in italian , pronouns can be suffix ##ed to verbs , and because the honor ##ific form of second - person pronouns is capital ##ized , this can produce a sentence like " non ho tr ##ova ##to il tempo di ri ##sp ##ond ##er ##le " ( " i have not found time to answer you " – where " le " means " to you " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , mid - word capital ##isation does not conform to german or ##th ##ography ; the previous example could be correctly written using parentheses as " student ( inn ) en " , analogous to " congress ( wo ) man " in english . [SEP]
[CLS] in their english style guide " the king ' s english " , first published in 1906 , h . w . and f . g . fowler suggested that medial capitals could be used in triple compound words where h ##yp ##hen ##s would cause ambiguity — the examples they give are " king ##mark - like " ( as against " king mark - like " ) and " anglo - south ##ame ##rica ##n " ( as against " anglo - south american " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] another example is " ts ##iu ##rk ##u " , a latin transcription of the che ##chen term for the cap ##ping stone of the characteristic medieval defensive towers of che ##chen ##ia and ing ##ush ##eti ##a ; the capital letter " i " here den ##oting a phone ##me distinct from the one transcribed as " i " . [SEP]
[CLS] medial capitals are traditionally used in abbreviation ##s to reflect the capital ##ization that the words would have when written out in full , for example in the academic titles phd or bsc . [SEP]
[CLS] in this context , there can even be three or more " camel ##case " capitals , e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] in french , camel case acronym ##s such as ou ##lip ##o ( 1960 ) were favored for a time as alternatives to initial ##isms . [SEP]
[CLS] camel case is often used to translit ##erate initial ##isms into alphabet ##s where two letters may be required to represent a single character of the original alphabet , e . g . , ds ##h ##k from cyrillic д ##ш ##к . [SEP]
[CLS] the first systematic and widespread use of medial capitals for technical purposes was the notation for chemical formula ##e invented by the swedish chemist jacob be ##rz ##eli ##us in 1813 . [SEP]
[CLS] to replace the multitude of naming and symbol conventions used by chemist ##s until that time , he proposed to indicate each chemical element by a symbol of one or two letters , the first one being capital ##ized . [SEP]
[CLS] be ##rz ##eli ##us ' system continues to be used , augmented with three - letter symbols such as " u ##ue " for un ##con ##firmed or unknown elements and abbreviation ##s for some common sub ##sti ##tu ##ents ( especially in the field of organic chemistry , for instance " et " for " et ##hyl - " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this has been further extended to describe the amino acid sequences of proteins and other similar domains . [SEP]
[CLS] since the early 20th century , medial capitals have occasionally been used for corporate names and product trademark ##s , such as [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1970s and 1980s , medial capitals were adopted as a standard or alternative naming convention for multi - word id ##ent ##ifiers in several programming languages . [SEP]
[CLS] the precise origin of the convention in computer programming has not yet been settled . [SEP]
[CLS] multiple - word descriptive id ##ent ##ifiers with embedded spaces such as cod ##ice _ 3 or cod ##ice _ 4 cannot be used in most programming languages because the spaces between the words would be par ##sed as del ##imi ##ters between token ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the alternative of running the words together as in cod ##ice _ 5 or cod ##ice _ 6 is difficult to understand and possibly misleading ; for example , cod ##ice _ 6 is an english word ( able to be charted ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some early programming languages , notably li ##sp ( 1958 ) and co ##bol ( 1959 ) , addressed this problem by allowing a h ##yp ##hen ( " - " ) to be used between words of compound id ##ent ##ifiers , as in " end - of - file " : li ##sp because it worked well with prefix notation ( a li ##sp par ##ser would not treat a h ##yp ##hen in the middle of a symbol as a sub ##tra ##ction operator ) and co ##bol because its operators were individual english words . [SEP]
[CLS] however , this feature was not very useful since the early versions of the language restricted id ##ent ##ifiers to no more than six characters . [SEP]
[CLS] it was only in the late 1960s that the widespread adoption of the as ##ci ##i character set made both lower ##case and the under ##sco ##re character cod ##ice _ 8 universally available . [SEP]
[CLS] some languages , notably c , promptly adopted under ##sco ##res as word sep ##arat ##ors , and id ##ent ##ifiers such as cod ##ice _ 9 are still prevalent in c programs and libraries ( as well as in later languages influenced by c , such as per ##l and python ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , some languages and programmers chose to avoid under ##sco ##res — among other reasons to prevent confusing them with whites ##pace — and adopted camel case instead . [SEP]
[CLS] charles simon ##yi , who worked at x ##ero ##x parc in the 1970s and later oversaw the creation of microsoft ' s office suite of applications , invented and taught the use of hungarian notation , one version of which uses the lower ##case letter ( s ) at the start of a ( capital ##ized ) variable name to denote its type . [SEP]
[CLS] one account claims that the camel case style first became popular at x ##ero ##x parc around 1978 , with the mesa programming language developed for the x ##ero ##x alto computer . [SEP]
[CLS] this machine lacked an under ##sco ##re key ( whose place was taken by a left arrow " ← " ) , and the h ##yp ##hen and space characters were not permitted in id ##ent ##ifiers , leaving camel case as the only viable scheme for read ##able multi ##word names . [SEP]
[CLS] the parc mesa language manual ( 1979 ) included a coding standard with specific rules for upper and lower camel case that was strictly followed by the mesa libraries and the alto operating system . [SEP]
[CLS] nik ##laus wi ##rth , the inventor of pascal , came to appreciate camel case during a sa ##bba ##tical at parc and used it in mod ##ula , his next programming language . [SEP]
[CLS] this language became quite popular in the early 1980s , and thus may also have been instrumental in spreading the style outside parc . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1980s and 1990s , after the advent of the personal computer exposed hacker culture to the world , camel case then became fashionable for corporate trade names in non - computer fields as well . [SEP]
[CLS] became quite common , giving rise to names like apple ' s im ##ac and the e ##box software platform . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of medial caps for compound id ##ent ##ifiers is recommended by the coding style guidelines of many organizations or software projects . [SEP]
[CLS] for some languages ( such as mesa , pascal , mod ##ula , java and microsoft ' s . n [SEP]
[CLS] net ) this practice is recommended by the language developers or by authoritative manual ##s and has therefore become part of the language ' s " culture " . [SEP]
[CLS] style guidelines often distinguish between upper and lower camel case , typically specify ##ing which variety should be used for specific kinds of entities : variables , record fields , methods , procedures , types , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] the original hungarian notation for programming , for example , specifies that a lower ##case abbreviation for the " usage type " ( not data type ) should prefix all variable names , with the remainder of the name in upper camel case ; as such it is a form of lower camel case . [SEP]
[CLS] programming id ##ent ##ifiers often need to contain acronym ##s and initial ##isms that are already in upper ##case , such as " old html file " . [SEP]
[CLS] by analogy with the title case rules , the natural camel case rendering would have the abbreviation all in upper ##case , namely " old ##ht ##ml ##fi ##le " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , this approach is problematic when two acronym ##s occur together ( e . g . , " par ##se db ##m xml " would become " par ##sed ##bm ##x ##ml " ) or when the standard mandates lower camel case but the name begins with an abbreviation ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] wikipedia formerly used camel case linking as well , but switched to explicit link mark ##up using square brackets and many other wi ##ki sites have done the same . [SEP]
[CLS] most popular command - line interfaces and script ##ing languages cannot easily handle file names that contain embedded spaces ( usually requiring the name to be put in quotes ) . [SEP]
[CLS] micro ##bl ##og ##ging and social networking sites that limit the number of characters in a message are potential outlets for medial capitals . [SEP]
[CLS] using camel case between words reduces the number of spaces , and thus the number of characters , in a given message , allowing more content to fit into the limited space . [SEP]
[CLS] in website ur ##ls , spaces are percent - encoded as " % 20 " , making the address longer and less human read ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] camel case has been criticised as negatively impact ##ing read ##ability due to the removal of spaces and upper ##cas ##ing of every word . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2009 study comparing snake case to camel case found that camel case id ##ent ##ifiers could be recognised with higher accuracy among both programmers and non - programmers , and that programmers already trained in camel case were able to recognise those id ##ent ##ifiers faster than under ##sco ##red snake - case id ##ent ##ifiers . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2010 follow - up study , under the same conditions but using an improved measurement method with use of eye - tracking equipment , indicates : " while results indicate no difference in accuracy between the two styles , subjects recognize id ##ent ##ifiers in the under ##sco ##re style more quickly . " [SEP]
