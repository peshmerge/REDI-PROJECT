[CLS] the kingdom of israel and the kingdom of judah were related kingdoms from the iron age period of the ancient levant . [SEP]
[CLS] the kingdom of israel emerged as an important local power by the 10th century bce before falling to the neo - assyrian empire in 72 ##2 bce . [SEP]
[CLS] israel ' s southern neighbor , the kingdom of judah , emerged in the 8th or 9th century bce and later became a client state of first the neo - assyrian empire and then the neo - babylonian empire before a revolt against the latter led to its destruction in 58 ##6 bce . [SEP]
[CLS] following the fall of babylon to the ac ##hae ##men ##id empire under cyrus the great in 53 ##9 bce , some jude ##an exiles returned to jerusalem , ina ##ug ##ura ##ting the format ##ive period in the development of a distinctive judah ##ite identity in the province of ye ##hu ##d medina ##ta . [SEP]
[CLS] during the hellenistic classic period , ye ##hu ##d was absorbed into the subsequent hellenistic kingdoms that followed the conquest ##s of alexander the great , but in the 2nd century bce the ju ##dae ##ans revolt ##ed against the se ##le ##uc ##id empire and created the has ##mon ##ean kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] following the installation of client kingdoms under the hero ##dian dynasty , the province of jude ##a was wr ##ack ##ed by civil disturbances , which culminated in the first jewish – roman war , the destruction of the second temple , the emergence of rabbi ##nic judaism and early christianity . [SEP]
[CLS] the eastern mediterranean sea ##board the levant stretches 400 miles north to south from the tau ##rus mountains to the sinai peninsula , and 70 to 100 miles east to west between the sea and the arabian desert . [SEP]
[CLS] to the east again lie the steep - sided valley occupied by the jordan river , the dead sea , and the wadi of the arab ##ah , which continues down to the eastern arm of the red sea . [SEP]
[CLS] beyond the plateau is the syrian desert , separating the levant from mesopotamia . [SEP]
[CLS] the location and geographical characteristics of the narrow levant made the area a battle ##ground among the powerful entities that surrounded it . [SEP]
[CLS] can ##aan in the late bronze age was a shadow of what it had been centuries earlier : many cities were abandoned , others sh ##rank in size , and the total settled population was probably not much more than a hundred thousand . [SEP]
[CLS] settlement was concentrated in cities along the coastal plain and along major communication routes ; the central and northern hill country which would later become the biblical kingdom of israel was only sparsely inhabited although letters from the egyptian archives indicate that jerusalem was already a can ##aan ##ite city - state rec ##og ##nis ##ing egyptian over ##lord ##ship . [SEP]
[CLS] politically and culturally it was dominated by egypt , each city under its own ruler , constantly at odds with its neighbours , and appealing to the egyptians to ad ##ju ##dicate their differences . [SEP]
[CLS] the can ##aan ##ite city state system broke down during the late bronze age collapse , and can ##aan ##ite culture was then gradually absorbed into that of the phil ##ist ##ines , ph ##oe ##nic ##ians and israeli ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] this " israel " was a cultural and probably political entity , well enough established for the egyptians to perceive it as a possible challenge , but an ethnic group rather than an organised state ; archaeologist paula mc ##nut ##t says : " it is probably . . . during iron age i that a population began to identify itself as ' israeli ##te ' , " different ##iating itself from its neighbours via prohibition ##s on inter ##mar ##ria ##ge , an emphasis on family history and genealogy , and religion . [SEP]
[CLS] archaeologists and historians attempting to trace the origins of these villagers have found it impossible to identify any distinctive features that could define them as specifically israeli ##te collar ##ed - rim jars and four - room houses have been identified outside the highlands and thus cannot be used to distinguish israeli ##te sites , and while the pottery of the highland villages is far more limited than that of lowland can ##aan ##ite sites , it develops ty ##pol ##ogical ##ly out of can ##aan ##ite pottery that came before . [SEP]
[CLS] israel fin ##kel ##stein proposed that the oval or circular layout that distinguishes some of the earliest highland sites , and the notable absence of pig bones from hill sites , could be taken as markers of ethnicity , but others have caution ##ed that these can be a " common - sense " adaptation to highland life and not necessarily rev ##ela ##tory of origins . [SEP]
[CLS] they described how , up until 1967 , the israeli ##te heartland in the highlands of western palestine was virtually an archaeological " terra inc ##og ##ni ##ta " . [SEP]
[CLS] these surveys have revealed the sudden emergence of a new culture contrasting with the phil ##ist ##ine and can ##aan ##ite societies existing in the land of israel earlier during iron age i . [SEP]
[CLS] this new culture is characterised by a lack of pork remains ( whereas pork formed 20 % of the phil ##ist ##ine diet in places ) , by an abandonment of the phil ##ist ##ine / can ##aan ##ite custom of having highly decorated pottery , and by the practice of ci ##rc ##um ##cision . [SEP]
[CLS] in the central highlands this resulted in unification in a kingdom with the city of sam ##aria as its capital , possibly by the second half of the 10th century bce when an inscription of the egyptian pharaoh sho ##sh ##en ##q i , the biblical shi ##sha ##k , records a series of campaigns directed at the area . [SEP]
[CLS] israel had clearly emerged by the middle of the 9th century bce , when the assyrian king sha ##lman ##ese ##r iii names " ah ##ab the israeli ##te " among his enemies at the battle of q ##ar ##qa ##r ( 85 ##3 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] at this time israel was apparently engaged in a three - way contest with damascus and tyre for control of the je ##z ##ree ##l valley and galilee in the north , and with mo ##ab , am ##mon and ara ##m damascus in the east for control of gil ##ead ; the mesh ##a ste ##le ( c . 83 ##0 ) , left by a king of mo ##ab , celebrates his success in throwing off the oppression of the " house of om ##ri " ( i . e . , israel ) . [SEP]
[CLS] both the biblical and assyrian sources speak of a massive deportation of people from israel and their replacement with settlers from other parts of the empire such population exchanges were an established part of assyrian imperial policy , a means of breaking the old power structure and the former israel never again became an independent political entity . [SEP]
[CLS] there are indications that during the 10th and 9th centuries bce , the southern highlands had been divided between a number of centres , none with clear prima ##cy . [SEP]
[CLS] during the reign of he ##zek ##iah , between c . 71 ##5 and 68 ##6 bce , a notable increase in the power of the jude ##an state can be observed . [SEP]
[CLS] this is reflected in archaeological sites and findings , such as the broad wall ; a defensive city wall in jerusalem ; and the si ##lo ##am tunnel , an aqueduct designed to provide jerusalem with water during an impending siege by the neo - assyrian empire led by sen ##nac ##her ##ib ; and the si ##lo ##am inscription , a lin ##tel inscription found over the doorway of a tomb , has been ascribed to com ##pt ##roller she ##bn ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] l ##ml ##k seals on storage jar handles , excavated from strata in and around that formed by sen ##nac ##her ##ib ' s destruction , appear to have been used throughout sen ##nac ##her ##ib ' s 29 - year reign , along with bull ##ae from sealed documents , some that belonged to he ##zek ##iah himself and others that name his servants . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 7th century jerusalem grew to contain a population many times greater than earlier and achieved clear dominance over its neighbours . [SEP]
[CLS] this occurred at the same time that israel was being destroyed by the neo - assyrian empire , and was probably the result of a cooperative arrangement with the assyrian ##s to establish judah as an assyrian vassal state controlling the valuable olive industry . [SEP]
[CLS] judah pro ##sper ##ed as a vassal state ( despite a disastrous rebellion against sen ##nac ##her ##ib ) , but in the last half of the 7th century bce , ass ##yria suddenly collapsed , and the ensuing competition between egypt and the neo - babylonian empire for control of the land led to the destruction of judah in a series of campaigns between 59 ##7 and 58 ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] babylonian judah suffered a steep decline in both economy and population and lost the ne ##ge ##v , the she ##ph ##ela ##h , and part of the jude ##an hill country , including he ##bron , to en ##cr ##oa ##chment ##s from edo ##m and other neighbours . [SEP]
[CLS] jerusalem , while probably not totally abandoned , was much smaller than previously , and the town of mi ##z ##pa ##h in benjamin in the relatively un ##sca ##thed northern section of the kingdom became the capital of the new babylonian province of ye ##hu ##d medina ##ta . [SEP]
[CLS] ( this was standard babylonian practice : when the phil ##ist ##ine city of ash ##kal ##on was conquered in 60 ##4 , the political , religious and economic elite but not the bulk of the population was banished and the administrative centre shifted to a new location ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there is also a strong probability that for most or all of the period the temple at bethel in benjamin replaced that at jerusalem , boost ##ing the prestige of bethel ' s priests ( the aaron ##ites ) against those of jerusalem ( the za ##do ##kit ##es ) , now in exile in babylon . [SEP]
[CLS] the most significant casualty was the state ideology of " zion theology , " the idea that the god of israel had chosen jerusalem for his dwelling - place and that the david ##ic dynasty would reign there forever . [SEP]
[CLS] the fall of the city and the end of david ##ic kings ##hip forced the leaders of the exile community kings , priests , scribe ##s and prophets to reform ##ulate the concepts of community , faith and politics . [SEP]
[CLS] the exile community in babylon thus became the source of significant portions of the hebrew bible : isaiah 40 – 55 ; ezekiel ; the final version of jeremiah ; the work of the h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized priest ##ly source in the pen ##tate ##uch ; and the final form of the history of israel from de ##uter ##ono ##my to 2 kings . [SEP]
[CLS] theological ##ly , the babylonian exiles were responsible for the doctrines of individual responsibility and universal ##ism ( the concept that one god controls the entire world ) and for the increased emphasis on purity and holiness . [SEP]
[CLS] most significantly , the trauma of the exile experience led to the development of a strong sense of hebrew identity distinct from other peoples , with increased emphasis on symbols such as ci ##rc ##um ##cision and sabbath - ob ##ser ##vance to sustain that distinction . [SEP]
[CLS] the concentration of the biblical literature on the experience of the exiles in babylon disguise ##s the fact that the great majority of the population remained in judah ; for them , life after the fall of jerusalem probably went on much as it had before . [SEP]
[CLS] it may even have improved , as they were rewarded with the land and property of the de ##port ##ees , much to the anger of the community of exiles remaining in babylon . [SEP]
[CLS] the assassination around 58 ##2 of the babylonian governor by a di ##sa ##ffe ##cted member of the former royal house of david provoked a babylonian crack ##down , possibly reflected in the book of lame ##ntation ##s , but the situation seems to have soon stab ##ilised again . [SEP]
[CLS] when babylon fell to the persian cyrus the great in 53 ##9 bce , judah ( or ye ##hu ##d medina ##ta , the " province of ye ##hu ##d " ) became an administrative division within the persian empire . [SEP]
[CLS] cyrus was succeeded as king by cam ##by ##ses , who added egypt to the empire , incident ##ally transforming ye ##hu ##d and the phil ##ist ##ine plain into an important frontier zone . [SEP]
[CLS] darius introduced a reform of the administrative arrangements of the empire including the collection , cod ##ification and administration of local law codes , and it is reasonable to suppose that this policy lay behind the red ##act ##ion of the jewish torah . [SEP]
[CLS] after 404 the persians lost control of egypt , which became persia ' s main rival outside europe , causing the persian authorities to tighten their administrative control over ye ##hu ##d and the rest of the levant . [SEP]
[CLS] ye ##hu ##d ' s population over the entire period was probably never more than about 30 , 000 and that of jerusalem no more than about 1 , 500 , most of them connected in some way to the temple . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the biblical history , one of the first acts of cyrus , the persian conqueror of babylon , was to commission jewish exiles to return to jerusalem and rebuild their temple , a task which they are said to have completed c . 51 ##5 . [SEP]
[CLS] yet it was probably not until the middle of the next century , at the earliest , that jerusalem again became the capital of judah . [SEP]
[CLS] the persians may have experimented initially with ruling ye ##hu ##d as a david ##ic client - kingdom under descendants of je ##ho ##iac ##hin , but by the mid – 5th century bce , ye ##hu ##d had become , in practice , a theo ##cr ##acy , ruled by hereditary high priests , with a persian - appointed governor , frequently jewish , charged with keeping order and seeing that taxes ( tribute ) were collected and paid . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the biblical history , ezra and ne ##hem ##iah arrived in jerusalem in the middle of the 5th century bce , the former empowered by the persian king to enforce the torah , the latter holding the status of governor with a royal commission to restore jerusalem ' s walls . [SEP]
[CLS] the biblical history mentions tension between the return ##ees and those who had remained in ye ##hu ##d , the return ##ees re ##bu ##ffin ##g the attempt of the " peoples of the land " to participate in the rebuilding of the temple ; this attitude was based partly on the ex ##cl ##us ##ivism that the exiles had developed while in babylon and , probably , also partly on disputes over property . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 5th century bce , ezra and ne ##hem ##iah attempted to re - integrate these rival factions into a united and ritual ##ly pure society , inspired by the prop ##he ##cies of ezekiel and his followers . [SEP]
[CLS] the persian era , and especially the period between 53 ##8 and 400 bce , laid the foundations for the unified ju ##dai ##c religion and the beginning of a script ##ural canon . [SEP]
[CLS] other important landmarks in this period include the replacement of hebrew as the everyday language of judah by aramaic ( although hebrew continued to be used for religious and literary purposes ) and darius ' s reform of the empire ' s bureaucracy , which may have led to extensive revisions and reorganization ##s of the jewish torah . [SEP]
[CLS] the israel of the persian period consisted of descendants of the inhabitants of the old kingdom of judah , return ##ees from the babylonian exile community , mesopotamia ##ns who had joined them or had been exiled themselves to sam ##aria at a far earlier period , sam ##ari ##tan ##s , and others . [SEP]
[CLS] when alexander died in 323 , he had no heirs that were able to take his place as ruler of his empire , so his generals divided the empire among themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] at first , relations between se ##le ##uc ##ids and jews were cord ##ial , but the attempt of antioch ##us iv ep ##ip ##hane ##s ( 174 – 163 ) to impose hellenic cult ##s on jude ##a sparked the mac ##ca ##be ##an revolt that ended in the expulsion of the se ##le ##uc ##ids and the establishment of an independent jewish kingdom under the has ##mon ##ean dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] has ##mon ##ean kings attempted to revive the judah described in the bible : a jewish monarchy ruled from jerusalem and including all territories once ruled by david and solomon . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to carry out this project , the has ##mon ##ean ##s forcibly converted one - time mo ##abi ##tes , edo ##mite ##s , and am ##mon ##ites to judaism , as well as the lost kingdom of israel . [SEP]
[CLS] he also took control of ye ##hu ##d medina ##ta in 320 because he was very aware that it was a great place to attack egypt from and was also a great defensive position . [SEP]
[CLS] se ##le ##uc ##us found refuge with ptolemy and they both rallied troops against anti ##gon ##us ’ son demetrius , since anti ##gon ##us had retreated back to asia minor . [SEP]
[CLS] demetrius was defeated at the battle of gaza and ptolemy regained control of ye ##hu ##d medina ##ta . [SEP]
[CLS] however , not soon after this anti ##gon ##us came back and forced ptolemy to retreat back to egypt . [SEP]
[CLS] se ##le ##uc ##us was given the areas of syria and palestine , but ptolemy would not give up those lands , causing the syrian wars between the pt ##ole ##mies and se ##le ##uc ##ids . [SEP]
[CLS] not much is known about the happening ##s of those in ye ##hu ##d medina ##ta from the time of alexander ' s death until the battle of ip ##sus due to the frequent battles . [SEP]
[CLS] he also allowed them to keep their religious practices , so long as they paid their taxes and didn ’ t rebel . [SEP]
[CLS] he was victorious in both the first and second syrian wars , but after trying to end the conflict with the se ##le ##uc ##ids by arranging a marriage between his daughter be ##ren ##ice and the se ##le ##uc ##id king antioch ##us ii , he died . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to enforce his hold on them , he reinforced many cities in palestine and built new ones . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result of this , more greeks and macedonian ##s moved to those new cities and brought over their customs and culture , or hell ##eni ##sm . [SEP]
[CLS] during the end of the third syrian war , the high priest on ##ias ii would not pay the tax to the ptolemy iii eu ##er ##get ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] that and the combination of the ineffective rulers ptolemy iv phil ##opa ##ter and ptolemy v and the might of the large se ##le ##uc ##id army ended the century - long rule of the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic dynasty over palestine . [SEP]
[CLS] he , like the pt ##ole ##mies , let the jews keep their religion and customs and even went so far as to encourage the rebuilding of the temple and city after they welcomed him so warmly into jerusalem . [SEP]
[CLS] however , antioch ##us owed the romans a great deal of money . [SEP]
[CLS] he was informed of this knowledge by a rival of the current high priest on ##ias iii . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##lio ##dor ##us was not allowed into the temple , but it required on ##ias to go explain to the king why one of his ministers was denied access somewhere . [SEP]
[CLS] some of these ways , as stated in the book of 1 mac ##ca ##bee ##s , were the building of a gymnasium , finding ways to hide their ci ##rc ##um ##cision , and just generally not ab ##idi ##ng by the holy covenant . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the book of mac ##ca ##bee ##s , many jews were not happy with the way hell ##eni ##sm had spread into jude ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] there is evidence to show that it was not that simple and that there was negotiation , but l ##ys ##ias still left . [SEP]
[CLS] around this time was the re - dedication of the temple . [SEP]
[CLS] however , l ##ys ##ias had to pull out because of a contradiction of who was to be regent for antioch ##us v . shortly after , both were killed by demetrius i so ##ter who became the new king . [SEP]
[CLS] a group of scribe ##s called the has ##ide ##ans asked him for his word that he would not harm anyone . [SEP]
[CLS] jonathan used this chance to exchange his services of troops for demetrius so that he could take back jerusalem . [SEP]
[CLS] simon was nominated for the title of high priest , general , and leader by a " great assembly " . [SEP]
[CLS] he reached out to rome to have them guarantee that jude ##a would be an independent land . [SEP]
[CLS] his last remaining son , john h ##yr ##can ##us , was supposed to be killed as well , but he was informed of the plan and rushed to jerusalem to keep it safe . [SEP]
[CLS] he had to pay a large sum of money , tear down the walls of the city , acknowledge se ##le ##uc ##id power over jude ##a , and help the se ##le ##uc ##ids fight against the part ##hian ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] john h ##yr ##can ##us also kept good relations with the roman and the egyptians , owing to the large number of jews living there . [SEP]
[CLS] he def ##ied his father ' s wishes that his mother should take over the government and instead had her and all of his brothers except for one thrown in prison . [SEP]
[CLS] after his death , he was succeeded by his brother alexander jan ##nae ##us , who was only concerned with power and conquest . [SEP]
[CLS] after alexander jana ##eau ##s ' death , his widow became ruler , but not high priest . [SEP]
[CLS] the end of the has ##mon ##ean dynasty was in 63 when the romans came at the request of the current priest - king ari ##sto ##bu ##lus ii and his competitor h ##yr ##can ##us ii . [SEP]
[CLS] in 63 bce the roman general po ##mp ##ey conquered jerusalem and the romans put h ##yr ##can ##us ii up as high priest , but jude ##a became a client - kingdom of rome . [SEP]
[CLS] in 40 – 39 bce , hero ##d the great was appointed king of the jews by the roman senate , and in 6 ce the last et ##hn ##ar ##ch of jude ##a was deposed by the emperor augustus , his territories combined with id ##ume ##a and sam ##aria and annexed as i ##uda ##ea province under direct roman administration . [SEP]
[CLS] hen ##oth ##eis ##m is defined in the dictionary as adherence to one god out of several . [SEP]
[CLS] in this transitional period many followers of the israeli ##te religion worship ##ed the god ya ##h ##we ##h but did not deny the existence of other deities accepted throughout the region . [SEP]
[CLS] this concept en ##tail ##ed adopting the gods of other cultures into their pantheon , with ash ##ur as the supreme god of all the others . [SEP]
[CLS] using can ##aan ##ite religion as a base was natural due to the fact that the can ##aan ##ite culture inhabited the same region prior to the emergence of israeli ##te culture . [SEP]
[CLS] el was the creation god and as such it makes sense for the israeli ##te supreme god to adopt el ’ s characteristics . [SEP]
[CLS] mono ##the ##ism in the region of ancient israel and judah did not take hold over night and during the intermediate stages most people are believed to have been hen ##oth ##eis ##tic . [SEP]
[CLS] before the emergence of ya ##h ##we ##h as the patron god of the region of ancient israel and judah not all worship ##ed him alone , or even at all . [SEP]
[CLS] religion was very much centered around the family , as opposed to the community . [SEP]
[CLS] it was not until later on in israeli ##te history that people started to worship ya ##h ##we ##h alone and fully convert to mono ##the ##istic values . [SEP]
[CLS] that switch occurred with the growth of power and influence of the israeli ##te kingdom and its rulers and can be read about further in the iron age ya ##h ##wi ##sm section below . [SEP]
[CLS] many believe that this quote goes to show that the early israeli ##te kingdom followed similar traditions as ancient mesopotamia , where each major urban center had a supreme god . [SEP]
[CLS] each culture then embraced their patron god but did not deny the existence of other cultures ' patron gods . [SEP]
[CLS] in ass ##yria , the patron god was ash ##ur , and in ancient israel , it was ya ##h ##we ##h ; however , both israeli ##te and assyrian cultures recognized each other ' s deities during this period . [SEP]
[CLS] some scholars have used the bible as evidence to argue that most of the people alive during the events recounted in the old testament , including moses , were most likely hen ##oth ##eis ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] this quote does not deny the existence of other gods ; it merely states that jews and christians should consider ya ##h ##we ##h or god the supreme god , inc ##omp ##arable to other supernatural beings . [SEP]
[CLS] earlier influences from mesopotamia and can ##aan were important in creating the foundation of israeli ##te religion consistent with the kingdoms of ancient israel and judah , and have since left lasting impacts on some of the biggest and most widespread religions in our world today . [SEP]
[CLS] the religion of the israeli ##tes of iron age i , like the ancient can ##aan ##ite religion from which it evolved and other religions of the ancient near east , was based on a cult of ancestors and worship of family gods ( the " gods of the fathers " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] with the emergence of the monarchy at the beginning of iron age ii the kings promoted their family god , ya ##h ##we ##h , as the god of the kingdom , but beyond the royal court , religion continued to be both poly ##the ##istic and family - centered . [SEP]
[CLS] at an early stage el and ya ##h ##we ##h became fused and asher ##ah did not continue as a separate state cult , although she continued to be popular at a community level until persian times . [SEP]
[CLS] ya ##h ##we ##h , the national god of both israel and judah , seems to have originated in edo ##m and midi ##an in southern can ##aan and may have been brought to israel by the ken ##ites and midi ##ani ##tes at an early stage . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a general consensus among scholars that the first format ##ive event in the emergence of the distinctive religion described in the bible was triggered by the destruction of israel by ass ##yria in c . 72 ##2 bce . [SEP]
[CLS] this religion was subsequently adopted by the landowners of judah , who in 640 bce placed the eight - year - old josiah on the throne . [SEP]
[CLS] judah at this time was a vassal state of ass ##yria , but assyrian power collapsed in the 630 ##s , and around 62 ##2 josiah and his supporters launched a bid for independence expressed as loyalty to " ya ##h ##we ##h alone " . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the de ##uter ##ono ##mist ##s , as scholars call these jude ##an nationalists , the treaty with ya ##h ##we ##h would enable israel ' s god to preserve both the city and the king in return for the people ' s worship and obedience . [SEP]
[CLS] the destruction of jerusalem , its temple , and the david ##ic dynasty by babylon in 58 ##7 / 58 ##6 bce was deeply traumatic and led to revisions of the national myth ##os during the babylonian exile . [SEP]
[CLS] judges , samuel and kings , which interpreted the babylonian destruction as divine ##ly - ordained punishment for the failure of israel ' s kings to worship ya ##h ##we ##h to the exclusion of all other deities . [SEP]
[CLS] strict mono ##the ##ism emerged among the priests of the temple establishment during the seventh and sixth centuries bce , as did beliefs regarding angels and demons . [SEP]
[CLS] at this time , ci ##rc ##um ##cision , dietary laws , and sabbath - ob ##ser ##vance gained more significance as symbols of jewish identity , and the institution of the synagogue became increasingly important , and most of the biblical literature , including the torah , was written or substantially revised during this time .
