[CLS] the kingdom of israel and the kingdom of judah were related kingdoms from the iron age period of the ancient levant . [SEP]
[CLS] the kingdom of israel emerged as an important local power by the 10th century bce before falling to the neo - assyrian empire in 72 ##2 bce . [SEP]
[CLS] israel ' s southern neighbor , the kingdom of judah , emerged in the 8th or 9th century bce and later became a client state of first the neo - assyrian empire and then the neo - babylonian empire before a revolt against the latter led to its destruction in 58 ##6 bce . [SEP]
[CLS] following the fall of babylon to the ac ##hae ##men ##id empire under cyrus the great in 53 ##9 bce , some jude ##an exiles returned to jerusalem , ina ##ug ##ura ##ting the format ##ive period in the development of a distinctive judah ##ite identity in the province of ye ##hu ##d medina ##ta . [SEP]
[CLS] during the hellenistic classic period , ye ##hu ##d was absorbed into the subsequent hellenistic kingdoms that followed the conquest ##s of alexander the great , but in the 2nd century bce the ju ##dae ##ans revolt ##ed against the se ##le ##uc ##id empire and created the has ##mon ##ean kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] this , the last nominally independent kingdom of israel , gradually lost its independence from 63 bce with its conquest by po ##mp ##ey of rome , becoming a roman and later part ##hian client kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] following the installation of client kingdoms under the hero ##dian dynasty , the province of jude ##a was wr ##ack ##ed by civil disturbances , which culminated in the first jewish – roman war , the destruction of the second temple , the emergence of rabbi ##nic judaism and early christianity . [SEP]
[CLS] the name jude ##a ( i ##uda ##ea ) ceased to be used by greco - romans after the bar koch ##ba revolt of 135 ce . [SEP]
[CLS] the eastern mediterranean sea ##board the levant stretches 400 miles north to south from the tau ##rus mountains to the sinai peninsula , and 70 to 100 miles east to west between the sea and the arabian desert . [SEP]
[CLS] the coastal plain of the southern levant , broad in the south and narrowing to the north , is backed in its southernmost portion by a zone of foothills , the sh ##fe ##la ; like the plain this narrows as it goes northwards , ending in the promo ##nto ##ry of mount carmel . [SEP]
[CLS] east of the plain and the sh ##fe ##la is a mountainous ridge , the " hill country of judah " in the south , the " hill country of ep ##hra ##im " north of that , then galilee and mount lebanon . [SEP]
[CLS] to the east again lie the steep - sided valley occupied by the jordan river , the dead sea , and the wadi of the arab ##ah , which continues down to the eastern arm of the red sea . [SEP]
[CLS] beyond the plateau is the syrian desert , separating the levant from mesopotamia . [SEP]
[CLS] to the southwest is egypt , to the northeast mesopotamia . [SEP]
[CLS] the location and geographical characteristics of the narrow levant made the area a battle ##ground among the powerful entities that surrounded it . [SEP]
[CLS] can ##aan in the late bronze age was a shadow of what it had been centuries earlier : many cities were abandoned , others sh ##rank in size , and the total settled population was probably not much more than a hundred thousand . [SEP]
[CLS] settlement was concentrated in cities along the coastal plain and along major communication routes ; the central and northern hill country which would later become the biblical kingdom of israel was only sparsely inhabited although letters from the egyptian archives indicate that jerusalem was already a can ##aan ##ite city - state rec ##og ##nis ##ing egyptian over ##lord ##ship . [SEP]
[CLS] politically and culturally it was dominated by egypt , each city under its own ruler , constantly at odds with its neighbours , and appealing to the egyptians to ad ##ju ##dicate their differences . [SEP]
[CLS] the can ##aan ##ite city state system broke down during the late bronze age collapse , and can ##aan ##ite culture was then gradually absorbed into that of the phil ##ist ##ines , ph ##oe ##nic ##ians and israeli ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] the process was gradual and a strong egyptian presence continued into the 12th century bce , and , while some can ##aan ##ite cities were destroyed , others continued to exist in iron age i . [SEP]
[CLS] the name " israel " first appears in the mer ##ne ##pta ##h ste ##le c . 120 ##9 bce : " israel is laid waste and his seed is no more . " [SEP]
[CLS] this " israel " was a cultural and probably political entity , well enough established for the egyptians to perceive it as a possible challenge , but an ethnic group rather than an organised state ; archaeologist paula mc ##nut ##t says : " it is probably . . . during iron age i that a population began to identify itself as ' israeli ##te ' , " different ##iating itself from its neighbours via prohibition ##s on inter ##mar ##ria ##ge , an emphasis on family history and genealogy , and religion . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late bronze age there were no more than about 25 villages in the highlands , but this increased to over 300 by the end of iron age i , while the settled population doubled from 20 , 000 to 40 , 000 . [SEP]
[CLS] the villages were more numerous and larger in the north , and probably shared the highlands with pastoral no ##mad ##s , who left no remains . [SEP]
[CLS] archaeologists and historians attempting to trace the origins of these villagers have found it impossible to identify any distinctive features that could define them as specifically israeli ##te collar ##ed - rim jars and four - room houses have been identified outside the highlands and thus cannot be used to distinguish israeli ##te sites , and while the pottery of the highland villages is far more limited than that of lowland can ##aan ##ite sites , it develops ty ##pol ##ogical ##ly out of can ##aan ##ite pottery that came before . [SEP]
[CLS] israel fin ##kel ##stein proposed that the oval or circular layout that distinguishes some of the earliest highland sites , and the notable absence of pig bones from hill sites , could be taken as markers of ethnicity , but others have caution ##ed that these can be a " common - sense " adaptation to highland life and not necessarily rev ##ela ##tory of origins . [SEP]
[CLS] other ara ##ma ##ean sites also demonstrate a contemporary absence of pig remains at that time , unlike earlier can ##aan ##ite and later phil ##ist ##ine excavations . [SEP]
[CLS] in " the bible unearthed " ( 2001 ) , fin ##kel ##stein and si ##lb ##erman sum ##mar ##ised recent studies . [SEP]
[CLS] they described how , up until 1967 , the israeli ##te heartland in the highlands of western palestine was virtually an archaeological " terra inc ##og ##ni ##ta " . [SEP]
[CLS] since then , intensive surveys have examined the traditional territories of the tribes of judah , benjamin , ep ##hra ##im , and mana ##sse ##h . [SEP]
[CLS] these surveys have revealed the sudden emergence of a new culture contrasting with the phil ##ist ##ine and can ##aan ##ite societies existing in the land of israel earlier during iron age i . [SEP]
[CLS] this new culture is characterised by a lack of pork remains ( whereas pork formed 20 % of the phil ##ist ##ine diet in places ) , by an abandonment of the phil ##ist ##ine / can ##aan ##ite custom of having highly decorated pottery , and by the practice of ci ##rc ##um ##cision . [SEP]
[CLS] the israeli ##te ethnic identity had originated , not from the exodus and a subsequent conquest , but from a transformation of the existing can ##aan ##ite - phil ##ist ##ine cultures . [SEP]
[CLS] modern scholars therefore see israel arising peacefully and internally from existing people in the highlands of can ##aan . [SEP]
[CLS] unusually favourable climatic conditions in the first two centuries of iron age ii brought about an expansion of population , settlements and trade throughout the region . [SEP]
[CLS] in the central highlands this resulted in unification in a kingdom with the city of sam ##aria as its capital , possibly by the second half of the 10th century bce when an inscription of the egyptian pharaoh sho ##sh ##en ##q i , the biblical shi ##sha ##k , records a series of campaigns directed at the area . [SEP]
[CLS] israel had clearly emerged by the middle of the 9th century bce , when the assyrian king sha ##lman ##ese ##r iii names " ah ##ab the israeli ##te " among his enemies at the battle of q ##ar ##qa ##r ( 85 ##3 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] at this time israel was apparently engaged in a three - way contest with damascus and tyre for control of the je ##z ##ree ##l valley and galilee in the north , and with mo ##ab , am ##mon and ara ##m damascus in the east for control of gil ##ead ; the mesh ##a ste ##le ( c . 83 ##0 ) , left by a king of mo ##ab , celebrates his success in throwing off the oppression of the " house of om ##ri " ( i . e . , israel ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it bears what is generally thought to be the earliest extra - biblical reference to the name " ya ##h ##we ##h " . [SEP]
[CLS] a century later israel came into increasing conflict with the expanding neo - assyrian empire , which first split its territory into several smaller units and then destroyed its capital , sam ##aria ( 72 ##2 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] both the biblical and assyrian sources speak of a massive deportation of people from israel and their replacement with settlers from other parts of the empire such population exchanges were an established part of assyrian imperial policy , a means of breaking the old power structure and the former israel never again became an independent political entity . [SEP]
[CLS] judah emerged somewhat later than israel , probably during the 9th century bce , but the subject is one of considerable controversy . [SEP]
[CLS] there are indications that during the 10th and 9th centuries bce , the southern highlands had been divided between a number of centres , none with clear prima ##cy . [SEP]
[CLS] during the reign of he ##zek ##iah , between c . 71 ##5 and 68 ##6 bce , a notable increase in the power of the jude ##an state can be observed . [SEP]
[CLS] this is reflected in archaeological sites and findings , such as the broad wall ; a defensive city wall in jerusalem ; and the si ##lo ##am tunnel , an aqueduct designed to provide jerusalem with water during an impending siege by the neo - assyrian empire led by sen ##nac ##her ##ib ; and the si ##lo ##am inscription , a lin ##tel inscription found over the doorway of a tomb , has been ascribed to com ##pt ##roller she ##bn ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] l ##ml ##k seals on storage jar handles , excavated from strata in and around that formed by sen ##nac ##her ##ib ' s destruction , appear to have been used throughout sen ##nac ##her ##ib ' s 29 - year reign , along with bull ##ae from sealed documents , some that belonged to he ##zek ##iah himself and others that name his servants . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 7th century jerusalem grew to contain a population many times greater than earlier and achieved clear dominance over its neighbours . [SEP]
[CLS] this occurred at the same time that israel was being destroyed by the neo - assyrian empire , and was probably the result of a cooperative arrangement with the assyrian ##s to establish judah as an assyrian vassal state controlling the valuable olive industry . [SEP]
[CLS] judah pro ##sper ##ed as a vassal state ( despite a disastrous rebellion against sen ##nac ##her ##ib ) , but in the last half of the 7th century bce , ass ##yria suddenly collapsed , and the ensuing competition between egypt and the neo - babylonian empire for control of the land led to the destruction of judah in a series of campaigns between 59 ##7 and 58 ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] babylonian judah suffered a steep decline in both economy and population and lost the ne ##ge ##v , the she ##ph ##ela ##h , and part of the jude ##an hill country , including he ##bron , to en ##cr ##oa ##chment ##s from edo ##m and other neighbours . [SEP]
[CLS] jerusalem , while probably not totally abandoned , was much smaller than previously , and the town of mi ##z ##pa ##h in benjamin in the relatively un ##sca ##thed northern section of the kingdom became the capital of the new babylonian province of ye ##hu ##d medina ##ta . [SEP]
[CLS] ( this was standard babylonian practice : when the phil ##ist ##ine city of ash ##kal ##on was conquered in 60 ##4 , the political , religious and economic elite but not the bulk of the population was banished and the administrative centre shifted to a new location ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there is also a strong probability that for most or all of the period the temple at bethel in benjamin replaced that at jerusalem , boost ##ing the prestige of bethel ' s priests ( the aaron ##ites ) against those of jerusalem ( the za ##do ##kit ##es ) , now in exile in babylon . [SEP]
[CLS] the babylonian conquest en ##tail ##ed not just the destruction of jerusalem and its temple , but the liquidation of the entire infrastructure which had sustained judah for centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] the most significant casualty was the state ideology of " zion theology , " the idea that the god of israel had chosen jerusalem for his dwelling - place and that the david ##ic dynasty would reign there forever . [SEP]
[CLS] the fall of the city and the end of david ##ic kings ##hip forced the leaders of the exile community kings , priests , scribe ##s and prophets to reform ##ulate the concepts of community , faith and politics . [SEP]
[CLS] the exile community in babylon thus became the source of significant portions of the hebrew bible : isaiah 40 – 55 ; ezekiel ; the final version of jeremiah ; the work of the h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized priest ##ly source in the pen ##tate ##uch ; and the final form of the history of israel from de ##uter ##ono ##my to 2 kings . [SEP]
[CLS] theological ##ly , the babylonian exiles were responsible for the doctrines of individual responsibility and universal ##ism ( the concept that one god controls the entire world ) and for the increased emphasis on purity and holiness . [SEP]
[CLS] most significantly , the trauma of the exile experience led to the development of a strong sense of hebrew identity distinct from other peoples , with increased emphasis on symbols such as ci ##rc ##um ##cision and sabbath - ob ##ser ##vance to sustain that distinction . [SEP]
[CLS] the concentration of the biblical literature on the experience of the exiles in babylon disguise ##s the fact that the great majority of the population remained in judah ; for them , life after the fall of jerusalem probably went on much as it had before . [SEP]
[CLS] it may even have improved , as they were rewarded with the land and property of the de ##port ##ees , much to the anger of the community of exiles remaining in babylon . [SEP]
[CLS] the assassination around 58 ##2 of the babylonian governor by a di ##sa ##ffe ##cted member of the former royal house of david provoked a babylonian crack ##down , possibly reflected in the book of lame ##ntation ##s , but the situation seems to have soon stab ##ilised again . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , those un ##wall ##ed cities and towns that remained were subject to slave raids by the ph ##oe ##nic ##ians and intervention in their internal affairs by sam ##ari ##tan ##s , arabs , and am ##mon ##ites . [SEP]
[CLS] when babylon fell to the persian cyrus the great in 53 ##9 bce , judah ( or ye ##hu ##d medina ##ta , the " province of ye ##hu ##d " ) became an administrative division within the persian empire . [SEP]
[CLS] cyrus was succeeded as king by cam ##by ##ses , who added egypt to the empire , incident ##ally transforming ye ##hu ##d and the phil ##ist ##ine plain into an important frontier zone . [SEP]
[CLS] his death in 52 ##2 was followed by a period of turmoil until darius the great seized the throne in about 521 . [SEP]
[CLS] darius introduced a reform of the administrative arrangements of the empire including the collection , cod ##ification and administration of local law codes , and it is reasonable to suppose that this policy lay behind the red ##act ##ion of the jewish torah . [SEP]
[CLS] after 404 the persians lost control of egypt , which became persia ' s main rival outside europe , causing the persian authorities to tighten their administrative control over ye ##hu ##d and the rest of the levant . [SEP]
[CLS] egypt was eventually rec ##on ##que ##red , but soon afterward persia fell to alexander the great , usher ##ing in the hellenistic period in the levant . [SEP]
[CLS] ye ##hu ##d ' s population over the entire period was probably never more than about 30 , 000 and that of jerusalem no more than about 1 , 500 , most of them connected in some way to the temple . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the biblical history , one of the first acts of cyrus , the persian conqueror of babylon , was to commission jewish exiles to return to jerusalem and rebuild their temple , a task which they are said to have completed c . 51 ##5 . [SEP]
[CLS] yet it was probably not until the middle of the next century , at the earliest , that jerusalem again became the capital of judah . [SEP]
[CLS] the persians may have experimented initially with ruling ye ##hu ##d as a david ##ic client - kingdom under descendants of je ##ho ##iac ##hin , but by the mid – 5th century bce , ye ##hu ##d had become , in practice , a theo ##cr ##acy , ruled by hereditary high priests , with a persian - appointed governor , frequently jewish , charged with keeping order and seeing that taxes ( tribute ) were collected and paid . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the biblical history , ezra and ne ##hem ##iah arrived in jerusalem in the middle of the 5th century bce , the former empowered by the persian king to enforce the torah , the latter holding the status of governor with a royal commission to restore jerusalem ' s walls . [SEP]
[CLS] the biblical history mentions tension between the return ##ees and those who had remained in ye ##hu ##d , the return ##ees re ##bu ##ffin ##g the attempt of the " peoples of the land " to participate in the rebuilding of the temple ; this attitude was based partly on the ex ##cl ##us ##ivism that the exiles had developed while in babylon and , probably , also partly on disputes over property . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 5th century bce , ezra and ne ##hem ##iah attempted to re - integrate these rival factions into a united and ritual ##ly pure society , inspired by the prop ##he ##cies of ezekiel and his followers . [SEP]
[CLS] the persian era , and especially the period between 53 ##8 and 400 bce , laid the foundations for the unified ju ##dai ##c religion and the beginning of a script ##ural canon . [SEP]
[CLS] other important landmarks in this period include the replacement of hebrew as the everyday language of judah by aramaic ( although hebrew continued to be used for religious and literary purposes ) and darius ' s reform of the empire ' s bureaucracy , which may have led to extensive revisions and reorganization ##s of the jewish torah . [SEP]
[CLS] the israel of the persian period consisted of descendants of the inhabitants of the old kingdom of judah , return ##ees from the babylonian exile community , mesopotamia ##ns who had joined them or had been exiled themselves to sam ##aria at a far earlier period , sam ##ari ##tan ##s , and others . [SEP]
[CLS] the beginning of the hellenistic period is marked by the conquest of alexander the great ( 333 bce ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when alexander died in 323 , he had no heirs that were able to take his place as ruler of his empire , so his generals divided the empire among themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] ptolemy i asserted himself as the ruler of egypt in 322 and seized ye ##hu ##d medina ##ta in 320 , but his successors lost it in 198 to the se ##le ##uc ##ids of syria . [SEP]
[CLS] at first , relations between se ##le ##uc ##ids and jews were cord ##ial , but the attempt of antioch ##us iv ep ##ip ##hane ##s ( 174 – 163 ) to impose hellenic cult ##s on jude ##a sparked the mac ##ca ##be ##an revolt that ended in the expulsion of the se ##le ##uc ##ids and the establishment of an independent jewish kingdom under the has ##mon ##ean dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] some modern commentators see this period also as a civil war between orthodox and hell ##eni ##zed jews . [SEP]
[CLS] has ##mon ##ean kings attempted to revive the judah described in the bible : a jewish monarchy ruled from jerusalem and including all territories once ruled by david and solomon . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to carry out this project , the has ##mon ##ean ##s forcibly converted one - time mo ##abi ##tes , edo ##mite ##s , and am ##mon ##ites to judaism , as well as the lost kingdom of israel . [SEP]
[CLS] some scholars argue that the has ##mon ##ean dynasty institutional ##ized the final jewish biblical canon . [SEP]
[CLS] ptolemy i took control of egypt in 322 bce after the death of alexander the great . [SEP]
[CLS] he also took control of ye ##hu ##d medina ##ta in 320 because he was very aware that it was a great place to attack egypt from and was also a great defensive position . [SEP]
[CLS] however , there were others who also had their eyes on that area . [SEP]
[CLS] another former general , anti ##gon ##us mono ##ph ##thal ##mus , had driven out the sat ##ra ##p of babylon , se ##le ##uc ##us , in 317 and continued on towards the levant . [SEP]
[CLS] se ##le ##uc ##us found refuge with ptolemy and they both rallied troops against anti ##gon ##us ’ son demetrius , since anti ##gon ##us had retreated back to asia minor . [SEP]
[CLS] demetrius was defeated at the battle of gaza and ptolemy regained control of ye ##hu ##d medina ##ta . [SEP]
[CLS] however , not soon after this anti ##gon ##us came back and forced ptolemy to retreat back to egypt . [SEP]
[CLS] this went on until the battle of ip ##sus in 301 where se ##le ##uc ##us ' armies defeated anti ##gon ##us . [SEP]
[CLS] se ##le ##uc ##us was given the areas of syria and palestine , but ptolemy would not give up those lands , causing the syrian wars between the pt ##ole ##mies and se ##le ##uc ##ids . [SEP]
[CLS] not much is known about the happening ##s of those in ye ##hu ##d medina ##ta from the time of alexander ' s death until the battle of ip ##sus due to the frequent battles . [SEP]
[CLS] at first , the jews were content with ptolemy ' s rule over them . [SEP]
[CLS] his reign brought them peace and economic stability . [SEP]
[CLS] he also allowed them to keep their religious practices , so long as they paid their taxes and didn ’ t rebel . [SEP]
[CLS] after ptolemy i came ptolemy ii phil ##ade ##lp ##hus , who was able to keep the territory of ye ##hu ##d medina ##ta and brought the dynasty to the peak of its power . [SEP]
[CLS] he was victorious in both the first and second syrian wars , but after trying to end the conflict with the se ##le ##uc ##ids by arranging a marriage between his daughter be ##ren ##ice and the se ##le ##uc ##id king antioch ##us ii , he died . [SEP]
[CLS] the arranged marriage did not work and be ##ren ##ice , antioch ##us , and their child were killed from an order of antioch ##us ' former wife . [SEP]
[CLS] this was one of the reasons for the third syrian war . [SEP]
[CLS] before all of this , ptolemy ii fought and defeated the na ##bat ##aea ##ns . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to enforce his hold on them , he reinforced many cities in palestine and built new ones . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result of this , more greeks and macedonian ##s moved to those new cities and brought over their customs and culture , or hell ##eni ##sm . [SEP]
[CLS] the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic rule also gave rise to ' tax farmers ' . [SEP]
[CLS] these were the bigger farmers who collected the high taxes of the smaller farmers . [SEP]
[CLS] these farmers made a lot of money off of this , but it also put a rift between the aristocracy and everyone else . [SEP]
[CLS] during the end of the third syrian war , the high priest on ##ias ii would not pay the tax to the ptolemy iii eu ##er ##get ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] it is thought that this shows a turning point in the jew ' s support of the pt ##ole ##mies . [SEP]
[CLS] the fourth and fifth syrian wars marked the end of the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic control of palestine . [SEP]
[CLS] both of these wars hurt palestine more than the previous three . [SEP]
[CLS] that and the combination of the ineffective rulers ptolemy iv phil ##opa ##ter and ptolemy v and the might of the large se ##le ##uc ##id army ended the century - long rule of the pt ##ole ##ma ##ic dynasty over palestine . [SEP]
[CLS] the se ##le ##uc ##id rule of palestine began in 198 bce under antioch ##us iii . [SEP]
[CLS] he , like the pt ##ole ##mies , let the jews keep their religion and customs and even went so far as to encourage the rebuilding of the temple and city after they welcomed him so warmly into jerusalem . [SEP]
[CLS] however , antioch ##us owed the romans a great deal of money . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to raise this money , he decided to rob a temple . [SEP]
[CLS] the people at the temple of bel in el ##am were not pleased , so they killed antioch ##us and everyone helping him in 187 bce . [SEP]
[CLS] he was succeeded by his son se ##le ##uc ##us iv phil ##opa ##ter . [SEP]
[CLS] he simply defended the area of palestine from ptolemy v before being murdered by his minister in 175 . [SEP]
[CLS] his brother antioch ##us iv ep ##ip ##hane ##s took his place . [SEP]
[CLS] before he killed the king , the minister he ##lio ##dor ##us had tried to steal the treasures the temple in jerusalem . [SEP]
[CLS] he was informed of this knowledge by a rival of the current high priest on ##ias iii . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##lio ##dor ##us was not allowed into the temple , but it required on ##ias to go explain to the king why one of his ministers was denied access somewhere . [SEP]
[CLS] in his absence , his rivals put up a new high priest . [SEP]
[CLS] on ##ias ' brother jason ( a hell ##eni ##zed version of joshua ) took his place . [SEP]
[CLS] now with jason as high priest and antioch ##us iv as king , many jews adopted hellenistic ways . [SEP]
[CLS] some of these ways , as stated in the book of 1 mac ##ca ##bee ##s , were the building of a gymnasium , finding ways to hide their ci ##rc ##um ##cision , and just generally not ab ##idi ##ng by the holy covenant . [SEP]
[CLS] this leads to the beginning of the mac ##ca ##be ##an revolt . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the book of mac ##ca ##bee ##s , many jews were not happy with the way hell ##eni ##sm had spread into jude ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] some of these jews were matt ##athi ##as and his sons . [SEP]
[CLS] matt ##athi ##as refused to offer sacrifice when the king told him to . [SEP]
[CLS] he killed a jew who was going to do so as well as the king ' s representative . [SEP]
[CLS] because of this , matt ##athi ##as and his sons had to flee . [SEP]
[CLS] this marks the true beginning of the mac ##ca ##be ##an revolt . [SEP]
[CLS] judas mac ##ca ##be ##us became the leader of the rebels . [SEP]
[CLS] he proved to be a successful general , defeating an army lead by apollo ##nius . [SEP]
[CLS] they started to catch the attention of king antioch ##us iv in 165 , who told his chancellor to put and end to the revolt . [SEP]
[CLS] the chancellor , l ##ys ##ias , sent three generals to do just that , but they were all defeated by the mac ##ca ##bee ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] soon after , l ##ys ##ias went himself but , according to 1 and 2 mac ##ca ##bee ##s he is defeated . [SEP]
[CLS] there is evidence to show that it was not that simple and that there was negotiation , but l ##ys ##ias still left . [SEP]
[CLS] after the death of antioch ##us iv in 164 , his son , antioch ##us v , gave the jews religious freedom . [SEP]
[CLS] l ##ys ##ias claimed to be his regent . [SEP]
[CLS] around this time was the re - dedication of the temple . [SEP]
[CLS] during the siege of the ac ##ra , one of judas ' brothers , el ##ea ##zo ##r , was killed . [SEP]
[CLS] the mac ##ca ##bee ##s had to retreat back to jerusalem , where they should have been beaten badly . [SEP]
[CLS] however , l ##ys ##ias had to pull out because of a contradiction of who was to be regent for antioch ##us v . shortly after , both were killed by demetrius i so ##ter who became the new king . [SEP]
[CLS] the new high priest , al ##ci ##mus , had come to jerusalem with the company of an army lead by ba ##cchi ##des . [SEP]
[CLS] a group of scribe ##s called the has ##ide ##ans asked him for his word that he would not harm anyone . [SEP]
[CLS] he agreed , but killed sixty of them . [SEP]
[CLS] around this time judas is able to make a treaty with the romans . [SEP]
[CLS] soon after this , judas is killed in jerusalem fighting ba ##cchi ##des ' army . [SEP]
[CLS] his brother jonathan succeeds him . [SEP]
[CLS] for eight years , jonathan doesn ' t do much . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in 153 the se ##le ##uc ##id empire started to face some problems . [SEP]
[CLS] jonathan used this chance to exchange his services of troops for demetrius so that he could take back jerusalem . [SEP]
[CLS] he was appointed high priest by alexander bala ##s for the same thing . [SEP]
[CLS] when conflicts between egypt and the se ##le ##uc ##ids arose , jonathan occupied the ac ##ra . [SEP]
[CLS] as conflicts over the throne arose , he completely took control of the ac ##ra . [SEP]
[CLS] but in 142 he was killed . [SEP]
[CLS] his brother simon took his place . [SEP]
[CLS] simon was nominated for the title of high priest , general , and leader by a " great assembly " . [SEP]
[CLS] he reached out to rome to have them guarantee that jude ##a would be an independent land . [SEP]
[CLS] antioch ##us vii wanted the cities of ga ##dara , jo ##ppa , and the ac ##ra back . [SEP]
[CLS] he also wanted a very large tribute . [SEP]
[CLS] simon only wanted to pay a fraction of that for only two of the cites , so antioch ##us sent his general ce ##nde ##ba ##eus to attack . [SEP]
[CLS] the general was killed and the army fled . [SEP]
[CLS] simon and two of his sons were killed in a plot to overthrow the has ##mon ##ean ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] his last remaining son , john h ##yr ##can ##us , was supposed to be killed as well , but he was informed of the plan and rushed to jerusalem to keep it safe . [SEP]
[CLS] h ##yr ##can ##us had many issues to deal with as the new high priest . [SEP]
[CLS] antioch ##us invaded jude ##a and besieged jerusalem in 134 bce . [SEP]
[CLS] due to lack of food , h ##yr ##can ##us had to make a deal with antioch ##us . [SEP]
[CLS] he had to pay a large sum of money , tear down the walls of the city , acknowledge se ##le ##uc ##id power over jude ##a , and help the se ##le ##uc ##ids fight against the part ##hian ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] h ##yr ##can ##us agreed to this , but the war against the part ##hian ##s didn ' t work and antioch ##us died in 128 . [SEP]
[CLS] h ##yr ##can ##us was able to take back jude ##a and keep his power . [SEP]
[CLS] john h ##yr ##can ##us also kept good relations with the roman and the egyptians , owing to the large number of jews living there . [SEP]
[CLS] ari ##sto ##bu ##lus i was the first has ##mon ##ean priest - king . [SEP]
[CLS] he def ##ied his father ' s wishes that his mother should take over the government and instead had her and all of his brothers except for one thrown in prison . [SEP]
[CLS] the one not thrown in prison was later killed on his orders . [SEP]
[CLS] the most significant thing he did during his one - year - reign was conquer most of it ##ura ##ea . [SEP]
[CLS] after his death , he was succeeded by his brother alexander jan ##nae ##us , who was only concerned with power and conquest . [SEP]
[CLS] he also married his brother ' s widow , showing little respect for jewish law . [SEP]
[CLS] his first conquest was pt ##ole ##ma ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] the people called to ptolemy ix for aid , as he was in cyprus . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it was his mother , cleopatra iii , who came to help alexander and not her son . [SEP]
[CLS] alexander was not a popular ruler . [SEP]
[CLS] this caused a civil war in jerusalem that lasted for six years . [SEP]
[CLS] after alexander jana ##eau ##s ' death , his widow became ruler , but not high priest . [SEP]
[CLS] the end of the has ##mon ##ean dynasty was in 63 when the romans came at the request of the current priest - king ari ##sto ##bu ##lus ii and his competitor h ##yr ##can ##us ii . [SEP]
[CLS] in 63 bce the roman general po ##mp ##ey conquered jerusalem and the romans put h ##yr ##can ##us ii up as high priest , but jude ##a became a client - kingdom of rome . [SEP]
[CLS] the dynasty came to an end in 40 bce when hero ##d was crowned king of judah by the romans . [SEP]
[CLS] with their help , hero ##d had seized jerusalem by 37 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 40 – 39 bce , hero ##d the great was appointed king of the jews by the roman senate , and in 6 ce the last et ##hn ##ar ##ch of jude ##a was deposed by the emperor augustus , his territories combined with id ##ume ##a and sam ##aria and annexed as i ##uda ##ea province under direct roman administration . [SEP]
[CLS] hen ##oth ##eis ##m is defined in the dictionary as adherence to one god out of several . [SEP]
[CLS] many scholars believe that before mono ##the ##ism in ancient israel came a transitional period in between poly ##the ##ism and mono ##the ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] in this transitional period many followers of the israeli ##te religion worship ##ed the god ya ##h ##we ##h but did not deny the existence of other deities accepted throughout the region . [SEP]
[CLS] some scholars attribute this hen ##oth ##eis ##tic period to influences from mesopotamia . [SEP]
[CLS] there are strong arguments that mesopotamia , particularly ass ##yria shared the concept of the cult of ash ##ur with israel . [SEP]
[CLS] this concept en ##tail ##ed adopting the gods of other cultures into their pantheon , with ash ##ur as the supreme god of all the others . [SEP]
[CLS] this concept is believed to have influenced the transitional period in israeli ##te religion in which many people were hen ##oth ##eis ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] israeli ##te religion shares many characteristics with can ##aan ##ite religion , which itself was formed with influence from mesopotamia ##n religious traditions . [SEP]
[CLS] using can ##aan ##ite religion as a base was natural due to the fact that the can ##aan ##ite culture inhabited the same region prior to the emergence of israeli ##te culture . [SEP]
[CLS] can ##aan ##ite religion was a poly ##the ##istic religion in which many gods represented unique concepts . [SEP]
[CLS] most scholars agree that the israeli ##te god of ya ##h ##we ##h was adopted from the can ##aan ##ite god el . [SEP]
[CLS] el was the creation god and as such it makes sense for the israeli ##te supreme god to adopt el ’ s characteristics . [SEP]
[CLS] mono ##the ##ism in the region of ancient israel and judah did not take hold over night and during the intermediate stages most people are believed to have been hen ##oth ##eis ##tic . [SEP]
[CLS] before the emergence of ya ##h ##we ##h as the patron god of the region of ancient israel and judah not all worship ##ed him alone , or even at all . [SEP]
[CLS] during this intermediate period of hen ##oth ##eis ##m many families worship ##ed different gods . [SEP]
[CLS] religion was very much centered around the family , as opposed to the community . [SEP]
[CLS] people sparsely populated the region of israel and judah during the time of moses . [SEP]
[CLS] as such many different areas worship ##ed different gods , due to social isolation . [SEP]
[CLS] it was not until later on in israeli ##te history that people started to worship ya ##h ##we ##h alone and fully convert to mono ##the ##istic values . [SEP]
[CLS] that switch occurred with the growth of power and influence of the israeli ##te kingdom and its rulers and can be read about further in the iron age ya ##h ##wi ##sm section below . [SEP]
[CLS] evidence from the bible suggests that hen ##oth ##eis ##m did exist : " they the hebrew ##s went and served alien gods and paid homage to them , gods of whom they had no experience and whom he ya ##h ##we ##h did not all ##ot to them " . [SEP]
[CLS] many believe that this quote goes to show that the early israeli ##te kingdom followed similar traditions as ancient mesopotamia , where each major urban center had a supreme god . [SEP]
[CLS] each culture then embraced their patron god but did not deny the existence of other cultures ' patron gods . [SEP]
[CLS] in ass ##yria , the patron god was ash ##ur , and in ancient israel , it was ya ##h ##we ##h ; however , both israeli ##te and assyrian cultures recognized each other ' s deities during this period . [SEP]
[CLS] some scholars have used the bible as evidence to argue that most of the people alive during the events recounted in the old testament , including moses , were most likely hen ##oth ##eis ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many quotes from the old testament support this point of view . [SEP]
[CLS] one quote from jewish and christian tradition that supports this claim is the first command ##ment which in its entirety reads " i am the lord your god , who brought you out of the land of egypt , out of the house of bond ##age . [SEP]
[CLS] you shall have no other gods before me . " [SEP]
[CLS] this quote does not deny the existence of other gods ; it merely states that jews and christians should consider ya ##h ##we ##h or god the supreme god , inc ##omp ##arable to other supernatural beings . [SEP]
[CLS] some scholars attribute the concept of angels and demons found in judaism and christianity to the tradition of hen ##oth ##eis ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of completely getting rid of the concept of other supernatural beings , these religions changed former deities into angels and demons . [SEP]
[CLS] ya ##h ##we ##h became the supreme god governing angels , demons and humans , with angels and demons considered more powerful than the average human . [SEP]
[CLS] this tradition of believing in multiple forms of supernatural beings is attributed by many to the traditions of ancient mesopotamia and can ##aan and their pantheon ##s of gods . [SEP]
[CLS] earlier influences from mesopotamia and can ##aan were important in creating the foundation of israeli ##te religion consistent with the kingdoms of ancient israel and judah , and have since left lasting impacts on some of the biggest and most widespread religions in our world today . [SEP]
[CLS] the religion of the israeli ##tes of iron age i , like the ancient can ##aan ##ite religion from which it evolved and other religions of the ancient near east , was based on a cult of ancestors and worship of family gods ( the " gods of the fathers " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] with the emergence of the monarchy at the beginning of iron age ii the kings promoted their family god , ya ##h ##we ##h , as the god of the kingdom , but beyond the royal court , religion continued to be both poly ##the ##istic and family - centered . [SEP]
[CLS] the major deities were not numerous el , asher ##ah , and ya ##h ##we ##h , with ba ##al as a fourth god , and perhaps sham ##ash ( the sun ) in the early period . [SEP]
[CLS] at an early stage el and ya ##h ##we ##h became fused and asher ##ah did not continue as a separate state cult , although she continued to be popular at a community level until persian times . [SEP]
[CLS] ya ##h ##we ##h , the national god of both israel and judah , seems to have originated in edo ##m and midi ##an in southern can ##aan and may have been brought to israel by the ken ##ites and midi ##ani ##tes at an early stage . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a general consensus among scholars that the first format ##ive event in the emergence of the distinctive religion described in the bible was triggered by the destruction of israel by ass ##yria in c . 72 ##2 bce . [SEP]
[CLS] refugees from the northern kingdom fled to judah , bringing with them laws and a prophet ##ic tradition of ya ##h ##we ##h . [SEP]
[CLS] this religion was subsequently adopted by the landowners of judah , who in 640 bce placed the eight - year - old josiah on the throne . [SEP]
[CLS] judah at this time was a vassal state of ass ##yria , but assyrian power collapsed in the 630 ##s , and around 62 ##2 josiah and his supporters launched a bid for independence expressed as loyalty to " ya ##h ##we ##h alone " . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the de ##uter ##ono ##mist ##s , as scholars call these jude ##an nationalists , the treaty with ya ##h ##we ##h would enable israel ' s god to preserve both the city and the king in return for the people ' s worship and obedience . [SEP]
[CLS] the destruction of jerusalem , its temple , and the david ##ic dynasty by babylon in 58 ##7 / 58 ##6 bce was deeply traumatic and led to revisions of the national myth ##os during the babylonian exile . [SEP]
[CLS] this revision was expressed in the de ##uter ##ono ##mist ##ic history , the books of joshua . [SEP]
[CLS] judges , samuel and kings , which interpreted the babylonian destruction as divine ##ly - ordained punishment for the failure of israel ' s kings to worship ya ##h ##we ##h to the exclusion of all other deities . [SEP]
[CLS] the second temple period ( 520 bce 70 ce ) differed in significant ways from what had gone before . [SEP]
[CLS] strict mono ##the ##ism emerged among the priests of the temple establishment during the seventh and sixth centuries bce , as did beliefs regarding angels and demons . [SEP]
[CLS] at this time , ci ##rc ##um ##cision , dietary laws , and sabbath - ob ##ser ##vance gained more significance as symbols of jewish identity , and the institution of the synagogue became increasingly important , and most of the biblical literature , including the torah , was written or substantially revised during this time .
