[CLS] the main problem of bow ##ell ' s tenure as prime minister was the manitoba schools question . [SEP]
[CLS] his attempts at compromise alien ##ated members of his own party , and following a cabinet revolt in early 1896 he was forced to resign in favour of charles tu ##pper . [SEP]
[CLS] bow ##ell stayed on as a senator until his death at the age of 93 , but never again held ministerial office ; he served continuously as a canadian parliament ##arian for 50 years . [SEP]

[CLS] bow ##ell thus became the second of just two canadian prime ministers ( after john abbott ) to hold that office while serving in the senate rather than the house of commons . [SEP]
[CLS] as prime minister , bow ##ell faced the manitoba schools question . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1890 manitoba had abolished public funding for denomination ##al schools , both catholic and protestant , which many thought was contrary to the provisions made for denomination ##al schools in the manitoba act of 1870 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in a court challenge , the judicial committee of the privy council held that manitoba ' s abolition of public funding for denomination ##al schools was consistent with the manitoba act provision . [SEP]
[CLS] in a second court case , the judicial committee held that the federal parliament had the authority to en ##act re ##media ##l legislation to force manitoba to re - establish the funding . [SEP]
[CLS] bow ##ell and his predecessors struggled to solve this problem , which divided the country , the government , and even bow ##ell ' s own cabinet . [SEP]
[CLS] he was further hampered in his handling of the issue by his own ind ##ec ##isi ##ven ##ess on it and by his inability , as a senator , to take part in debates in the house of commons . [SEP]
[CLS] bow ##ell backed legislation , already drafted , that would have forced manitoba to restore its catholic schools , but then postponed it due to opposition within his cabinet . [SEP]
[CLS] with the ordinary business of government at a stands ##till , bow ##ell ' s cabinet decided that he was inc ##omp ##ete ##nt to lead and so , to force him to step down , seven ministers resigned and then foil ##ed the appointment of successors . [SEP]
[CLS] though bow ##ell denounced the rebellious ministers as " a nest of traitor ##s , " he had to agree to resign . [SEP]
[CLS] after ten days , following an intervention on bow ##ell ' s behalf by the governor general , the government crisis was resolved and matters seemingly returned to normal when six of the ministers were reinstated , but leadership was then effectively held by charles tu ##pper , who had joined cabinet at the same time , filling the seventh place . [SEP]
[CLS] tu ##pper , who had been canadian high commissioner to the united kingdom , had been recalled by the plot ##ters to replace bow ##ell . [SEP]
[CLS] bow ##ell formally resigned in favour of tu ##pper at the end of the parliamentary session . [SEP]
[CLS] bow ##ell stayed in the senate , serving as his party ' s leader there until 1906 , and afterward as a regular senator until his death in 1917 , having served continuously for more than 50 years as a federal parliament ##arian . [SEP]
[CLS] he died of pneumonia in belle ##ville , seventeen days short of his 94 ##th birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] he was buried in the belle ##ville cemetery . [SEP]
[CLS] his funeral was attended by a full complement of the orange order , but not by any currently or formerly elected member of the government . [SEP]
[CLS] bow ##ell was designated a national historic person in 1945 , on the advice of the national historic sites and monuments board . [SEP]
[CLS] the post office department honored bow ##ell with a commemorative stamp in 1954 , part of a series on prime ministers . [SEP]
[CLS] in their 1998 study of the canadian prime ministers up through jean ch ##ret ##ien , j . l . gran ##ats ##tein and norman hill ##mer found that a survey of canadian historians ranked bow ##ell # 19 out of the 20 prime ministers up until then . [SEP]
[CLS] until 2017 , bow ##ell remained the only canadian prime minister without a full - length biography of his life and career . [SEP]
[CLS] this short ##fall was solved when the belle ##ville historian betsy dew ##ar boy ##ce ' s book " the accidental prime minister " was published by bancroft , ontario publisher kirby books . [SEP]
[CLS] the book was published on the centennial of bow ##ell ' s death . [SEP]
[CLS] boy ##ce had died in 2007 , having unsuccessfully sought a publisher for her work for a decade . [SEP]
