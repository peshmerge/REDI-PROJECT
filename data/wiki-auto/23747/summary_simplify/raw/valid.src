In contrast to oxide ions, the oxygen atoms in the peroxide ion have an oxidation state of âˆ’1.
The most common peroxide is hydrogen peroxide (HO), colloquially known simply as "peroxide".
It is marketed as a solution in water at various concentrations.
Since hydrogen peroxide is colorless, so are these solutions.
However, hydrogen peroxide is also biochemically produced in the human body, largely as a result of a range of oxidase enzymes.
