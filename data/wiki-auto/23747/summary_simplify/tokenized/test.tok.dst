[CLS] in contrast to oxide ions , the oxygen atoms in the per ##oxide ion have an oxidation state of âˆ’ ##1 . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common per ##oxide is hydrogen per ##oxide ( ho ) , colloquially known simply as " per ##oxide " . [SEP]
[CLS] it is marketed as a solution in water at various concentrations . [SEP]
[CLS] since hydrogen per ##oxide is color ##less , so are these solutions . [SEP]
[CLS] however , hydrogen per ##oxide is also bio ##chemical ##ly produced in the human body , largely as a result of a range of ox ##ida ##se enzymes . [SEP]
