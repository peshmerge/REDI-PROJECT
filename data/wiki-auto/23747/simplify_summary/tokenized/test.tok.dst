[CLS] per ##oxide ##s are a group of compounds with the structure r ##− ##o ##− ##o ##− ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] the o ##− ##o group in a per ##oxide is called the per ##oxide group or per ##ox ##o group . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast to oxide ions , the oxygen atoms in the per ##oxide ion have an oxidation state of − ##1 . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common per ##oxide is hydrogen per ##oxide ( ho ) , colloquially known simply as " per ##oxide " . [SEP]
[CLS] it is marketed as a solution in water at various concentrations . [SEP]
[CLS] since hydrogen per ##oxide is color ##less , so are these solutions . [SEP]
[CLS] it is mainly used as an ox ##ida ##nt and b ##lea ##ching agent . [SEP]
[CLS] however , hydrogen per ##oxide is also bio ##chemical ##ly produced in the human body , largely as a result of a range of ox ##ida ##se enzymes . [SEP]
[CLS] concentrated solutions are potentially dangerous when in contact with organic compounds . [SEP]
