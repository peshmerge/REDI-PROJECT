[CLS] the ga ##uss , symbol g , sometimes gs , is the c ##gs unit of measurement of magnetic flux density ( or " magnetic induction " ) ( b ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it was named after german mathematician and physicist carl friedrich ga ##uss in 1936 . [SEP]
[CLS] one ga ##uss is defined as one maxwell per square cent ##imeter . [SEP]
[CLS] the c ##gs system has been superseded by the international system of units ( si ) , which uses the tesla ( symbol t ) as the unit of magnetic flux density . [SEP]
[CLS] one ga ##uss equals 1 ##× ##10 tesla ( 100 μ ##t ) , so 1 tesla = 10 , 000 ga ##uss . [SEP]
[CLS] as with all units whose names are derived from a person ' s name , the first letter of its symbol is upper ##case ( " g " ) , but when the unit is spelled out , it should be written in lower ##case ( " ga ##uss " ) , unless it begins a sentence . [SEP]
