The gauss, symbol G, sometimes Gs, is the cgs unit of measurement of magnetic flux density (or "magnetic induction") (B).
One gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimeter.
The cgs system has been superseded by the International System of Units (SI), which uses the tesla (symbol T) as the unit of magnetic flux density.
As with all units whose names are derived from a person's name, the first letter of its symbol is uppercase ("G"), but when the unit is spelled out, it should be written in lowercase ("gauss"), unless it begins a sentence.
