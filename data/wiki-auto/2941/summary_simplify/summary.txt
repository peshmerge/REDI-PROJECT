In Alaska, the bush typically refers to any region of the state not connected to the North American road network or ready access to the state's ferry system.
Geographically, the bush comprises the Alaska North Slope; Northwest Arctic; West, including the Baldwin and Seward Peninsulas; the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta; Southwest Alaska; Bristol Bay; Alaska Peninsula; and remote areas of the Alaska Panhandle and Interior.
Some of the larger, hub communities in the bush, which typically can be reached by larger, commercial airplanes, include Bethel, Dillingham, King Salmon, Nome, Utqiagvik, Kodiak Island, Kotzebue, and Unalaska-Dutch Harbor.
Travel between smaller communities or to and from hub communities is typically accomplished by snow machines, boats, or ATVs.
