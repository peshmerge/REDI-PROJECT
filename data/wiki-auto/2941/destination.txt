The Bush is a term for the portions of Alaska that are not connected to North America's road network.
Most of Alaska's native populations live in the Bush.
They live off the land as their ancestors did.
Places in the Bush include Bethel, Dillingham, King Salmon, Nome, Barrow, Katmai National Park, Kodiak Island, Kotzebue, and Unalaska-Dutch Harbor.
Most parts of Alaska that are off the road system can only be reached by small airplane.
Travel from place to place is usually by snowmobile or snow machine, boat, or sometimes dog sled.
