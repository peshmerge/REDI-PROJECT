[CLS] john bun ##yan ( ; baptised november 30 , 1628 ##au ##gus ##t 31 , 1688 ) was an english writer and pu ##ritan preacher best remembered as the author of the christian all ##ego ##ry " the pilgrim ' s progress " . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to " the pilgrim ' s progress " , bun ##yan wrote nearly sixty titles , many of them expanded sermons . [SEP]
[CLS] bun ##yan came from the village of el ##sto ##w , near bedford . [SEP]
[CLS] he had some schooling and at the age of sixteen joined the parliamentary army during the first stage of the english civil war . [SEP]
[CLS] after three years in the army he returned to el ##sto ##w and took up the trade of tin ##ker , which he had learned from his father . [SEP]
[CLS] he became interested in religion after his marriage , attending first the parish church and then joining the bedford meeting , a non ##con ##form ##ist group in bedford , and becoming a preacher . [SEP]
[CLS] after the restoration of the monarch , when the freedom of non ##con ##form ##ists was curt ##ailed , bun ##yan was arrested and spent the next twelve years in jail as he refused to give up preaching . [SEP]
[CLS] during this time he wrote a spiritual autobiography , " grace ab ##ound ##ing to the chief of sinn ##ers " , and began work on his most famous book , " the pilgrim ' s progress " , which was not published until some years after his release . [SEP]
[CLS] bun ##yan ' s later years , in spite of another shorter term of imprisonment , were spent in relative comfort as a popular author and preacher , and pastor of the bedford meeting . [SEP]
[CLS] he died aged 59 after falling ill on a journey to london and is buried in bun ##hill fields . [SEP]
[CLS] " the pilgrim ' s progress " became one of the most published books in the english language ; 1 , 300 editions having been printed by 1938 , 250 years after the author ' s death . [SEP]
[CLS] he is remembered in the church of england with a lesser festival on 30 august , and on the liturgical calendar of the united states episcopal church on 29 august . [SEP]
[CLS] some other churches of the anglican communion , such as the anglican church of australia , honour him on the day of his death ( 31 august ) . [SEP]
[CLS] john bun ##yan was born in 1628 to thomas and margaret bun ##yan at bun ##yan ' s end in the parish of el ##sto ##w , bedfordshire . [SEP]
[CLS] bun ##yan ' s end is about halfway between the hamlet of harrow ##den ( one mile south - east of bedford ) and el ##sto ##w high street . [SEP]
[CLS] bun ##yan ' s date of birth is not known , but he was baptised on 30 november 1628 , the baptism ##al entry in the parish register reading " john the son ##ne of thomas bun ##nio ##n jun . , the 30 november " . [SEP]
[CLS] the name bun ##yan was sp ##elt in many ways ( there are 34 variants in bedfordshire record office ) and had its origins in the norman - french name bu ##ignon . [SEP]
[CLS] there had been bun ##yan ##s in north bedfordshire since at least 119 ##9 . [SEP]
[CLS] bun ##yan ' s father was a bra ##zier or tin ##ker who travelled around the area men ##ding pots and pan ##s , and his grandfather had been a chapman or small trader . [SEP]
[CLS] the bun ##yan ##s also owned land in el ##sto ##w , so bun ##yan ' s origins were not quite as humble as he suggested in his autobiographical work " grace ab ##ound ##ing to the chief of sinn ##ers " when he wrote that his father ' s house was " of that rank that is mean ##est and most despised in the country " . [SEP]
[CLS] as a child bun ##yan learned his father ' s trade of tin ##ker and was given some ru ##diment ##ary schooling . [SEP]
[CLS] in " grace ab ##ound ##ing " bun ##yan recorded few details of his upbringing , but he did note how he picked up the habit of swearing ( from his father ) , suffered from nightmares , and read the popular stories of the day in cheap cha ##p - books . [SEP]
[CLS] in the summer of 1644 bun ##yan lost both his mother and his sister margaret . [SEP]
[CLS] that autumn , shortly before or after his sixteenth birthday , bun ##yan enlisted in the parliamentary army when an edict demanded 225 recruits from the town of bedford . [SEP]
[CLS] there are few details available about his military service , which took place during the first stage of the english civil war . [SEP]
[CLS] a muster roll for the garrison of newport pa ##gne ##ll shows him as private " john bun ##nian " . [SEP]
[CLS] when i was a soul ##dier , i , with others , were drawn out to go to such a place to be ##sie ##ge it ; but when i was just ready to go , one of the company desired to go in my room , to which , when i had consent ##ed , he took my place ; and coming to the siege , as he stood sentinel , he was shot into the head with a mu ##ske ##t bullet and died . [SEP]
[CLS] bun ##yan ' s army service provided him with a knowledge of military language which he then used in his book " the holy war " , and also exposed him to the ideas of the various religious sect ##s and radical groups he came across in newport pa ##gne ##ll . [SEP]
[CLS] the garrison town also gave him opportunities to ind ##ul ##ge in the sort of behaviour he would later confess to in " grace ab ##ound ##ing " : " so that until i came to the state of marriage , i was the very ring ##leader of all the youth that kept me company , in all manner of vice and un ##go ##dl ##iness " . [SEP]
[CLS] bun ##yan spent nearly three years in the army , leaving in 164 ##7 to return to el ##sto ##w and his trade as a tin ##ker . [SEP]
[CLS] his father had remarried and had more children and bun ##yan moved from bun ##yan ' s end to a cottage in el ##sto ##w high street . [SEP]
[CLS] within two years of leaving the army , bun ##yan married . [SEP]
[CLS] the name of his wife and the exact date of his marriage are not known , but bun ##yan did recall that his wife , a pious young woman , brought with her into the marriage two books that she had inherited from her father : arthur dent ' s " plain man ' s pathway to heaven " and lewis bay ##ly ' s " practice of pie ##ty " . [SEP]
[CLS] he also recalled that , apart from these two books , the newly - wed ##s possessed little : " not having so much household - stuff as a dish or a spoon bet ##wi ##xt us both " . [SEP]
[CLS] the couple ' s first daughter , mary , was born in 1650 , and it soon became apparent that she was blind . [SEP]
[CLS] they would have three more children , elizabeth , thomas and john . [SEP]
[CLS] by his own account , bun ##yan had as a youth enjoyed bell - ringing , dancing and playing games including on sunday , which was forbidden by the pu ##ritan ##s , who held a particularly high view of sunday , called the lord ' s day . [SEP]
[CLS] one sunday the vicar of el ##sto ##w preached a sermon against sabbath breaking , and bun ##yan took this sermon to heart . [SEP]
[CLS] that afternoon , as he was playing tip - cat ( a game in which a small piece of wood is hit with a bat ) on el ##sto ##w village green , he heard a voice from the heavens " wil ##t thou leave thy sins , and go to heaven ? [SEP]
[CLS] or have thy sins , and go to hell ? " [SEP]
[CLS] the next few years were a time of intense spiritual conflict for bun ##yan as he struggled with his doubts and fears over religion and guilt over what he saw as his state of sin . [SEP]
[CLS] during this time bun ##yan , whilst on his travels as a tin ##ker , happened to be in bedford and pass a group of women who were talking about spiritual matters on their doorstep . [SEP]
[CLS] the women were in fact some of the founding members of the bedford free church or meeting and bun ##yan , who had been attending the parish church of el ##sto ##w , was so impressed by their talk that he joined their church . [SEP]
[CLS] at that time the non ##con ##form ##ist group was meeting in st john ' s church in bedford under the leadership of former royalist army officer john gifford . [SEP]
[CLS] at the ins ##ti ##gation of other members of the congregation bun ##yan began to preach , both in the church and to groups of people in the surrounding countryside . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1656 , having by this time moved his family to st cuthbert ' s street in bedford , he published his first book , " gospel truths opened " , which was inspired by a dispute with ran ##ters and quakers . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1658 bun ##yan ' s wife died , leaving him with four small children , one of them blind . [SEP]
[CLS] a year later he married an eighteen - year - old woman named elizabeth . [SEP]
[CLS] the religious tolerance which had allowed bun ##yan the freedom to preach became curt ##ailed with the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 . [SEP]
[CLS] the members of the bedford meeting were no longer able to meet in st john ' s church , which they had been sharing with the anglican congregation . [SEP]
[CLS] that november , bun ##yan was preaching at lower sam ##sell , a farm near the village of ha ##rling ##ton , thirteen miles from bedford , when he was warned that a warrant was out for his arrest . [SEP]
[CLS] deciding not to make an escape , he was arrested and brought before the local magistrate sir francis wing ##ate , at ha ##rling ##ton house . [SEP]
[CLS] the act of uniform ##ity , which made it compulsory for preacher ##s to be ordained by an anglican bishop and for the revised book of common prayer to be used in church services , was still two years away , and the act of convent ##icles , which made it illegal to hold religious meetings of five or more people outside the church of england was not passed until 1664 . [SEP]
[CLS] bun ##yan was arrested under the convent ##icle act of 159 ##3 , which made it an offence to attend a religious gathering other than at the parish church with more than five people outside their family . [SEP]
[CLS] the offence was punish ##able by 3 months imprisonment followed by ban ##ishment or execution if the person then failed to promise not to re - off ##end . [SEP]
[CLS] the act had been little used , and bun ##yan ' s arrest was probably due in part to concerns that non - conform ##ist religious meetings were being held as a cover for people plotting against the king ( although this was not the case with bun ##yan ' s meetings ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the trial of bun ##yan took place in january 1661 at the quarter sessions in bedford , before a group of magistrates under john ke ##lyn ##ge , who would later help to draw up the act of uniform ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] bun ##yan , who had been held in prison since his arrest , was indicted of having " devil ##ishly and per ##nic ##ious ##y abs ##tained from coming to church to hear divine service " and having held " several unlawful meetings and convent ##icles , to the great disturbance and distraction of the good subjects of this kingdom " . [SEP]
[CLS] he was sentenced to three months imprisonment with transportation to follow if at the end of this time he didn ' t agree to attend the parish church and des ##ist from preaching . [SEP]
[CLS] as bun ##yan refused to agree to give up preaching , his period of imprisonment eventually extended to 12 years and brought great hardship to his family . [SEP]
[CLS] elizabeth , who made st ##ren ##uous attempts to obtain his release , had been pregnant when her husband was arrested and she subsequently gave birth prematurely to a still - born child . [SEP]
[CLS] left to bring up four step - children , one of whom was blind , she had to rely on the charity of bun ##yan ' s fellow members of the bedford meeting and other supporters and on what little her husband could earn in gao ##l by making shoe ##lace ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] but bun ##yan remained res ##ol ##ute : " o i saw in this condition i was a man who was pulling down his house upon the head of his wife and children ; yet thought i , i must do it , i must do it " . [SEP]
[CLS] bun ##yan spent his 12 years ' imprisonment in bedford county gao ##l , which stood on the corner of the high street and silver street . [SEP]
[CLS] there were however occasions when he was allowed out of prison , depending on the gao ##lers and the mood of the authorities at the time , and he was able to attend the bedford meeting and even preach . [SEP]
[CLS] his daughter sarah was born during his imprisonment ( the other child of his second marriage , joseph , was born after his release in 1672 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in prison , bun ##yan had a copy of the bible and of john fox ##e ' s " book of martyrs " , as well as writing materials . [SEP]
[CLS] he also had at times the company of other preacher ##s who had been imprisoned . [SEP]
[CLS] it was in bedford gao ##l that he wrote " grace ab ##ound ##ing " and started work on " the pilgrim ' s progress " , as well as penn ##ing several tracts that may have brought him a little money . [SEP]
[CLS] in 167 ##1 , while still in prison , he was chosen as pastor of the bedford meeting . [SEP]
[CLS] by that time there was a mood of increasing religious to ##ler ##ation in the country and in march 1672 the king issued a declaration of ind ##ul ##gence which suspended penal laws against non ##con ##form ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] thousands of non ##con ##form ##ists were released from prison , amongst them bun ##yan and five of his fellow inmates of bedford gao ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] bun ##yan was freed in may 1672 and immediately obtained a licence to preach under the declaration of ind ##ul ##gence . [SEP]
[CLS] following his release from gao ##l in 1672 bun ##yan probably did not return to his former occupation of tin ##ker . [SEP]
[CLS] instead he devoted his time to writing and preaching . [SEP]
[CLS] he continued as pastor of the bedford meeting and travelled over bedfordshire and adjoining counties on horseback to preach , becoming known affectionately as " bishop bun ##yan " . [SEP]
[CLS] his preaching also took him to london , where lord mayor sir john shorter became a friend and presented him with a silver - mounted walking stick . [SEP]
[CLS] " the pilgrim ' s progress " was published in 167 ##8 by nathaniel ponder and immediately became popular , though probably making more money for its publisher than for its author . [SEP]
[CLS] two events marred bun ##yan ' s life during the later 1670 ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] firstly he became em ##bro ##iled in a scandal concerning a young woman called agnes beaumont . [SEP]
[CLS] when going to preach in ga ##ml ##inga ##y in 167 ##4 he allowed beaumont , a member of the bedford meeting , to ride pill ##ion on his horse , much to the anger of her father , who then died suddenly . [SEP]
[CLS] his daughter was initially suspected of poisoning him , though the coroner found he had died of natural causes . [SEP]
[CLS] and then in 167 ##6 - 7 he underwent a second term of imprisonment , probably for refusing to attend the parish church . [SEP]
[CLS] this second imprisonment lasted six months . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1688 , on his way to london , bun ##yan made a det ##our to reading , berkshire , to try and resolve a quarrel between a father and son . [SEP]
[CLS] continuing to london to the house of his friend , gr ##oc ##er john st ##rud ##wick of snow hill in the city of london , he was caught in a storm and fell ill with a fever . [SEP]
[CLS] he died in st ##rud ##wick ' s house on the morning of 31 august 1688 and was buried in the tomb belonging to st ##rud ##wick in bun ##hill fields non ##con ##form ##ist burial ground in london . [SEP]
[CLS] bun ##yan ' s estate at his death was worth £ ##42 19 ##s 0 ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] his widow elizabeth died in 169 ##1 . [SEP]
[CLS] between 1656 , when he published his first work , " some gospel truths opened " ( a tract against the ran ##ters and quakers — has — who at the time were somewhat ind ##ist ##ing ##uis ##hab ##le ) , and his death in 1688 , bun ##yan published 42 titles . [SEP]
[CLS] a further two works , including his last sermon , were published the following year by george larkin . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1692 south ##wark comb - maker charles doe , who was a friend of bun ##yan ' s later years , brought out , with the collaboration of bun ##yan ' s widow , a collection of the author ' s works , including 12 previously unpublished titles , mostly sermons . [SEP]
[CLS] six years later doe published " the heavenly foot ##man " and finally in 1765 " relation of my imprisonment " was published , giving a total of 58 published titles . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the all ##ego ##ry " the pilgrim ' s progress " , written during bun ##yan ' s twelve - year imprisonment although not published until 167 ##8 six years after his release , that made bun ##yan ' s name as an author with its immediate success . [SEP]
[CLS] it remains the book for which bun ##yan is best remembered . [SEP]
[CLS] the images bun ##yan uses in " the pilgrim ' s progress " are reflections of images from his own world ; the strait gate is a version of the wicket gate at el ##sto ##w abbey church , the sl ##ough of des ##pon ##d is a reflection of sq ##uit ##ch fen , a wet and moss ##y area near his cottage in harrow ##den , the del ##ect ##able mountains are an image of the chi ##lter ##n hills surrounding bedfordshire . [SEP]
[CLS] even his characters , like the evangelist as influenced by john gifford , are reflections of real people . [SEP]
[CLS] further all ##egorical works were to follow : " the life and death of mr . bad ##man " ( 1680 ) , " pilgrim ' s progress part ii " and " the holy war " ( 1682 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] " grace ab ##ound ##ing to the chief of sinn ##ers " , a spiritual autobiography , was published in 1666 , when he was still in jail . [SEP]

[CLS] there is another statue of him in kings ##way , london , and there are memorial windows in westminster abbey , south ##wark cathedral and various churches , including el ##sto ##w abbey ( the parish church of el ##sto ##w ) and the bun ##yan meeting free church in bedford . [SEP]
