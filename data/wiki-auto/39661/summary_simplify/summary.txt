John Bunyan ( ; baptised November 30, 1628August 31, 1688) was an English writer and Puritan preacher best remembered as the author of the Christian allegory "The Pilgrim's Progress".
He had some schooling and at the age of sixteen joined the Parliamentary Army during the first stage of the English Civil War.
After the restoration of the monarch, when the freedom of nonconformists was curtailed, Bunyan was arrested and spent the next twelve years in jail as he refused to give up preaching.
During this time he wrote a spiritual autobiography, "Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners", and began work on his most famous book, "The Pilgrim's Progress", which was not published until some years after his release.
"The Pilgrim's Progress" became one of the most published books in the English language; 1,300 editions having been printed by 1938, 250 years after the author's death.
He is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 30 August, and on the liturgical calendar of the United States Episcopal Church on 29 August.
Bunyan's date of birth is not known, but he was baptised on 30 November 1628, the baptismal entry in the parish register reading "John the sonne of Thomas Bunnion Jun., the 30 November".
The name Bunyan was spelt in many ways (there are 34 variants in Bedfordshire Record Office) and had its origins in the Norman-French name Buignon.
Bunyan's father was a brazier or tinker who travelled around the area mending pots and pans, and his grandfather had been a chapman or small trader.
The Bunyans also owned land in Elstow, so Bunyan's origins were not quite as humble as he suggested in his autobiographical work "Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners" when he wrote that his father's house was "of that rank that is meanest and most despised in the country".
As a child Bunyan learned his father's trade of tinker and was given some rudimentary schooling.
In "Grace Abounding" Bunyan recorded few details of his upbringing, but he did note how he picked up the habit of swearing (from his father), suffered from nightmares, and read the popular stories of the day in cheap chap-books.
That autumn, shortly before or after his sixteenth birthday, Bunyan enlisted in the Parliamentary army when an edict demanded 225 recruits from the town of Bedford.
Bunyan's army service provided him with a knowledge of military language which he then used in his book "The Holy War", and also exposed him to the ideas of the various religious sects and radical groups he came across in Newport Pagnell.
The garrison town also gave him opportunities to indulge in the sort of behaviour he would later confess to in "Grace Abounding": "So that until I came to the state of Marriage, I was the very ringleader of all the Youth that kept me company, in all manner of vice and ungodliness".
Bunyan spent nearly three years in the army, leaving in 1647 to return to Elstow and his trade as a tinker.
His father had remarried and had more children and Bunyan moved from Bunyan's End to a cottage in Elstow High Street.
Within two years of leaving the army, Bunyan married.
The name of his wife and the exact date of his marriage are not known, but Bunyan did recall that his wife, a pious young woman, brought with her into the marriage two books that she had inherited from her father: Arthur Dent's "Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven" and Lewis Bayly's "Practice of Piety".
The couple's first daughter, Mary, was born in 1650, and it soon became apparent that she was blind.
One Sunday the vicar of Elstow preached a sermon against Sabbath breaking, and Bunyan took this sermon to heart.
The next few years were a time of intense spiritual conflict for Bunyan as he struggled with his doubts and fears over religion and guilt over what he saw as his state of sin.
During this time Bunyan, whilst on his travels as a tinker, happened to be in Bedford and pass a group of women who were talking about spiritual matters on their doorstep.
The women were in fact some of the founding members of the Bedford Free Church or Meeting and Bunyan, who had been attending the parish church of Elstow, was so impressed by their talk that he joined their church.
At the instigation of other members of the congregation Bunyan began to preach, both in the church and to groups of people in the surrounding countryside.
In 1656, having by this time moved his family to St Cuthbert's Street in Bedford, he published his first book, "Gospel Truths Opened", which was inspired by a dispute with Ranters and Quakers.
The members of the Bedford Meeting were no longer able to meet in St John's church, which they had been sharing with the Anglican congregation.
That November, Bunyan was preaching at Lower Samsell, a farm near the village of Harlington, thirteen miles from Bedford, when he was warned that a warrant was out for his arrest.
Deciding not to make an escape, he was arrested and brought before the local magistrate Sir Francis Wingate, at Harlington House.
The Act of Uniformity, which made it compulsory for preachers to be ordained by an Anglican bishop and for the revised Book of Common Prayer to be used in church services, was still two years away, and the Act of Conventicles, which made it illegal to hold religious meetings of five or more people outside the Church of England was not passed until 1664.
Bunyan was arrested under the Conventicle Act of 1593, which made it an offence to attend a religious gathering other than at the parish church with more than five people outside their family.
The offence was punishable by 3 months imprisonment followed by banishment or execution if the person then failed to promise not to re-offend.
The Act had been little used, and Bunyan's arrest was probably due in part to concerns that non-conformist religious meetings were being held as a cover for people plotting against the king (although this was not the case with Bunyan's meetings).
The trial of Bunyan took place in January 1661 at the quarter sessions in Bedford, before a group of magistrates under John Kelynge, who would later help to draw up the Act of Uniformity.
Bunyan, who had been held in prison since his arrest, was indicted of having "devilishly and perniciousy abstained from coming to church to hear divine service" and having held "several unlawful meetings and conventicles, to the great disturbance and distraction of the good subjects of this kingdom".
He was sentenced to three months imprisonment with transportation to follow if at the end of this time he didn't agree to attend the parish church and desist from preaching.
As Bunyan refused to agree to give up preaching, his period of imprisonment eventually extended to 12 years and brought great hardship to his family.
Elizabeth, who made strenuous attempts to obtain his release, had been pregnant when her husband was arrested and she subsequently gave birth prematurely to a still-born child.
Left to bring up four step-children, one of whom was blind, she had to rely on the charity of Bunyan's fellow members of the Bedford Meeting and other supporters and on what little her husband could earn in gaol by making shoelaces.
Bunyan spent his 12 years' imprisonment in Bedford County Gaol, which stood on the corner of the High Street and Silver Street.
There were however occasions when he was allowed out of prison, depending on the gaolers and the mood of the authorities at the time, and he was able to attend the Bedford Meeting and even preach.
His daughter Sarah was born during his imprisonment (the other child of his second marriage, Joseph, was born after his release in 1672).
It was in Bedford Gaol that he wrote "Grace Abounding" and started work on "The Pilgrim's Progress", as well as penning several tracts that may have brought him a little money.
In 1671, while still in prison, he was chosen as pastor of the Bedford Meeting.
By that time there was a mood of increasing religious toleration in the country and in March 1672 the king issued a declaration of indulgence which suspended penal laws against nonconformists.
He continued as pastor of the Bedford Meeting and travelled over Bedfordshire and adjoining counties on horseback to preach, becoming known affectionately as "Bishop Bunyan".
His preaching also took him to London, where Lord Mayor Sir John Shorter became a friend and presented him with a silver-mounted walking stick.
When going to preach in Gamlingay in 1674 he allowed Beaumont, a member of the Bedford Meeting, to ride pillion on his horse, much to the anger of her father, who then died suddenly.
And then in 1676-7 he underwent a second term of imprisonment, probably for refusing to attend the parish church.
In 1688, on his way to London, Bunyan made a detour to Reading, Berkshire, to try and resolve a quarrel between a father and son.
Between 1656, when he published his first work, "Some Gospel Truths Opened" (a tract against the Ranters and Quakers—has—who at the time were somewhat indistinguishable), and his death in 1688, Bunyan published 42 titles.
It is the allegory "The Pilgrim's Progress", written during Bunyan's twelve-year imprisonment although not published until 1678 six years after his release, that made Bunyan's name as an author with its immediate success.
The images Bunyan uses in "The Pilgrim's Progress" are reflections of images from his own world; the strait gate is a version of the wicket gate at Elstow Abbey church, the Slough of Despond is a reflection of Squitch Fen, a wet and mossy area near his cottage in Harrowden, the Delectable Mountains are an image of the Chiltern Hills surrounding Bedfordshire.
In 1874, a bronze statue of John Bunyan, sculpted by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm, was erected in Bedford.
There are three scenes from "The Pilgrim's Progress" on the stone plinth: Christian at the wicket gate; his fight with Apollyon; and losing his burden at the foot of the cross of Jesus.
In 1876 the Duke of Bedford gave bronze doors by Frederick Thrupp depicting scenes from "The Pilgrim's Progress" to the John Bunyan Meeting (the former Bedford Meeting which had been renamed in Bunyan's honour, and now houses the John Bunyan Museum).
There is another statue of him in Kingsway, London, and there are memorial windows in Westminster Abbey, Southwark Cathedral and various churches, including Elstow Abbey (the parish church of Elstow) and the Bunyan Meeting Free Church in Bedford.
Bunyan is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 30 August, and on the liturgical calendar of the United States Episcopal Church on 29 August.
By 1692, four years after the author's death, publisher Charles Doe estimated that 100,000 copies had been printed in England, as well as editions "in France, Holland, New England and Welch".
Although popular interest in Bunyan waned during the second half of the twentieth century, academic interest in the writer has increased and Oxford University Press brought out a new edition of his works, beginning in 1976.
An opera by Ralph Vaughan Williams based on "The Pilgrim's Progress" was first performed at the Royal Opera House in 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain and revived in 2012 by the English National Opera.
Moot Hall Museum (in Elstow) has a record of John's descendants, down to the nineteenth century but as of September 2013, no verifiable trace of later descendants has been found.
The best collection of Bunyan's writing appears in "The Works of John Bunyan," edited by George Offor and published in London in three volumes between 1853 and 1855, containing 61 unique works.
The misnamed "Complete Works of John Bunyan," edited by John Gulliver and published in one volume by Bradley, Garretson & Co. in 1871, omits 28 works and lacks the biblical references and editorial footnotes present in Offor's collection.
