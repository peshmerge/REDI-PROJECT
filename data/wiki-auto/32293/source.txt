The secretary of state is a senior official of the federal government of the United States of America, and as head of the United States Department of State, is principally concerned with foreign policy and is considered to be the U.S. government's minister of foreign affairs.
The secretary of state is nominated by the president of the United States and, following a confirmation hearing before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, is confirmed by the United States Senate.
The secretary of state, along with the secretary of the treasury, secretary of defense, and attorney general, are generally regarded as the four most important Cabinet members because of the importance of their respective departments.
Secretary of state is a Level I position in the Executive Schedule and thus earns the salary prescribed for that level (currently US$210,700).
The current secretary of state is Mike Pompeo, who previously served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
Pompeo replaced Rex Tillerson whom President Trump dismissed on March 13, 2018.
Tillerson's last day at the State Department was March 31, 2018.
Pompeo was confirmed by the Senate on April 26, 2018 and was sworn in later that day.
Most of the domestic functions of the Department of State have been transferred to other agencies.
Those that remain include storage and use of the Great Seal of the United States, performance of protocol functions for the White House, and the drafting of certain proclamations.
The secretary also negotiates with the individual States over the extradition of fugitives to foreign countries.
Under Federal Law, the resignation of a president or of a vice president is only valid if declared in writing, in an instrument delivered to the office of the secretary of state.
Accordingly, the resignations in disgrace of President Richard Nixon and of Vice President Spiro Agnew were formalized in instruments delivered to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
As the highest-ranking member of the cabinet, the secretary of state is the third-highest official of the executive branch of the federal government of the United States, after the president and vice president, and is fourth in line to succeed the presidency, coming after the vice president, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and the president pro tempore of the Senate.
Six secretaries of state have gone on to be elected president.
Others, including Henry Clay, William Seward, James Blaine, William Jennings Bryan, John Kerry, and Hillary Clinton have been unsuccessful presidential candidates, either before or after their term of office as Secretary of State.
The nature of the position means that secretaries of state engage in travel around the world.
The record for most countries visited in a secretary's tenure is 112 by Hillary Clinton.
Second is Madeleine Albright with 96.
The record for most air miles traveled in a secretary's tenure is 1,417,576 miles by John Kerry.
Second is Condoleezza Rice's 1,059,247 miles, and third is Clinton's 956,733 miles.
