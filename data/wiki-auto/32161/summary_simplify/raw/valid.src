When it affects the lower urinary tract it is known as a bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as a kidney infection (pyelonephritis).
Symptoms from a lower urinary tract infection include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder.
In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.
Although sexual intercourse is a risk factor, UTIs are not classified as sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
In those with vague symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection.
In uncomplicated cases, UTIs are treated with a short course of antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.
In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous antibiotics may be needed.
If symptoms do not improve in two or three days, further diagnostic testing may be needed.
In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during pregnancy is an exception.
In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a preventative measure.
In women, they are the most common form of bacterial infection.
Up to 10% of women have a urinary tract infection in a given year, and half of women have at least one infection at some point in their lifetime.
Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers Papyrus dated to c. 1550 BC.
People experiencing an upper urinary tract infection, or pyelonephritis, may experience flank pain, fever, or nausea and vomiting in addition to the classic symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection.
Rarely, the urine may appear bloody or contain visible pus in the urine.
In young children, the only symptom of a urinary tract infection (UTI) may be a fever.
Because of the lack of more obvious symptoms, when females under the age of two or uncircumcised males less than a year exhibit a fever, a culture of the urine is recommended by many medical associations.
The presentations may be vague with incontinence, a change in mental status, or fatigue as the only symptoms, while some present to a health care provider with sepsis, an infection of the blood, as the first symptoms.
It is reasonable to obtain a urine culture in those with signs of systemic infection that may be unable to report urinary symptoms, such as when advanced dementia is present.
Systemic signs of infection include a fever or increase in temperature of more than 1.1 C-change from usual, chills, and an increased white blood cell count.
Rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections.
These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than urinary tract infection.
In young sexually active women, sexual activity is the cause of 75–90% of bladder infections, with the risk of infection related to the frequency of sex.
The term "honeymoon cystitis" has been applied to this phenomenon of frequent UTIs during early marriage.
Condom use without spermicide or use of birth control pills does not increase the risk of uncomplicated urinary tract infection.
Women are more prone to UTIs than men because, in females, the urethra is much shorter and closer to the anus.
As a woman's estrogen levels decrease with menopause, her risk of urinary tract infections increases due to the loss of protective vaginal flora.
Additionally, vaginal atrophy that can sometimes occur after menopause is associated with recurrent urinary tract infections.
While bacteria is commonly present in the urine of older males this does not appear to affect the risk of urinary tract infections.
The risk of bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) is between three and six percent per day and prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing symptomatic infections.
The risk of an associated infection can be decreased by catheterizing only when necessary, using aseptic technique for insertion, and maintaining unobstructed closed drainage of the catheter.
Male scuba divers using condom catheters and female divers using external catching devices for their dry suits are also susceptible to urinary tract infections.
Other risk factors include diabetes, being uncircumcised, and having a large prostate.
In children UTIs are associated with vesicoureteral reflux (an abnormal movement of urine from the bladder into ureters or kidneys) and constipation.
Persons with spinal cord injury are at increased risk for urinary tract infection in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of voiding dysfunction.
Additionally, use of cranberry juice or cranberry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population.
The bacteria that cause urinary tract infections typically enter the bladder via the urethra.
The increased resistance of urinary pathogens to quinolone antibiotics has been reported worldwide and might be the consequence of overuse and misuse of quinolones.
In straightforward cases, a diagnosis may be made and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation.
In complicated or questionable cases, it may be useful to confirm the diagnosis via urinalysis, looking for the presence of urinary nitrites, white blood cells (leukocytes), or leukocyte esterase.
Urine culture is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 10 colony-forming units per mL of a typical urinary tract organism.
Antibiotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures, making them useful in the selection of antibiotic treatment.
As symptoms can be vague and without reliable tests for urinary tract infections, diagnosis can be difficult in the elderly.
Alternatively, it may involve the upper urinary tract, in which case it is known as pyelonephritis.
If the urine contains significant bacteria but there are no symptoms, the condition is known as asymptomatic bacteriuria.
If a urinary tract infection involves the upper tract, and the person has diabetes mellitus, is pregnant, is male, or immunocompromised, it is considered complicated.
Otherwise if a woman is healthy and premenopausal it is considered uncomplicated.
In children when a urinary tract infection is associated with a fever, it is deemed to be an upper urinary tract infection.
To make the diagnosis of a urinary tract infection in children, a positive urinary culture is required.
Contamination poses a frequent challenge depending on the method of collection used, thus a cutoff of 10CFU/mL is used for a "clean-catch" mid stream sample, 10CFU/mL is used for catheter-obtained specimens, and 10CFU/mL is used for suprapubic aspirations (a sample drawn directly from the bladder with a needle).
The use of "urine bags" to collect samples is discouraged by the World Health Organization due to the high rate of contamination when cultured, and catheterization is preferred in those not toilet trained.
Some, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram (watching a person's urethra and urinary bladder with real time x-rays while they urinate) in all children less than two years old who have had a urinary tract infection.
However, because there is a lack of effective treatment if problems are found, others such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence only recommends routine imaging in those less than six months old or who have unusual findings.
These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection.
Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics.
Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.
Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles are present in the bladder wall.
Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.
A number of measures have not been confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers.
There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching.
In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm as a method of contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods.
Using urinary catheters as little and as short of time as possible and appropriate care of the catheter when used prevents catheter-associated urinary tract infections.
Evidence does not support a significant decrease in risk when silver-alloy catheters are used.
Methenamine is another agent used for this purpose as in the bladder where the acidity is low it produces formaldehyde to which resistance does not develop.
In cases where infections are related to intercourse, taking antibiotics afterwards may be useful.
In post-menopausal women, topical vaginal estrogen has been found to reduce recurrence.
As opposed to topical creams, the use of vaginal estrogen from pessaries has not been as useful as low dose antibiotics.
Antibiotics following short term urinary catheterization decreases the subsequent risk of a bladder infection.
However recurrent UTIs are a rare cause of further kidney problems if there are no underlying abnormalities of the kidneys, resulting in less than a third of a percent (0.33%) of chronic kidney disease in adults.
Whether routine circumcision prevents UTIs has not been well studied as of 2011.
Some research suggests that cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of UTIs in those with frequent infections.
The role of the urinary microbiome in maintaining urinary tract health is not well understood as of 2015.
Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed during the first few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection.
However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood).
If not treated it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth.
Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.
However, resistance to fluoroquinolones among the bacteria that cause urinary infections has been increasing.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends against the use of fluoroquinolones when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects.
The Infectious Diseases Society of America states this due to the concern of generating resistance to this class of medication.
For simple UTIs, children often respond to a three-day course of antibiotics.
Women with recurrent simple UTIs are over 90% accurate in identifying new infections.
Pyelonephritis is treated more aggressively than a simple bladder infection using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics.
Seven days of the oral fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used in areas where the resistance rate is less than 10%.
If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone is often prescribed.
Complications such as urinary obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment.
They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years, with 10% of women getting an infection yearly and more than 40–60% having an infection at some point in their lives.
Recurrences are common, with nearly half of people getting a second infection within a year.
They are the most common cause of hospital acquired infections accounting for approximately 40%.
Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine increase with age from two to seven percent in women of child bearing age to as high as 50% in elderly women in care homes.
Among children, urinary tract infections are most common in uncircumcised males less than three months of age, followed by females less than one year.
In the United States, urinary tract infections account for nearly seven million office visits, a million emergency department visits, and one hundred thousand hospitalizations every year.
In the United States the direct cost of treatment is estimated at 1.6billionUSD yearly.
Effective treatment did not occur until the development and availability of antibiotics in the 1930s before which time herbs, bloodletting and rest were recommended.
During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, which leads to a greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys.
While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection.
Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy.
A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures).
Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.
