[CLS] when it affects the lower ur ##ina ##ry tract it is known as a bladder infection ( cy ##sti ##tis ) and when it affects the upper ur ##ina ##ry tract it is known as a kidney infection ( p ##ye ##lone ##ph ##rit ##is ) . [SEP]
[CLS] symptoms from a lower ur ##ina ##ry tract infection include pain with ur ##ination , frequent ur ##ination , and feeling the need to ur ##inate despite having an empty bladder . [SEP]
[CLS] in the very old and the very young , symptoms may be vague or non - specific . [SEP]
[CLS] although sexual intercourse is a risk factor , ut ##is are not classified as sexually transmitted infections ( st ##is ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in those with vague symptoms , diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection . [SEP]
[CLS] in un ##com ##pl ##icated cases , ut ##is are treated with a short course of antibiotics such as ni ##tro ##fur ##anto ##in or trim ##eth ##op ##rim / sul ##fa ##met ##ho ##xa ##zo ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] in complicated cases , a longer course or intra ##ven ##ous antibiotics may be needed . [SEP]
[CLS] if symptoms do not improve in two or three days , further diagnostic testing may be needed . [SEP]
[CLS] in those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms , antibiotics are generally not needed , although during pregnancy is an exception . [SEP]
[CLS] in those with frequent infections , a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long - term antibiotics may be used as a prevent ##ative measure . [SEP]
[CLS] in women , they are the most common form of bacterial infection . [SEP]
[CLS] up to 10 % of women have a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection in a given year , and half of women have at least one infection at some point in their lifetime . [SEP]
[CLS] ur ##ina ##ry tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the e ##bers papyrus dated to c . 1550 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] people experiencing an upper ur ##ina ##ry tract infection , or p ##ye ##lone ##ph ##rit ##is , may experience flank pain , fever , or nausea and vomiting in addition to the classic symptoms of a lower ur ##ina ##ry tract infection . [SEP]
[CLS] rarely , the urine may appear bloody or contain visible pu ##s in the urine . [SEP]
[CLS] in young children , the only sy ##mpt ##om of a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection ( ut ##i ) may be a fever . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the lack of more obvious symptoms , when females under the age of two or un ##ci ##rc ##um ##cise ##d males less than a year exhibit a fever , a culture of the urine is recommended by many medical associations . [SEP]
[CLS] the presentations may be vague with inc ##ont ##inen ##ce , a change in mental status , or fatigue as the only symptoms , while some present to a health care provider with sep ##sis , an infection of the blood , as the first symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] it is reasonable to obtain a urine culture in those with signs of systemic infection that may be unable to report ur ##ina ##ry symptoms , such as when advanced dementia is present . [SEP]
[CLS] systemic signs of infection include a fever or increase in temperature of more than 1 . 1 c - change from usual , chill ##s , and an increased white blood cell count . [SEP]
[CLS] rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections . [SEP]
[CLS] these infections are usually classified as a ur ##eth ##rit ##is rather than ur ##ina ##ry tract infection . [SEP]
[CLS] in young sexually active women , sexual activity is the cause of 75 – 90 % of bladder infections , with the risk of infection related to the frequency of sex . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " honeymoon cy ##sti ##tis " has been applied to this phenomenon of frequent ut ##is during early marriage . [SEP]
[CLS] condom use without sperm ##icide or use of birth control pills does not increase the risk of un ##com ##pl ##icated ur ##ina ##ry tract infection . [SEP]
[CLS] women are more prone to ut ##is than men because , in females , the ur ##eth ##ra is much shorter and closer to the an ##us . [SEP]
[CLS] as a woman ' s est ##rogen levels decrease with men ##opa ##use , her risk of ur ##ina ##ry tract infections increases due to the loss of protective va ##ginal flora . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , va ##ginal at ##rop ##hy that can sometimes occur after men ##opa ##use is associated with rec ##urrent ur ##ina ##ry tract infections . [SEP]
[CLS] while bacteria is commonly present in the urine of older males this does not appear to affect the risk of ur ##ina ##ry tract infections . [SEP]
[CLS] the risk of ba ##cter ##iu ##ria ( bacteria in the urine ) is between three and six percent per day and prop ##hyl ##actic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic infections . [SEP]
[CLS] the risk of an associated infection can be decreased by cat ##het ##eri ##zing only when necessary , using as ##ept ##ic technique for insertion , and maintaining uno ##bs ##truct ##ed closed drainage of the cat ##het ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] male scuba divers using condom cat ##het ##ers and female divers using external catching devices for their dry suits are also susceptible to ur ##ina ##ry tract infections . [SEP]
[CLS] other risk factors include diabetes , being un ##ci ##rc ##um ##cise ##d , and having a large prostate . [SEP]
[CLS] in children ut ##is are associated with ve ##sic ##our ##eter ##al ref ##lux ( an abnormal movement of urine from the bladder into ur ##eter ##s or kidney ##s ) and con ##sti ##pati ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] persons with spinal cord injury are at increased risk for ur ##ina ##ry tract infection in part because of chronic use of cat ##het ##er , and in part because of void ##ing dysfunction . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , use of cr ##an ##berry juice or cr ##an ##berry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population . [SEP]
[CLS] the bacteria that cause ur ##ina ##ry tract infections typically enter the bladder via the ur ##eth ##ra . [SEP]
[CLS] the increased resistance of ur ##ina ##ry pathogen ##s to qui ##no ##lone antibiotics has been reported worldwide and might be the consequence of over ##use and mis ##use of qui ##no ##lone ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in straightforward cases , a diagnosis may be made and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation . [SEP]
[CLS] in complicated or questionable cases , it may be useful to confirm the diagnosis via ur ##inal ##ysis , looking for the presence of ur ##ina ##ry ni ##tri ##tes , white blood cells ( le ##uk ##ocytes ) , or le ##uk ##oc ##yte este ##rase . [SEP]
[CLS] urine culture is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 10 colony - forming units per ml of a typical ur ##ina ##ry tract organism . [SEP]
[CLS] anti ##biotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures , making them useful in the selection of anti ##biotic treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] as symptoms can be vague and without reliable tests for ur ##ina ##ry tract infections , diagnosis can be difficult in the elderly . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatively , it may involve the upper ur ##ina ##ry tract , in which case it is known as p ##ye ##lone ##ph ##rit ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] if the urine contains significant bacteria but there are no symptoms , the condition is known as as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic ba ##cter ##iu ##ria . [SEP]
[CLS] if a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection involves the upper tract , and the person has diabetes mel ##lit ##us , is pregnant , is male , or im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##rom ##ised , it is considered complicated . [SEP]
[CLS] otherwise if a woman is healthy and prem ##eno ##pa ##usa ##l it is considered un ##com ##pl ##icated . [SEP]
[CLS] in children when a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection is associated with a fever , it is deemed to be an upper ur ##ina ##ry tract infection . [SEP]
[CLS] to make the diagnosis of a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection in children , a positive ur ##ina ##ry culture is required . [SEP]
[CLS] contamination poses a frequent challenge depending on the method of collection used , thus a cut ##off of 10 ##c ##fu / ml is used for a " clean - catch " mid stream sample , 10 ##c ##fu / ml is used for cat ##het ##er - obtained specimens , and 10 ##c ##fu / ml is used for su ##pr ##ap ##ub ##ic aspirations ( a sample drawn directly from the bladder with a needle ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of " urine bags " to collect samples is discouraged by the world health organization due to the high rate of contamination when culture ##d , and cat ##het ##eri ##zation is preferred in those not toilet trained . [SEP]
[CLS] some , such as the american academy of pediatric ##s recommends renal ultrasound and void ##ing cy ##sto ##ure ##th ##ro ##gram ( watching a person ' s ur ##eth ##ra and ur ##ina ##ry bladder with real time x - rays while they ur ##inate ) in all children less than two years old who have had a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection . [SEP]
[CLS] however , because there is a lack of effective treatment if problems are found , others such as the national institute for health and care excellence only recommends routine imaging in those less than six months old or who have unusual findings . [SEP]
[CLS] these infections are typically classified as a ur ##eth ##rit ##is rather than a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection . [SEP]
[CLS] inter ##sti ##tial cy ##sti ##tis ( chronic pain in the bladder ) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of ut ##i symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics . [SEP]
[CLS] pro ##sta ##ti ##tis ( inflammation of the prostate ) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic cy ##sti ##tis is a rare condition where e ##osi ##no ##phile ##s are present in the bladder wall . [SEP]
[CLS] its cause is not entirely clear ; however , it may be linked to food all ##er ##gies , infections , and medications among others . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of measures have not been confirmed to affect ut ##i frequency including : ur ##inating immediately after intercourse , the type of underwear used , personal hygiene methods used after ur ##inating or def ##eca ##ting , or whether a person typically bath ##es or showers . [SEP]
[CLS] there is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one ' s urine , tam ##pon use , and do ##uchi ##ng . [SEP]
[CLS] in those with frequent ur ##ina ##ry tract infections who use sperm ##icide or a dia ##ph ##rag ##m as a method of contra ##ception , they are advised to use alternative methods . [SEP]
[CLS] using ur ##ina ##ry cat ##het ##ers as little and as short of time as possible and appropriate care of the cat ##het ##er when used prevents cat ##het ##er - associated ur ##ina ##ry tract infections . [SEP]
[CLS] evidence does not support a significant decrease in risk when silver - alloy cat ##het ##ers are used . [SEP]
[CLS] met ##hen ##amine is another agent used for this purpose as in the bladder where the acid ##ity is low it produces formal ##deh ##yde to which resistance does not develop . [SEP]
[CLS] in cases where infections are related to intercourse , taking antibiotics afterwards may be useful . [SEP]
[CLS] in post - men ##opa ##usa ##l women , topical va ##ginal est ##rogen has been found to reduce rec ##ur ##rence . [SEP]
[CLS] as opposed to topical cream ##s , the use of va ##ginal est ##rogen from pe ##ssar ##ies has not been as useful as low dose antibiotics . [SEP]
[CLS] antibiotics following short term ur ##ina ##ry cat ##het ##eri ##zation decreases the subsequent risk of a bladder infection . [SEP]
[CLS] however rec ##urrent ut ##is are a rare cause of further kidney problems if there are no underlying abnormalities of the kidney ##s , resulting in less than a third of a percent ( 0 . 33 % ) of chronic kidney disease in adults . [SEP]
[CLS] whether routine ci ##rc ##um ##cision prevents ut ##is has not been well studied as of 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] some research suggests that cr ##an ##berry ( juice or capsule ##s ) may decrease the number of ut ##is in those with frequent infections . [SEP]
[CLS] the role of the ur ##ina ##ry micro ##bio ##me in maintaining ur ##ina ##ry tract health is not well understood as of 2015 . [SEP]
[CLS] ph ##ena ##zo ##py ##rid ##ine is occasionally prescribed during the first few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use , specifically an elevated risk of met ##hem ##og ##lo ##bine ##mia ( higher than normal level of met ##hem ##og ##lo ##bin in the blood ) . [SEP]
[CLS] if not treated it causes up to 30 % of mothers to develop p ##ye ##lone ##ph ##rit ##is and increases risk of low birth weight and pre ##ter ##m birth . [SEP]
[CLS] some also support treatment of those with diabetes mel ##lit ##us and treatment before ur ##ina ##ry tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding . [SEP]
[CLS] however , resistance to flu ##oro ##quin ##olo ##nes among the bacteria that cause ur ##ina ##ry infections has been increasing . [SEP]
[CLS] the food and drug administration ( fda ) recommends against the use of flu ##oro ##quin ##olo ##nes when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects . [SEP]
[CLS] the infectious diseases society of america states this due to the concern of generating resistance to this class of medication . [SEP]
[CLS] for simple ut ##is , children often respond to a three - day course of antibiotics . [SEP]
[CLS] women with rec ##urrent simple ut ##is are over 90 % accurate in identifying new infections . [SEP]
[CLS] p ##ye ##lone ##ph ##rit ##is is treated more aggressively than a simple bladder infection using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intra ##ven ##ous antibiotics . [SEP]
[CLS] seven days of the oral flu ##oro ##quin ##olo ##ne ci ##pro ##fl ##ox ##ac ##in is typically used in areas where the resistance rate is less than 10 % . [SEP]
[CLS] if the local resistance rates are greater than 10 % , a dose of intra ##ven ##ous ce ##ft ##ria ##xon ##e is often prescribed . [SEP]
[CLS] complications such as ur ##ina ##ry obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] they occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35 ##year ##s , with 10 % of women getting an infection yearly and more than 40 – 60 % having an infection at some point in their lives . [SEP]
[CLS] rec ##ur ##rence ##s are common , with nearly half of people getting a second infection within a year . [SEP]
[CLS] they are the most common cause of hospital acquired infections accounting for approximately 40 % . [SEP]
[CLS] rates of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic bacteria in the urine increase with age from two to seven percent in women of child bearing age to as high as 50 % in elderly women in care homes . [SEP]
[CLS] among children , ur ##ina ##ry tract infections are most common in un ##ci ##rc ##um ##cise ##d males less than three months of age , followed by females less than one year . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , ur ##ina ##ry tract infections account for nearly seven million office visits , a million emergency department visits , and one hundred thousand hospital ##izations every year . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states the direct cost of treatment is estimated at 1 . 6 ##bill ##ion ##us ##d yearly . [SEP]
[CLS] effective treatment did not occur until the development and availability of antibiotics in the 1930s before which time herbs , blood ##lett ##ing and rest were recommended . [SEP]
[CLS] during pregnancy , high pro ##ges ##ter ##one levels el ##eva ##te the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ur ##eter ##s and bladder , which leads to a greater likelihood of ref ##lux , where urine flows back up the ur ##eter ##s and towards the kidney ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] while pregnant women do not have an increased risk of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic ba ##cter ##iu ##ria , if ba ##cter ##iu ##ria is present they do have a 25 – 40 % risk of a kidney infection . [SEP]
[CLS] ce ##pha ##le ##xin or ni ##tro ##fur ##anto ##in are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] a kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre - ec ##lam ##ps ##ia ( a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some women have ut ##is that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections . [SEP]
