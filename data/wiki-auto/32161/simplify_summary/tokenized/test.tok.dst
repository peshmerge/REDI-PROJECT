[CLS] a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection ( ut ##i ) is an infection that affects part of the ur ##ina ##ry tract . [SEP]
[CLS] when it affects the lower ur ##ina ##ry tract it is known as a bladder infection ( cy ##sti ##tis ) and when it affects the upper ur ##ina ##ry tract it is known as a kidney infection ( p ##ye ##lone ##ph ##rit ##is ) . [SEP]
[CLS] symptoms from a lower ur ##ina ##ry tract infection include pain with ur ##ination , frequent ur ##ination , and feeling the need to ur ##inate despite having an empty bladder . [SEP]
[CLS] symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower ut ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] rarely the urine may appear bloody . [SEP]
[CLS] in the very old and the very young , symptoms may be vague or non - specific . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common cause of infection is " es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli " , though other bacteria or fungi may rarely be the cause . [SEP]
[CLS] risk factors include female anatomy , sexual intercourse , diabetes , obesity , and family history . [SEP]
[CLS] although sexual intercourse is a risk factor , ut ##is are not classified as sexually transmitted infections ( st ##is ) . [SEP]
[CLS] kidney infection , if it occurs , usually follows a bladder infection but may also result from a blood - borne infection . [SEP]
[CLS] diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone . [SEP]
[CLS] in those with vague symptoms , diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection . [SEP]
[CLS] in complicated cases or if treatment fails , a urine culture may be useful . [SEP]
[CLS] in un ##com ##pl ##icated cases , ut ##is are treated with a short course of antibiotics such as ni ##tro ##fur ##anto ##in or trim ##eth ##op ##rim / sul ##fa ##met ##ho ##xa ##zo ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] resistance to many of the antibiotics used to treat this condition is increasing . [SEP]
[CLS] in complicated cases , a longer course or intra ##ven ##ous antibiotics may be needed . [SEP]
[CLS] if symptoms do not improve in two or three days , further diagnostic testing may be needed . [SEP]
[CLS] ph ##ena ##zo ##py ##rid ##ine may help with symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] in those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms , antibiotics are generally not needed , although during pregnancy is an exception . [SEP]
[CLS] in those with frequent infections , a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long - term antibiotics may be used as a prevent ##ative measure . [SEP]
[CLS] about 150 ##mill ##ion people develop a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection in a given year . [SEP]
[CLS] they are more common in women than men . [SEP]
[CLS] in women , they are the most common form of bacterial infection . [SEP]
[CLS] up to 10 % of women have a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection in a given year , and half of women have at least one infection at some point in their lifetime . [SEP]
[CLS] they occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35 ##year ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ur ##ina ##ry tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the e ##bers papyrus dated to c . 1550 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] lower ur ##ina ##ry tract infection is also referred to as a bladder infection . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common symptoms are burning with ur ##ination and having to ur ##inate frequently ( or an urge to ur ##inate ) in the absence of va ##ginal discharge and significant pain . [SEP]
[CLS] these symptoms may vary from mild to severe and in healthy women last an average of six ##day ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] some pain above the pub ##ic bone or in the lower back may be present . [SEP]
[CLS] people experiencing an upper ur ##ina ##ry tract infection , or p ##ye ##lone ##ph ##rit ##is , may experience flank pain , fever , or nausea and vomiting in addition to the classic symptoms of a lower ur ##ina ##ry tract infection . [SEP]
[CLS] rarely , the urine may appear bloody or contain visible pu ##s in the urine . [SEP]
[CLS] in young children , the only sy ##mpt ##om of a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection ( ut ##i ) may be a fever . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the lack of more obvious symptoms , when females under the age of two or un ##ci ##rc ##um ##cise ##d males less than a year exhibit a fever , a culture of the urine is recommended by many medical associations . [SEP]
[CLS] infants may feed poorly , vomit , sleep more , or show signs of ja ##und ##ice . [SEP]
[CLS] in older children , new onset ur ##ina ##ry inc ##ont ##inen ##ce ( loss of bladder control ) may occur . [SEP]
[CLS] ur ##ina ##ry tract symptoms are frequently lacking in the elderly . [SEP]
[CLS] the presentations may be vague with inc ##ont ##inen ##ce , a change in mental status , or fatigue as the only symptoms , while some present to a health care provider with sep ##sis , an infection of the blood , as the first symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] diagnosis can be complicated by the fact that many elderly people have pre ##ex ##ist ##ing inc ##ont ##inen ##ce or dementia . [SEP]
[CLS] it is reasonable to obtain a urine culture in those with signs of systemic infection that may be unable to report ur ##ina ##ry symptoms , such as when advanced dementia is present . [SEP]
[CLS] systemic signs of infection include a fever or increase in temperature of more than 1 . 1 c - change from usual , chill ##s , and an increased white blood cell count . [SEP]
[CLS] ur ##opa ##th ##ogenic " e . coli " from the gut is the cause of 80 – 85 % of community - acquired ur ##ina ##ry tract infections , with " st ##ap ##hyl ##oco ##ccus sap ##rop ##hy ##ticus " being the cause in 5 – 10 % . [SEP]
[CLS] rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections . [SEP]
[CLS] healthcare - associated ur ##ina ##ry tract infections ( mostly related to ur ##ina ##ry cat ##het ##eri ##zation ) involve a much broader range of pathogen ##s including : " e . coli " ( 27 % ) , " k ##le ##bs ##iel ##la " ( 11 % ) , " pseudo ##mona ##s " ( 11 % ) , the fungal pathogen " candi ##da al ##bic ##ans " ( 9 % ) , and " enter ##oco ##ccus " ( 7 % ) among others . [SEP]
[CLS] ur ##ina ##ry tract infections due to " st ##ap ##hyl ##oco ##ccus au ##reus " typically occur secondary to blood - borne infections . [SEP]
[CLS] " ch ##lam ##yd ##ia tr ##ach ##oma ##tis " and " my ##co ##pl ##as ##ma gen ##ital ##ium " can in ##fect the ur ##eth ##ra but not the bladder . [SEP]
[CLS] these infections are usually classified as a ur ##eth ##rit ##is rather than ur ##ina ##ry tract infection . [SEP]
[CLS] in young sexually active women , sexual activity is the cause of 75 – 90 % of bladder infections , with the risk of infection related to the frequency of sex . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " honeymoon cy ##sti ##tis " has been applied to this phenomenon of frequent ut ##is during early marriage . [SEP]
[CLS] in post - men ##opa ##usa ##l women , sexual activity does not affect the risk of developing a ut ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] sperm ##icide use , independent of sexual frequency , increases the risk of ut ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] dia ##ph ##rag ##m use is also associated . [SEP]
[CLS] condom use without sperm ##icide or use of birth control pills does not increase the risk of un ##com ##pl ##icated ur ##ina ##ry tract infection . [SEP]
[CLS] women are more prone to ut ##is than men because , in females , the ur ##eth ##ra is much shorter and closer to the an ##us . [SEP]
[CLS] as a woman ' s est ##rogen levels decrease with men ##opa ##use , her risk of ur ##ina ##ry tract infections increases due to the loss of protective va ##ginal flora . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , va ##ginal at ##rop ##hy that can sometimes occur after men ##opa ##use is associated with rec ##urrent ur ##ina ##ry tract infections . [SEP]
[CLS] chronic pro ##sta ##ti ##tis in the forms of chronic pro ##sta ##ti ##tis / chronic pe ##l ##vic pain syndrome and chronic bacterial pro ##sta ##ti ##tis ( not acute bacterial pro ##sta ##ti ##tis or as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic inflammatory pro ##sta ##ti ##tis ) may cause rec ##urrent ur ##ina ##ry tract infections in males . [SEP]
[CLS] risk of infections increases as males age . [SEP]
[CLS] while bacteria is commonly present in the urine of older males this does not appear to affect the risk of ur ##ina ##ry tract infections . [SEP]
[CLS] ur ##ina ##ry cat ##het ##eri ##zation increases the risk for ur ##ina ##ry tract infections . [SEP]
[CLS] the risk of ba ##cter ##iu ##ria ( bacteria in the urine ) is between three and six percent per day and prop ##hyl ##actic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic infections . [SEP]
[CLS] the risk of an associated infection can be decreased by cat ##het ##eri ##zing only when necessary , using as ##ept ##ic technique for insertion , and maintaining uno ##bs ##truct ##ed closed drainage of the cat ##het ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] male scuba divers using condom cat ##het ##ers and female divers using external catching devices for their dry suits are also susceptible to ur ##ina ##ry tract infections . [SEP]
[CLS] a pre ##dis ##position for bladder infections may run in families . [SEP]
[CLS] this is believed to be related to genetics . [SEP]
[CLS] other risk factors include diabetes , being un ##ci ##rc ##um ##cise ##d , and having a large prostate . [SEP]
[CLS] in children ut ##is are associated with ve ##sic ##our ##eter ##al ref ##lux ( an abnormal movement of urine from the bladder into ur ##eter ##s or kidney ##s ) and con ##sti ##pati ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] persons with spinal cord injury are at increased risk for ur ##ina ##ry tract infection in part because of chronic use of cat ##het ##er , and in part because of void ##ing dysfunction . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the most common cause of infection in this population , as well as the most common cause of hospital ##ization . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , use of cr ##an ##berry juice or cr ##an ##berry supplement appears to be ineffective in prevention and treatment in this population . [SEP]
[CLS] the bacteria that cause ur ##ina ##ry tract infections typically enter the bladder via the ur ##eth ##ra . [SEP]
[CLS] however , infection may also occur via the blood or l ##ym ##ph . [SEP]
[CLS] it is believed that the bacteria are usually transmitted to the ur ##eth ##ra from the bow ##el , with females at greater risk due to their anatomy . [SEP]
[CLS] after gaining entry to the bladder , " e . coli " are able to attach to the bladder wall and form a bio ##film that resist ##s the body ' s immune response . [SEP]
[CLS] " es ##cher ##ichi ##a coli " is the single most common micro ##org ##ani ##sm , followed by " k ##le ##bs ##iel ##la " and " pro ##te ##us " spp . , to cause ur ##ina ##ry tract infection . [SEP]
[CLS] " k ##le ##bs ##iel ##la " and " pro ##te ##us " spp . , are frequently associated with stone disease . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence of gram positive bacteria such as " enter ##oco ##ccus " and " st ##ap ##hyl ##oco ##ccus " increased . [SEP]
[CLS] the increased resistance of ur ##ina ##ry pathogen ##s to qui ##no ##lone antibiotics has been reported worldwide and might be the consequence of over ##use and mis ##use of qui ##no ##lone ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in straightforward cases , a diagnosis may be made and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation . [SEP]
[CLS] in complicated or questionable cases , it may be useful to confirm the diagnosis via ur ##inal ##ysis , looking for the presence of ur ##ina ##ry ni ##tri ##tes , white blood cells ( le ##uk ##ocytes ) , or le ##uk ##oc ##yte este ##rase . [SEP]
[CLS] another test , urine microscopy , looks for the presence of red blood cells , white blood cells , or bacteria . [SEP]
[CLS] urine culture is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 10 colony - forming units per ml of a typical ur ##ina ##ry tract organism . [SEP]
[CLS] anti ##biotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures , making them useful in the selection of anti ##biotic treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] however , women with negative cultures may still improve with anti ##biotic treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] as symptoms can be vague and without reliable tests for ur ##ina ##ry tract infections , diagnosis can be difficult in the elderly . [SEP]
[CLS] a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection may involve only the lower ur ##ina ##ry tract , in which case it is known as a bladder infection . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatively , it may involve the upper ur ##ina ##ry tract , in which case it is known as p ##ye ##lone ##ph ##rit ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] if the urine contains significant bacteria but there are no symptoms , the condition is known as as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic ba ##cter ##iu ##ria . [SEP]
[CLS] if a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection involves the upper tract , and the person has diabetes mel ##lit ##us , is pregnant , is male , or im ##mun ##oco ##mp ##rom ##ised , it is considered complicated . [SEP]
[CLS] otherwise if a woman is healthy and prem ##eno ##pa ##usa ##l it is considered un ##com ##pl ##icated . [SEP]
[CLS] in children when a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection is associated with a fever , it is deemed to be an upper ur ##ina ##ry tract infection . [SEP]
[CLS] to make the diagnosis of a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection in children , a positive ur ##ina ##ry culture is required . [SEP]
[CLS] contamination poses a frequent challenge depending on the method of collection used , thus a cut ##off of 10 ##c ##fu / ml is used for a " clean - catch " mid stream sample , 10 ##c ##fu / ml is used for cat ##het ##er - obtained specimens , and 10 ##c ##fu / ml is used for su ##pr ##ap ##ub ##ic aspirations ( a sample drawn directly from the bladder with a needle ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of " urine bags " to collect samples is discouraged by the world health organization due to the high rate of contamination when culture ##d , and cat ##het ##eri ##zation is preferred in those not toilet trained . [SEP]
[CLS] some , such as the american academy of pediatric ##s recommends renal ultrasound and void ##ing cy ##sto ##ure ##th ##ro ##gram ( watching a person ' s ur ##eth ##ra and ur ##ina ##ry bladder with real time x - rays while they ur ##inate ) in all children less than two years old who have had a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection . [SEP]
[CLS] however , because there is a lack of effective treatment if problems are found , others such as the national institute for health and care excellence only recommends routine imaging in those less than six months old or who have unusual findings . [SEP]
[CLS] in women with ce ##r ##vic ##itis ( inflammation of the ce ##r ##vi ##x ) or va ##gin ##itis ( inflammation of the va ##gina ) and in young men with ut ##i symptoms , a " ch ##lam ##yd ##ia tr ##ach ##oma ##tis " or " ne ##isse ##ria go ##nor ##rh ##oe ##ae " infection may be the cause . [SEP]
[CLS] these infections are typically classified as a ur ##eth ##rit ##is rather than a ur ##ina ##ry tract infection . [SEP]
[CLS] va ##gin ##itis may also be due to a yeast infection . [SEP]
[CLS] inter ##sti ##tial cy ##sti ##tis ( chronic pain in the bladder ) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of ut ##i symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics . [SEP]
[CLS] pro ##sta ##ti ##tis ( inflammation of the prostate ) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis . [SEP]
[CLS] hem ##or ##rh ##agi ##c cy ##sti ##tis , characterized by blood in the urine , can occur secondary to a number of causes including : infections , radiation therapy , underlying cancer , medications and toxin ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] medications that commonly cause this problem include the che ##mot ##her ##ape ##uti ##c agent cy ##cl ##op ##hos ##pha ##mide with rates of 2 to 40 % . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##osi ##no ##phi ##lic cy ##sti ##tis is a rare condition where e ##osi ##no ##phile ##s are present in the bladder wall . [SEP]
[CLS] signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection . [SEP]
[CLS] its cause is not entirely clear ; however , it may be linked to food all ##er ##gies , infections , and medications among others . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of measures have not been confirmed to affect ut ##i frequency including : ur ##inating immediately after intercourse , the type of underwear used , personal hygiene methods used after ur ##inating or def ##eca ##ting , or whether a person typically bath ##es or showers . [SEP]
[CLS] there is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one ' s urine , tam ##pon use , and do ##uchi ##ng . [SEP]
[CLS] in those with frequent ur ##ina ##ry tract infections who use sperm ##icide or a dia ##ph ##rag ##m as a method of contra ##ception , they are advised to use alternative methods . [SEP]
[CLS] in those with benign pro ##static hyper ##pl ##asia ur ##inating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder empty ##ing which might decrease ur ##ina ##ry tract infections in this group . [SEP]
[CLS] using ur ##ina ##ry cat ##het ##ers as little and as short of time as possible and appropriate care of the cat ##het ##er when used prevents cat ##het ##er - associated ur ##ina ##ry tract infections . [SEP]
[CLS] they should be inserted using sterile technique in hospital however non - sterile technique may be appropriate in those who self cat ##het ##eri ##ze . [SEP]
[CLS] the ur ##ina ##ry cat ##het ##er set up should also be kept sealed . [SEP]
[CLS] evidence does not support a significant decrease in risk when silver - alloy cat ##het ##ers are used . [SEP]
[CLS] for those with rec ##urrent infections , taking a short course of antibiotics when each infection occurs is associated with the lowest anti ##biotic use . [SEP]
[CLS] a prolonged course of daily antibiotics is also effective . [SEP]
[CLS] medications frequently used include ni ##tro ##fur ##anto ##in and trim ##eth ##op ##rim / sul ##fa ##met ##ho ##xa ##zo ##le ( t ##mp / sm ##x ) . [SEP]
[CLS] met ##hen ##amine is another agent used for this purpose as in the bladder where the acid ##ity is low it produces formal ##deh ##yde to which resistance does not develop . [SEP]
[CLS] some recommend against prolonged use due to concerns of anti ##biotic resistance . [SEP]
[CLS] in cases where infections are related to intercourse , taking antibiotics afterwards may be useful . [SEP]
[CLS] in post - men ##opa ##usa ##l women , topical va ##ginal est ##rogen has been found to reduce rec ##ur ##rence . [SEP]
[CLS] as opposed to topical cream ##s , the use of va ##ginal est ##rogen from pe ##ssar ##ies has not been as useful as low dose antibiotics . [SEP]
[CLS] antibiotics following short term ur ##ina ##ry cat ##het ##eri ##zation decreases the subsequent risk of a bladder infection . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of vaccines are in development as of 2018 . [SEP]
[CLS] the evidence that prevent ##ive antibiotics decrease ur ##ina ##ry tract infections in children is poor . [SEP]
[CLS] however rec ##urrent ut ##is are a rare cause of further kidney problems if there are no underlying abnormalities of the kidney ##s , resulting in less than a third of a percent ( 0 . 33 % ) of chronic kidney disease in adults . [SEP]
[CLS] whether routine ci ##rc ##um ##cision prevents ut ##is has not been well studied as of 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] some research suggests that cr ##an ##berry ( juice or capsule ##s ) may decrease the number of ut ##is in those with frequent infections . [SEP]
[CLS] a cochrane review concluded that the benefit , if it exists , is small . [SEP]
[CLS] long - term tolerance is also an issue with gas ##tro ##int ##estinal upset occurring in more than 30 % . [SEP]
[CLS] cr ##an ##berry juice is thus not currently recommended for this indication . [SEP]
[CLS] as of 2015 , pro ##biotic ##s require further study to determine if they are beneficial . [SEP]
[CLS] the role of the ur ##ina ##ry micro ##bio ##me in maintaining ur ##ina ##ry tract health is not well understood as of 2015 . [SEP]
[CLS] the main ##sta ##y of treatment is antibiotics . [SEP]
[CLS] ph ##ena ##zo ##py ##rid ##ine is occasionally prescribed during the first few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use , specifically an elevated risk of met ##hem ##og ##lo ##bine ##mia ( higher than normal level of met ##hem ##og ##lo ##bin in the blood ) . [SEP]
[CLS] ace ##tam ##ino ##ph ##en ( para ##ce ##tam ##ol ) may be used for fever ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no good evidence for the use of cr ##an ##berry products for treating current infections . [SEP]
[CLS] those who have bacteria in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics . [SEP]
[CLS] this includes those who are old , those with spinal cord injuries , and those who have ur ##ina ##ry cat ##het ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that women take 7 ##day ##s of antibiotics . [SEP]
[CLS] if not treated it causes up to 30 % of mothers to develop p ##ye ##lone ##ph ##rit ##is and increases risk of low birth weight and pre ##ter ##m birth . [SEP]
[CLS] some also support treatment of those with diabetes mel ##lit ##us and treatment before ur ##ina ##ry tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding . [SEP]
[CLS] un ##com ##pl ##icated infections can be diagnosed and treated based on symptoms alone . [SEP]
[CLS] antibiotics taken by mouth such as trim ##eth ##op ##rim / sul ##fa ##met ##ho ##xa ##zo ##le ( t ##mp / sm ##x ) , ni ##tro ##fur ##anto ##in , or f ##os ##fo ##my ##cin are typically first line . [SEP]
[CLS] ce ##pha ##los ##por ##ins , am ##ox ##ici ##llin / cl ##av ##ula ##nic acid , or a flu ##oro ##quin ##olo ##ne may also be used . [SEP]
[CLS] however , resistance to flu ##oro ##quin ##olo ##nes among the bacteria that cause ur ##ina ##ry infections has been increasing . [SEP]
[CLS] the food and drug administration ( fda ) recommends against the use of flu ##oro ##quin ##olo ##nes when other options are available due to higher risks of serious side effects . [SEP]
[CLS] these medications substantially short ##en the time to recovery with all being equally effective . [SEP]
[CLS] a three - day treatment with trim ##eth ##op ##rim , t ##mp / sm ##x , or a flu ##oro ##quin ##olo ##ne is usually sufficient , whereas ni ##tro ##fur ##anto ##in requires 5 – 7 ##day ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] f ##os ##fo ##my ##cin may be used as a single dose but has been associated with lower rates of efficacy . [SEP]
[CLS] with treatment , symptoms should improve within 36 ##ho ##urs . [SEP]
[CLS] about 50 % of people will recover without treatment within a few days or weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] flu ##oro ##quin ##olo ##nes are not recommended as a first treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] the infectious diseases society of america states this due to the concern of generating resistance to this class of medication . [SEP]
[CLS] am ##ox ##ici ##llin - cl ##av ##ula ##nate appears less effective than other options . [SEP]
[CLS] despite this pre ##ca ##ution , some resistance has developed to all of these medications related to their widespread use . [SEP]
[CLS] trim ##eth ##op ##rim alone is deemed to be equivalent to t ##mp / sm ##x in some countries . [SEP]
[CLS] for simple ut ##is , children often respond to a three - day course of antibiotics . [SEP]
[CLS] women with rec ##urrent simple ut ##is are over 90 % accurate in identifying new infections . [SEP]
[CLS] they may benefit from self - treatment upon occurrence of symptoms with medical follow - up only if the initial treatment fails . [SEP]
[CLS] complicated ut ##is are more difficult to treat and usually requires more aggressive evaluation , treatment and follow - up . [SEP]
[CLS] it may require identifying and addressing the underlying com ##plication . [SEP]
[CLS] increasing anti ##biotic resistance is causing concern about the future of treating those with complicated and rec ##urrent ut ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] p ##ye ##lone ##ph ##rit ##is is treated more aggressively than a simple bladder infection using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intra ##ven ##ous antibiotics . [SEP]
[CLS] seven days of the oral flu ##oro ##quin ##olo ##ne ci ##pro ##fl ##ox ##ac ##in is typically used in areas where the resistance rate is less than 10 % . [SEP]
[CLS] if the local resistance rates are greater than 10 % , a dose of intra ##ven ##ous ce ##ft ##ria ##xon ##e is often prescribed . [SEP]
[CLS] trim ##eth ##op ##rim / sul ##fa ##met ##ho ##xa ##zo ##le or am ##ox ##ici ##llin / cl ##av ##ula ##nate oral ##ly for 14 days is another reasonable option . [SEP]
[CLS] in those who exhibit more severe symptoms , admission to a hospital for ongoing antibiotics may be needed . [SEP]
[CLS] complications such as ur ##ina ##ry obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] ur ##ina ##ry tract infections are the most frequent bacterial infection in women . [SEP]
[CLS] they occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35 ##year ##s , with 10 % of women getting an infection yearly and more than 40 – 60 % having an infection at some point in their lives . [SEP]
[CLS] rec ##ur ##rence ##s are common , with nearly half of people getting a second infection within a year . [SEP]
[CLS] ur ##ina ##ry tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males . [SEP]
[CLS] p ##ye ##lone ##ph ##rit ##is occurs between 20 – 30 times less frequently . [SEP]
[CLS] they are the most common cause of hospital acquired infections accounting for approximately 40 % . [SEP]
[CLS] rates of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic bacteria in the urine increase with age from two to seven percent in women of child bearing age to as high as 50 % in elderly women in care homes . [SEP]
[CLS] rates of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic bacteria in the urine among men over 75 are between 7 - 10 % . [SEP]
[CLS] as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic bacteria in the urine occurs in 2 % to 10 % of pre ##gnan ##cies . [SEP]
[CLS] ur ##ina ##ry tract infections may affect 10 % of people during childhood . [SEP]
[CLS] among children , ur ##ina ##ry tract infections are most common in un ##ci ##rc ##um ##cise ##d males less than three months of age , followed by females less than one year . [SEP]
[CLS] estimates of frequency among children , however , vary widely . [SEP]
[CLS] in a group of children with a fever , ranging in age between birth and two years , two to 20 % were diagnosed with a ut ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , ur ##ina ##ry tract infections account for nearly seven million office visits , a million emergency department visits , and one hundred thousand hospital ##izations every year . [SEP]
[CLS] the cost of these infections is significant both in terms of lost time at work and costs of medical care . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states the direct cost of treatment is estimated at 1 . 6 ##bill ##ion ##us ##d yearly . [SEP]
[CLS] ur ##ina ##ry tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the e ##bers papyrus dated to c . 1550 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] it was described by the egyptians as " sending forth heat from the bladder " . [SEP]
[CLS] effective treatment did not occur until the development and availability of antibiotics in the 1930s before which time herbs , blood ##lett ##ing and rest were recommended . [SEP]
[CLS] ur ##ina ##ry tract infections are more concerning in pregnancy due to the increased risk of kidney infections . [SEP]
[CLS] during pregnancy , high pro ##ges ##ter ##one levels el ##eva ##te the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ur ##eter ##s and bladder , which leads to a greater likelihood of ref ##lux , where urine flows back up the ur ##eter ##s and towards the kidney ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] while pregnant women do not have an increased risk of as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic ba ##cter ##iu ##ria , if ba ##cter ##iu ##ria is present they do have a 25 – 40 % risk of a kidney infection . [SEP]
[CLS] thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection — even in the absence of symptoms — treatment is recommended . [SEP]
[CLS] ce ##pha ##le ##xin or ni ##tro ##fur ##anto ##in are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] a kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre - ec ##lam ##ps ##ia ( a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some women have ut ##is that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections . [SEP]
