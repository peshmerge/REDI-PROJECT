Kabuki is the traditional Japanese classical drama which started about 400 years ago.
It is known for its very stylized acting and the elaborate makeup worn by the actors.
The word kabuki means "singing and dancing".
It also means strange and different, to be outside what is normal.
Kabuki is not meant to look like real life.
People from around the world are now interested in Kabuki.
It was recognized by UNESCO in 2006 as an important part of Japan's cultural history.
Kabuki theater started during the Edo period (1603—1868).
It developed into what we now know as kabuki during the "Genroku" (1688—1704).
Kabuki was started by a woman, Izumo no Okuni, who performed in the dry river bed in Kyoto in 1603.
It was very popular, especially because many of the stories and dance moves were about sex.
Many of the women performers were probably prostitutes.
Women were banned from performing in Kabuki plays in 1629 because it was thought to disturb discipline.
They were replaced by beautiful young men to play the female roles, but in 1652 they were banned for the same reasons as the women.
Kabuki was allowed to continue with adult men playing all the roles, Yaro kabuki, the style that has became famous.
After the "Genroku" era, Kabuki became popular in Japanese cities, growing rapidly as proper theater with great authors and actors.
"Ningyo Jyoruri" (the puppet theater) also influenced the stories, directions, content and style.
Ballet and theater music, such as "Nagauta", "Tokiwadubushi" and "Kiyomotobushi" were also influences on the development of kabuki.
After the restoration of the Emperor in 1888, kabuki was influenced by foreign culture, stimulated by the rise of new drama.
In "Showa" period, from 1926 to 1989, performances began in other countries.
The Empire Theater was reconstructed, and called the National Theater.
In 1954, East Side Theater was made, and Kabuki stage shown on TV.
In 1965, Kabuki was seen as an important cultural heritage.
After World War II, the Japanese came to see that Kabuki as an important part of their culture.
Many actors became famous people in Japan.
Woman kabuki actors are rare though there was "onnakabuki".
The "onnakabuki" is woman’s kabuki.
Now the men play both male and female roles.
There are famous kabuki actors in Japan such as Danjuro Ichikawa, Ebizo Ichikawa and Koshiro Matsumoto.
Danjuro Ichikawa is an especially famous kabuki actor.
He started "aragoto" at the age only of 14.
The "aragoto" is a kabuki genre dealing with a brave warrior, a fierce god, or a demon.
He also wrote kabuki plays under the name of Hyogo Mimasuya.
The name of a kabuki actor usually is passed on from one generation to the next.
Therefore the name of an actor is passes to the next generation.
Kabuki actors do not perform only kabuki but also act in TV drama and movies.
Koshiro Matsumoto often appears on TV.
Kabuki theaters are very unique.
In the Genroku era, kabuki was influenced by "nou" or "kyougen" which were the theater styles made before "kabuki".
In this period there was no roof for audiences, so that if it rained, actors could not perform.
In the Edo period, all seats were covered with a roof.
"Mawari-butai", a revolving stage, began in the Kyōhō era (1716–1735).
Scenes are built on the revolving stage and when a new scene is needed they simply rotate the stage; it makes progress of plays move quickly and easily.
Foreign theaters have copied this kabuki invention.
Other unique system is "hanamichi" or "flower path".
This is a walkway which crosses the auditorium at the same height as the stage.
Actors can use this walkway to enter or leave the stage.
During a play it can become many kinds of places.
For example, it can be a river, a road, a corridor and so on.
The most famous theatre in Japan is the "Kabuki-za".
It was built in Tokyo in 1889.
It was built as western-style theater.
The interior decorations were Japanese style but the outside was brick walls and it was a three-storied theater at first.
The interior decorations and outside changed many time.
Kabuki theaters have long histories and these were so unique.
Famous authors of kabuki plays include Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653—1724), Tsuruya Nanmboku (1755—1829), and Kawatake Mokuami (1816—1893).
Kabuki plays can be put into three main groups "Jidaimono", "Sewamono" and "Shosagoto".
The "Jidaimono" are plays which show the world of samurais or court nobles before the Edo period.
The government banned performances that showed the history of the Edo period.
"Sewamono" are plays about the lives of the town people in the Edo period.
"Shosagoto" are plays that feature dance.
"Gidayu kyogen" or "Maruhonmono" are kabuki plays that were first written as puppet plays.
They were turned into kabuki plays when they became famous.
"Shin kabuki" are plays which were written by writers who did not normally write kabuki plays.
Kabuki makeup helps audiences understand each character's role.
It is special and emphasizes beauty of form.
If an actor plays the role of a daughter or a man in love, he must apply makeup.
First, he rubs grease, which is made of canola oil and perfume, into his face.
Second, he paints out eyebrow with grease.
Third, he rubs face powder on chest, neck, long hair and spreads powder with sponge.
Next, he rubs face powder on face with sponge.
Also, he puts rouge on nose, eyes cheek and the outer corner of the eye.
He paints his eyebrow from red to black and he rubs lip with red lip stick and traces the outline clearly.
If the actor is playing a brave man, called "Aragoto", he paints on rouge with red and black lines, "Kumadori", to show brave feelings.
"Kumadori" is a type of kabuki's make up.
It was started in 1673 by Danjyurou Ichikawa.
It shows the character's role, for example, "Sujiguma" is one of the "kamadori" showing a super hero.
Modern Japanese has a lot of words that came from kabuki words.
For example, there are three famous words; the first is an "ohako".
"Ohako" means skillful things.
Japanese often say the "ohako" is own good tune with karaoke.
The "ohako" is derived word from Danjuro Ichikawa.
He kept the kabuki plays of his good kabuki in a box.
The "ohako" originated in there.
The second is a "nimaime".
The "nimaime" means a good-looking man.
The "nimaime" was written secondarily from the right in the signboard of the kabuki.
Therefore it came to be said so.
The third is a "sanmaime".
The "sanmaime" means a comedian.
The origin of this word is the same as "nimaime", "sanmaime" was written third from the right in the signboard of the kabuki.
Now Kabuki actors often perform for foreign audiences.
The group "Heisei Nakamuraza" directed by Nakamura Kanzaburou have become famous for their performances in foreign countries.
They were the first traditional style kabuki group to perform in New York City in 2004, with actor Nakamura Kankuro V. Using a tent as a playhouse near opera house, with the audience seated on tatami (Japanese mats), they performed "The Summer Festival: A Mirror of Osaka" with Japanese actors.
In July 2008, "Heisei Nakamuraza" again performed in New York and they played in English.
It was a historical and splendid achievement.
In Australia, the Za Kabuki group at the Australian National University has been performing a kabuki drama each year since 1976; the single longest regular kabuki performance outside of Japan.
