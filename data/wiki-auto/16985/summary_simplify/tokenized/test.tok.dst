[CLS] in 2005 , the " ka ##bu ##ki theatre " was proclaimed by unesco as an int ##ang ##ible heritage possessing outstanding universal value . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2008 , it was inscribed in the unesco representative list of the int ##ang ##ible cultural heritage of humanity . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki is therefore sometimes translated as " the art of singing and dancing " . [SEP]
[CLS] it is often translated into english as " strange things " or " the crazy ones " , and referred to the style of dress worn by gangs of samurai . [SEP]
[CLS] the history of ka ##bu ##ki began in 1603 when i ##zu ##mo no ok ##uni , possibly a mi ##ko of i ##zu ##mo - tai ##sha , began performing with a troupe of female dancers a new style of dance drama , on a makeshift stage in the dry bed of the kam ##o river in kyoto . [SEP]
[CLS] japan was under the control of the tokugawa sho ##gun ##ate , enforced by tokugawa ie ##yas ##u . [SEP]
[CLS] the name of the edo period derives from the relocation of the tokugawa regime from its former home in kyoto to the city of edo , present - day tokyo . [SEP]
[CLS] the style was immediately popular , and ok ##uni was asked to perform before the imperial court . [SEP]
[CLS] in the wake of such success , rival troupe ##s quickly formed , and ka ##bu ##ki was born as ensemble dance and drama performed by women — a form very different from its modern incarnation . [SEP]
[CLS] much of its appeal in this era was due to the rib ##ald , suggest ##ive themes featured by many troupe ##s ; this appeal was further augmented by the fact that the performers were often also available for prostitution . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki became a common form of entertainment in the uk ##iy ##o , or yo ##shi ##wara , the registered red - light district in edo . [SEP]
[CLS] a diverse crowd gathered under one roof , something that happened nowhere else in the city . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki theaters were a place to see and be seen as they featured the latest fashion trends and current events . [SEP]
[CLS] the tea ##houses surrounding or connected to the theater provided meals , ref ##resh ##ments , and good company . [SEP]
[CLS] the area around the theatres was filled with shops selling ka ##bu ##ki so ##uven ##irs . [SEP]
[CLS] the sho ##gun ##ate was never partial to ka ##bu ##ki and all the mischief it brought , particularly the variety of the social classes which mixed at ka ##bu ##ki performances . [SEP]
[CLS] the theatre remained popular , and remained a focus of urban lifestyle until modern times . [SEP]
[CLS] although ka ##bu ##ki was performed all over uk ##iy ##o and other portions for the country , the nakamura - za , ich ##im ##ura - za and ka ##wara ##zaki - za theatres became the top theatres in uk ##iy ##o , where some of the most successful ka ##bu ##ki performances were and still are held . [SEP]
[CLS] young ( adolescent ) men were preferred for women ' s roles due to their less masculine appearance and the higher pitch of their voices compared to adult men . [SEP]
[CLS] along with the change in the performer ' s gender came a change in the emphasis of the performance : increased stress was placed on drama rather than dance . [SEP]
[CLS] audiences frequently became row ##dy , and brawl ##s occasionally broke out , sometimes over the favors of a particularly handsome young actor , leading the sho ##gun ##ate to ban first " on ##na ##gata " and then " wa ##kas ##hu " roles . [SEP]
[CLS] the structure of a ka ##bu ##ki play was formal ##ized during this period , as were many elements of style . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki theater and " ni ##ng ##yo jo ##ru ##ri " , the elaborate form of puppet theater that later came to be known as " bun ##rak ##u " , became closely associated with each other , and each has since influenced the other ' s development . [SEP]
[CLS] the famous playwright chi ##kam ##ats ##u mon ##za ##emon , one of the first professional ka ##bu ##ki playwright ##s , produced several influential works , though the piece usually acknowledged as his most significant , " son ##eza ##ki shin ##ju " ( " the love suicide ##s at son ##eza ##ki " ) , was originally written for bun ##rak ##u . [SEP]
[CLS] like many " bun ##rak ##u " plays , it was adapted for ka ##bu ##ki , and it spawned many im ##ita ##tors — in fact , it and similar plays reportedly caused so many real - life " copy ##cat " suicide ##s that the government banned " shin ##ju mono " ( plays about lovers ' double suicide ##s ) in 1723 . [SEP]
[CLS] ich ##ika ##wa dan ##ju ##ro i also lived during this time ; he is credited with the development of " mi ##e " poses and mask - like ku ##mad ##ori make - up . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki theatres , traditionally made of wood , were constantly burning down , forcing their relocation within the uk ##iy ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] when the area that housed the nakamura - za was completely destroyed in 1841 , the sho ##gun refused to allow the theatre to be rebuilt , saying that it was against fire code . [SEP]
[CLS] the sho ##gun ##ate did not welcome the mixing and trading that occurred between town merchants and actors , artists , and prostitutes . [SEP]
[CLS] actors , stage ##hand ##s , and others associated with the performances were forced out as well . [SEP]
[CLS] these factors , along with strict regulations , pushed much of ka ##bu ##ki " underground " in edo , with performances changing locations to avoid the authorities . [SEP]
[CLS] the last thirty years of the tokugawa sho ##gun ##ate ' s rule is often referred to as the sar ##uw ##aka - mach ##i period . [SEP]
[CLS] this western interest prompted japanese artists to increase their depictions of daily life including theatres , brothel ##s , main streets and so on . [SEP]
[CLS] deemed una ##tt ##ractive , he mainly performed buy ##o , or dancing , in dramas written by ka ##wat ##ake mo ##ku ##ami , who also wrote during the meiji period to follow . [SEP]
[CLS] his ka ##bu ##ki performances became quite popular once the sar ##uw ##aka - mach ##i period ended and theatre returned to edo ; many of his works are still performed . [SEP]
[CLS] emperor meiji was restored to power and moved from kyoto to the new capital of edo , or tokyo , beginning the meiji period . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning in 1868 enormous cultural changes , such as the fall of the tokugawa sho ##gun ##ate , the elimination of the samurai class , and the opening of japan to the west , helped to spark ka ##bu ##ki ' s re - emergence . [SEP]
[CLS] as the culture struggled to adapt to the influx of foreign ideas and influence , actors st ##rove to increase the reputation of ka ##bu ##ki among the upper classes and to adapt the traditional styles to modern tastes . [SEP]
[CLS] after world war ii , the occupying forces briefly banned ka ##bu ##ki , which had strongly supported japan ' s war since 1931 ; however , by 1947 the ban had been res ##cin ##ded . [SEP]
[CLS] besides the war ' s physical devastation , many rejected the styles and thoughts of the past , ka ##bu ##ki among them . [SEP]
[CLS] director te ##tsu ##ji take ##chi ' s popular and innovative productions of ka ##bu ##ki classics at this time are credited with bringing about a rebirth of interest in ka ##bu ##ki in the kan ##sai region . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to the handful of major theatres in tokyo and kyoto , there are many smaller theatres in osaka and throughout the countryside . [SEP]
[CLS] the ich ##ika ##wa sho ##jo ka ##bu ##ki ge ##ki ##dan , an all - female troupe , debuted in 1953 to significant acclaim but failed to start a new trend . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki troupe ##s regularly tour asia , europe and america , and there have been several ka ##bu ##ki - themed productions of canonical western plays such as those of shakespeare . [SEP]
[CLS] western playwright ##s and novelist ##s have experimented with ka ##bu ##ki themes , an example of which is gerald viz ##eno ##r ' s " hiroshima bug ##i " ( 2004 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] writer yuki ##o mis ##hima pioneered and popularized the use of ka ##bu ##ki in modern settings and revived other traditional arts , such as no ##h , adapting them to modern contexts . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , in australia , the za ka ##bu ##ki troupe at the australian national university has performed a ka ##bu ##ki drama each year since 1976 , the longest regular ka ##bu ##ki performance outside japan . [SEP]
[CLS] diagonal ##ly across from the mina ##mi - za , the last remaining ka ##bu ##ki theater in kyoto , it stands at the east end of a bridge ( shi ##jo oh ##ashi ) crossing the kam ##o river in kyoto . [SEP]
[CLS] the ka ##bu ##ki stage features a projection called a " hana ##mic ##hi " ( , " flower path " ) , a walkway which extends into the audience and via which dramatic entrances and exits are made . [SEP]
[CLS] ok ##uni also performed on a hana ##mic ##hi stage with her entourage . [SEP]
[CLS] the stage is used not only as a walkway or path to get to and from the main stage , but important scenes are also played on the stage . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki stages and theaters have steadily become more technological ##ly sophisticated , and innovations including revolving stages and trap doors were introduced during the 18th century . [SEP]
[CLS] a driving force has been the desire to manifest one frequent theme of ka ##bu ##ki theater , that of the sudden , dramatic revelation or transformation . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " ke ##ren " , often translated " playing to the gallery " , is sometimes used as a catch - all for these tricks . [SEP]
[CLS] the trick was originally accomplished by the on - stage pushing of a round , wheeled platform . [SEP]
[CLS] later a circular platform was embedded in the stage with wheels beneath it facilitating movement . [SEP]
[CLS] more commonly the lights are left on for " aka ##ten " ( “ lighted rev ##ol ##ve ” ) , sometimes simultaneously performing the transition ##ing scenes for dramatic effect . [SEP]
[CLS] this stage was first built in japan in the early eighteenth century . [SEP]
[CLS] " ser ##i " refers to the stage " traps " that have been commonly employed in ka ##bu ##ki since the middle of the 18th century . [SEP]
[CLS] " chun ##ori " ( riding in mid - air ) is a technique , which appeared toward the middle of the 19th century , by which an actor ' s costume is attached to wires and he is made to " fly " over the stage and / or certain parts of the auditorium . [SEP]
[CLS] this is similar to the wire trick in the stage musical " peter pan " , in which peter launches himself into the air . [SEP]
[CLS] scenery changes are sometimes made mid - scene , while the actors remain on stage and the curtain stays open . [SEP]
[CLS] this technique originated at the beginning of the 18th century , where scenery or actors move on or off stage on a wheeled platform . [SEP]
[CLS] also common are stage ##hand ##s rushing onto the stage adding and removing props , backdrop ##s and other scenery ; these " ku ##rok ##o " are always dressed entirely in black and are traditionally considered invisible . [SEP]
[CLS] when a character ' s true nature is suddenly revealed , the devices of " hi ##kin ##uki " and " bu ##kka ##eri " are often used . [SEP]
[CLS] this involves layer ##ing one costume over another and having a stage ##hand pull the outer one off in front of the audience . [SEP]
[CLS] the curtain that shields the stage before the performance and during the breaks is in the traditional colours of black , red and green , in various order , or white instead of green , vertical stripes . [SEP]
[CLS] strict censorship laws during the edo period prohibited the representation of contemporary events and particularly prohibited critic ##ising the sho ##gun ##ate or casting it in a bad light , although enforcement varied greatly over the years . [SEP]
[CLS] many shows were set in the context of the gen ##pe ##i war of the 118 ##0s , the nan ##bo ##ku - cho wars of the 133 ##0s , or other historical events . [SEP]
[CLS] frustrating the ce ##nsor ##s , many shows used these historical settings as metaphor ##s for contemporary events . [SEP]
[CLS] " kan ##ade ##hon chu ##shing ##ura " , one of the most famous plays in the ka ##bu ##ki repertoire , serves as an excellent example ; it is ostensibly set in the 133 ##0s , though it actually depicts the contemporary ( 18th century ) affair of the revenge of the 47 " ronin " . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the most famous " se ##wa ##mon ##o " are the love suicide plays , adapted from works by the " bun ##rak ##u " playwright chi ##kam ##ats ##u ; these center on romantic couples who cannot be together in life due to various circumstances and who therefore decide to be together in death instead . [SEP]
[CLS] important elements of ka ##bu ##ki include the " mi ##e " , in which the actor holds a picturesque pose to establish his character . [SEP]
[CLS] at this point his house name ( " ya ##go " , ) is sometimes heard in loud shout ( " ka ##ke ##go ##e " , ) from an expert audience member , serving both to express and enhance the audience ' s appreciation of the actor ' s achievement . [SEP]
[CLS] an even greater compliment can be paid by shouting the name of the actor ' s father . [SEP]
[CLS] the main actor has to convey a wide variety of emotions between a fallen , drunk ##ard person and someone who in reality is quite different since he is only fa ##king his weakness , for example in the character of yu ##rano ##suke in " chu ##shing ##ura " . [SEP]
[CLS] it is technically difficult to perform and takes a long time to learn , but once mastered the audience takes up on the actor ' s emotion . [SEP]
[CLS] emotions are also expressed through the colours of the costumes , a key element in ka ##bu ##ki . [SEP]
[CLS] ga ##udy and strong colours can convey foolish or joy ##ful emotions , whereas severe or muted colours convey seriousness and focus . [SEP]
[CLS] " ke ##sho " , ka ##bu ##ki makeup , provides an element of style easily recognizable even by those unfamiliar with the art form . [SEP]
[CLS] rice powder is used to create the white " os ##hiro ##i " base for the characteristic stage makeup , and " ku ##mad ##ori " enhance ##s or ex ##agger ##ates facial lines to produce dramatic animal or supernatural masks . [SEP]
[CLS] the color of the " ku ##mad ##ori " is an expression of the character ' s nature : red lines are used to indicate passion , heroism , righteous ##ness , and other positive traits ; blue or black , villain ##y , jealousy , and other negative traits ; green , the supernatural ; and purple , nobility . [SEP]
[CLS] rather than attending for 2 – 5 hours , as one might do in a modern western - style theater , audiences " escape " from the day - to - day world , dev ##oting a full day to entertainment . [SEP]
[CLS] though some individual plays , particularly the historical " ji ##dai ##mon ##o " , might last an entire day , most were shorter and sequence ##d with other plays in order to produce a full - day program . [SEP]
[CLS] the structure of the full - day program , like the structure of the plays themselves , was derived largely from the conventions of " bun ##rak ##u " and " no ##h " , conventions which also appear in other traditional japanese arts . [SEP]
[CLS] the concept , elaborated on at length by master no ##h playwright ze ##ami , govern ##s not only the actions of the actors , but also the structure of the play as well as the structure of scenes and plays within a day - long program . [SEP]
[CLS] the first corresponds to " jo " , an aus ##pic ##ious and slow opening which introduces the audience to the characters and the plot . [SEP]
[CLS] the next three acts correspond to " ha " , speeding events up , culminating almost always in a great moment of drama or tragedy in the third act and possibly a battle in the second and / or fourth acts . [SEP]
[CLS] while many plays were originally written for ka ##bu ##ki , many others were taken from " jo ##ru ##ri " plays , no ##h plays , folklore , or other performing traditions such as the oral tradition of the " tale of the he ##ike " . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the crucial differences in the philosophy of the two forms is that " jo ##ru ##ri " focuses primarily on the story and on the chant ##er who rec ##ites it , while ka ##bu ##ki focuses more on the actors . [SEP]
[CLS] a " jo ##ru ##ri " play may sacrifice the details of sets , puppets , or action in favor of the chant ##er , while ka ##bu ##ki is known to sacrifice drama and even the plot to highlight an actor ' s talents . [SEP]
[CLS] it was not uncommon in ka ##bu ##ki to insert or remove individual scenes from a day ' s schedule in order to cater to the talents or desires of an individual actor — scenes he was famed for , or that featured him , would be inserted into a program without regard to plot continuity . [SEP]
[CLS] only towards the end of the edo period in the 19th century did the two regions adopt one another ' s styles to any significant degree . [SEP]
[CLS] for a long time , actors from one region often failed to adjust to the styles of the other region and were unsuccessful in their performance tours of that region . [SEP]
[CLS] these stage ##name ##s , most often those of the actor ' s father , grandfather , or teacher , are passed down between generations of actors ' lineage ##s , and hold great honor and importance . [SEP]
[CLS] many names are associated with certain roles or acting styles , and the new possess ##or of each name must live up to these expectations ; there is the feeling almost of the actor not only taking a name , but em ##body ##ing the spirit , style , or skill of each actor to previously hold that name . [SEP]
