[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki ( 歌 [UNK] [UNK] ) is a classical japanese dance - drama . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki theatre is known for the st ##yl ##ization of its drama and for the elaborate make - up worn by some of its performers . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2005 , the " ka ##bu ##ki theatre " was proclaimed by unesco as an int ##ang ##ible heritage possessing outstanding universal value . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2008 , it was inscribed in the unesco representative list of the int ##ang ##ible cultural heritage of humanity . [SEP]
[CLS] the individual kan ##ji , from left to right , mean " sing " , " dance " , and " skill " . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki is therefore sometimes translated as " the art of singing and dancing " . [SEP]
[CLS] these are , however , " ate ##ji " characters which do not reflect actual etymology . [SEP]
[CLS] the kan ##ji of ' skill ' generally refers to a performer in ka ##bu ##ki theatre . [SEP]
[CLS] since the word " ka ##bu ##ki " is believed to derive from the verb " ka ##bu ##ku " , meaning " to lean " or " to be out of the ordinary " , " ka ##bu ##ki " can be interpreted as " avant - garde " or " bizarre " theatre . [SEP]
[CLS] the expression " ka ##bu ##kim ##ono " referred originally to those who were bizarre ##ly dressed . [SEP]
[CLS] it is often translated into english as " strange things " or " the crazy ones " , and referred to the style of dress worn by gangs of samurai . [SEP]
[CLS] the history of ka ##bu ##ki began in 1603 when i ##zu ##mo no ok ##uni , possibly a mi ##ko of i ##zu ##mo - tai ##sha , began performing with a troupe of female dancers a new style of dance drama , on a makeshift stage in the dry bed of the kam ##o river in kyoto . [SEP]
[CLS] it originated in the 17th century . [SEP]
[CLS] japan was under the control of the tokugawa sho ##gun ##ate , enforced by tokugawa ie ##yas ##u . [SEP]
[CLS] the name of the edo period derives from the relocation of the tokugawa regime from its former home in kyoto to the city of edo , present - day tokyo . [SEP]
[CLS] female performers played both men and women in comic play ##lets about ordinary life . [SEP]
[CLS] the style was immediately popular , and ok ##uni was asked to perform before the imperial court . [SEP]
[CLS] in the wake of such success , rival troupe ##s quickly formed , and ka ##bu ##ki was born as ensemble dance and drama performed by women — a form very different from its modern incarnation . [SEP]
[CLS] much of its appeal in this era was due to the rib ##ald , suggest ##ive themes featured by many troupe ##s ; this appeal was further augmented by the fact that the performers were often also available for prostitution . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , ka ##bu ##ki was also called " " ( prostitute - singing and dancing performer ) during this period . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki became a common form of entertainment in the uk ##iy ##o , or yo ##shi ##wara , the registered red - light district in edo . [SEP]
[CLS] a diverse crowd gathered under one roof , something that happened nowhere else in the city . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki theaters were a place to see and be seen as they featured the latest fashion trends and current events . [SEP]
[CLS] the stage provided good entertainment with exciting new music , patterns , clothing , and famous actors . [SEP]
[CLS] performances went from morning until sunset . [SEP]
[CLS] the tea ##houses surrounding or connected to the theater provided meals , ref ##resh ##ments , and good company . [SEP]
[CLS] the area around the theatres was filled with shops selling ka ##bu ##ki so ##uven ##irs . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki , in a sense , initiated pop culture in japan . [SEP]
[CLS] the sho ##gun ##ate was never partial to ka ##bu ##ki and all the mischief it brought , particularly the variety of the social classes which mixed at ka ##bu ##ki performances . [SEP]
[CLS] women ' s ka ##bu ##ki , called on ##na - ka ##bu ##ki , was banned in 1629 for being too erotic . [SEP]
[CLS] following on ##na - ka ##bu ##ki , young boys performed in wa ##kas ##hu - ka ##bu ##ki , but since they too were eligible for prostitution , the sho ##gun government soon banned wa ##kas ##hu - ka ##bu ##ki as well . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki switched to adult male actors , called ya ##ro - ka ##bu ##ki , in the mid - 1600 ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] male actors played both female and male characters . [SEP]
[CLS] the theatre remained popular , and remained a focus of urban lifestyle until modern times . [SEP]
[CLS] although ka ##bu ##ki was performed all over uk ##iy ##o and other portions for the country , the nakamura - za , ich ##im ##ura - za and ka ##wara ##zaki - za theatres became the top theatres in uk ##iy ##o , where some of the most successful ka ##bu ##ki performances were and still are held . [SEP]
[CLS] the modern all - male ka ##bu ##ki , known as " ya ##ro - ka ##bu ##ki " ( young man ka ##bu ##ki ) , was established during these decades . [SEP]
[CLS] after women were banned from performing , cross - dressed male actors , known as " on ##na ##gata " ( " female - role " ) or " o ##yama " , took over . [SEP]
[CLS] young ( adolescent ) men were preferred for women ' s roles due to their less masculine appearance and the higher pitch of their voices compared to adult men . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , " wa ##kas ##hu " ( adolescent male ) roles , played by young men often selected for attractive ##ness , became common , and were often presented in an erotic context . [SEP]
[CLS] along with the change in the performer ' s gender came a change in the emphasis of the performance : increased stress was placed on drama rather than dance . [SEP]
[CLS] performances were equally rib ##ald , and the male actors too were available for prostitution ( to both female and male customers ) . [SEP]
[CLS] audiences frequently became row ##dy , and brawl ##s occasionally broke out , sometimes over the favors of a particularly handsome young actor , leading the sho ##gun ##ate to ban first " on ##na ##gata " and then " wa ##kas ##hu " roles . [SEP]
[CLS] both ban ##s were res ##cin ##ded by 1652 . [SEP]
[CLS] during the gen ##rok ##u era , ka ##bu ##ki thrive ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] the structure of a ka ##bu ##ki play was formal ##ized during this period , as were many elements of style . [SEP]
[CLS] conventional character types were established . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki theater and " ni ##ng ##yo jo ##ru ##ri " , the elaborate form of puppet theater that later came to be known as " bun ##rak ##u " , became closely associated with each other , and each has since influenced the other ' s development . [SEP]
[CLS] the famous playwright chi ##kam ##ats ##u mon ##za ##emon , one of the first professional ka ##bu ##ki playwright ##s , produced several influential works , though the piece usually acknowledged as his most significant , " son ##eza ##ki shin ##ju " ( " the love suicide ##s at son ##eza ##ki " ) , was originally written for bun ##rak ##u . [SEP]
[CLS] like many " bun ##rak ##u " plays , it was adapted for ka ##bu ##ki , and it spawned many im ##ita ##tors — in fact , it and similar plays reportedly caused so many real - life " copy ##cat " suicide ##s that the government banned " shin ##ju mono " ( plays about lovers ' double suicide ##s ) in 1723 . [SEP]
[CLS] ich ##ika ##wa dan ##ju ##ro i also lived during this time ; he is credited with the development of " mi ##e " poses and mask - like ku ##mad ##ori make - up . [SEP]
[CLS] male actors played both female and male characters . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1840s , fires started to affect edo due to repeated drought . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki theatres , traditionally made of wood , were constantly burning down , forcing their relocation within the uk ##iy ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] when the area that housed the nakamura - za was completely destroyed in 1841 , the sho ##gun refused to allow the theatre to be rebuilt , saying that it was against fire code . [SEP]
[CLS] the sho ##gun ##ate did not welcome the mixing and trading that occurred between town merchants and actors , artists , and prostitutes . [SEP]
[CLS] the sho ##gun ##ate took advantage of the fire crisis in 1842 to force the nakamura - za , ich ##im ##ura - za , and ka ##wara ##zaki - za out of the city limits and into asa ##kus ##a , a northern suburb of edo . [SEP]
[CLS] actors , stage ##hand ##s , and others associated with the performances were forced out as well . [SEP]
[CLS] those in areas and lifestyle ##s centered around the theatres also migrated , but the inc ##on ##ven ##ience of the new location reduced attendance . [SEP]
[CLS] these factors , along with strict regulations , pushed much of ka ##bu ##ki " underground " in edo , with performances changing locations to avoid the authorities . [SEP]
[CLS] the theatres ' new location was called sar ##uw ##aka - cho , or sar ##uw ##aka - mach ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] the last thirty years of the tokugawa sho ##gun ##ate ' s rule is often referred to as the sar ##uw ##aka - mach ##i period . [SEP]
[CLS] this period produced some of the ga ##udi ##est ka ##bu ##ki in japanese history . [SEP]
[CLS] the sar ##uw ##aka - mach ##i became the new theatre district for the nakamura - za , ich ##im ##ura - za and ka ##wara ##zaki - za theatres . [SEP]
[CLS] the district was located on the main street of asa ##kus ##a , which ran through the middle of the small city . [SEP]
[CLS] the street was renamed after sar ##uw ##aka kan ##za ##buro , who initiated edo ka ##bu ##ki in the nakamura theatre in 1624 . [SEP]
[CLS] european artists began noticing japanese theatrical performances and artwork , and many artists ( for example , claude mon ##et ) were inspired by japanese wood block prints . [SEP]
[CLS] this western interest prompted japanese artists to increase their depictions of daily life including theatres , brothel ##s , main streets and so on . [SEP]
[CLS] one artist in particular , uta ##gawa hiroshi ##ge , did a series of prints based on sar ##uw ##aka from the sar ##uw ##aka - mach ##i period in asa ##kus ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] the relocation diminished the tradition ' s most abundant inspiration for cost ##uming , make - up , and story line . [SEP]
[CLS] ich ##ika ##wa ko ##dan ##ji iv was one of the most active and successful actors during the sar ##uw ##aka - mach ##i period . [SEP]
[CLS] deemed una ##tt ##ractive , he mainly performed buy ##o , or dancing , in dramas written by ka ##wat ##ake mo ##ku ##ami , who also wrote during the meiji period to follow . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##wat ##ake mo ##ku ##ami commonly wrote plays that depicted the common lives of the people of edo . [SEP]
[CLS] he introduced shi ##chi ##go - cho ( seven - and - five syllable meter ) dialogue and music such as ki ##yo ##moto . [SEP]
[CLS] his ka ##bu ##ki performances became quite popular once the sar ##uw ##aka - mach ##i period ended and theatre returned to edo ; many of his works are still performed . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1868 , the tokugawa sho ##gun ##ate fell apart . [SEP]
[CLS] emperor meiji was restored to power and moved from kyoto to the new capital of edo , or tokyo , beginning the meiji period . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki returned to the uk ##iy ##o of edo . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki became more radical in the meiji period , and modern styles emerged . [SEP]
[CLS] new playwright ##s created new genres and twists on traditional stories . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning in 1868 enormous cultural changes , such as the fall of the tokugawa sho ##gun ##ate , the elimination of the samurai class , and the opening of japan to the west , helped to spark ka ##bu ##ki ' s re - emergence . [SEP]
[CLS] as the culture struggled to adapt to the influx of foreign ideas and influence , actors st ##rove to increase the reputation of ka ##bu ##ki among the upper classes and to adapt the traditional styles to modern tastes . [SEP]
[CLS] they ultimately proved successful in this regard — on 21 april 1887 , the meiji emperor sponsored a performance . [SEP]
[CLS] after world war ii , the occupying forces briefly banned ka ##bu ##ki , which had strongly supported japan ' s war since 1931 ; however , by 1947 the ban had been res ##cin ##ded . [SEP]
[CLS] the immediate post – world war ii era was a difficult time for ka ##bu ##ki . [SEP]
[CLS] besides the war ' s physical devastation , many rejected the styles and thoughts of the past , ka ##bu ##ki among them . [SEP]
[CLS] director te ##tsu ##ji take ##chi ' s popular and innovative productions of ka ##bu ##ki classics at this time are credited with bringing about a rebirth of interest in ka ##bu ##ki in the kan ##sai region . [SEP]
[CLS] of the many popular young stars who performed with the take ##chi ka ##bu ##ki , nakamura gan ##ji ##ro iii ( b . 1931 ) was the leading figure . [SEP]
[CLS] he was first known as nakamura sen ##jak ##u , and this period in osaka ka ##bu ##ki became known as the " age of sen ##jak ##u " in his honor . [SEP]
[CLS] today , ka ##bu ##ki is the most popular of the traditional styles of japanese drama — and its star actors often appear in television or film roles . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the well - known on ##na ##gata band ##o tam ##asa ##buro v has appeared in several ( non - ka ##bu ##ki ) plays and movies , often in a female role . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki appears in works of japanese popular culture such as anime . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to the handful of major theatres in tokyo and kyoto , there are many smaller theatres in osaka and throughout the countryside . [SEP]
[CLS] the os ##hi ##ka ka ##bu ##ki troupe , based in os ##hi ##ka , naga ##no prefecture , is one example . [SEP]
[CLS] some local ka ##bu ##ki troupe ##s today use female actors in on ##na ##gata roles . [SEP]
[CLS] the ich ##ika ##wa sho ##jo ka ##bu ##ki ge ##ki ##dan , an all - female troupe , debuted in 1953 to significant acclaim but failed to start a new trend . [SEP]
[CLS] the introduction of ear ##phone guides in 1975 , including an english version in 1982 , helped broad ##en the art ' s appeal . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , in 1991 the ka ##bu ##ki - za , one of tokyo ' s best known ka ##bu ##ki theaters , began year - round performances and , in 2005 , began marketing ka ##bu ##ki cinema films . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki troupe ##s regularly tour asia , europe and america , and there have been several ka ##bu ##ki - themed productions of canonical western plays such as those of shakespeare . [SEP]
[CLS] western playwright ##s and novelist ##s have experimented with ka ##bu ##ki themes , an example of which is gerald viz ##eno ##r ' s " hiroshima bug ##i " ( 2004 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] writer yuki ##o mis ##hima pioneered and popularized the use of ka ##bu ##ki in modern settings and revived other traditional arts , such as no ##h , adapting them to modern contexts . [SEP]
[CLS] there have even been ka ##bu ##ki troupe ##s established in countries outside japan . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , in australia , the za ka ##bu ##ki troupe at the australian national university has performed a ka ##bu ##ki drama each year since 1976 , the longest regular ka ##bu ##ki performance outside japan . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 2002 a statue was erected in honor of ka ##bu ##ki ' s founder ok ##uni and to commemorate 400 years of ka ##bu ##ki ' s existence . [SEP]
[CLS] diagonal ##ly across from the mina ##mi - za , the last remaining ka ##bu ##ki theater in kyoto , it stands at the east end of a bridge ( shi ##jo oh ##ashi ) crossing the kam ##o river in kyoto . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki was inscribed on the unesco int ##ang ##ible cultural heritage lists in 2005 . [SEP]
[CLS] the ka ##bu ##ki stage features a projection called a " hana ##mic ##hi " ( , " flower path " ) , a walkway which extends into the audience and via which dramatic entrances and exits are made . [SEP]
[CLS] ok ##uni also performed on a hana ##mic ##hi stage with her entourage . [SEP]
[CLS] the stage is used not only as a walkway or path to get to and from the main stage , but important scenes are also played on the stage . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki stages and theaters have steadily become more technological ##ly sophisticated , and innovations including revolving stages and trap doors were introduced during the 18th century . [SEP]
[CLS] a driving force has been the desire to manifest one frequent theme of ka ##bu ##ki theater , that of the sudden , dramatic revelation or transformation . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of stage tricks , including actors ' rapid appearance and disappearance , employ these innovations . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " ke ##ren " , often translated " playing to the gallery " , is sometimes used as a catch - all for these tricks . [SEP]
[CLS] hana ##mic ##hi and several innovations including revolving stage , " ser ##i " and " chun ##ori " have all contributed to ka ##bu ##ki play . [SEP]
[CLS] " hana ##mic ##hi " creates depth and both " ser ##i " and " chun ##ori " provide a vertical dimension . [SEP]
[CLS] " ma ##wari - but ##ai " ( revolving stage ) developed in the ky ##oh ##o era ( 1716 – 1735 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the trick was originally accomplished by the on - stage pushing of a round , wheeled platform . [SEP]
[CLS] later a circular platform was embedded in the stage with wheels beneath it facilitating movement . [SEP]
[CLS] the " ku ##rate ##n " ( “ darkened rev ##ol ##ve ” ) technique involves lowering the stage lights during this transition . [SEP]
[CLS] more commonly the lights are left on for " aka ##ten " ( “ lighted rev ##ol ##ve ” ) , sometimes simultaneously performing the transition ##ing scenes for dramatic effect . [SEP]
[CLS] this stage was first built in japan in the early eighteenth century . [SEP]
[CLS] " ser ##i " refers to the stage " traps " that have been commonly employed in ka ##bu ##ki since the middle of the 18th century . [SEP]
[CLS] these traps raise and lower actors or sets to the stage . [SEP]
[CLS] " ser ##ida ##shi " or " ser ##ia ##ge " refers to trap ( s ) moving upward and " ser ##isa ##ge " or " ser ##ior ##oshi " to traps descending . [SEP]
[CLS] this technique is often used to lift an entire scene at once . [SEP]
[CLS] " chun ##ori " ( riding in mid - air ) is a technique , which appeared toward the middle of the 19th century , by which an actor ' s costume is attached to wires and he is made to " fly " over the stage and / or certain parts of the auditorium . [SEP]
[CLS] this is similar to the wire trick in the stage musical " peter pan " , in which peter launches himself into the air . [SEP]
[CLS] it is still one of the most popular " ke ##ren " ( visual tricks ) in ka ##bu ##ki today ; major ka ##bu ##ki theaters , such as the national theatre , ka ##bu ##ki - za and mina ##mi - za , are all equipped with chun ##ori installations . [SEP]
[CLS] scenery changes are sometimes made mid - scene , while the actors remain on stage and the curtain stays open . [SEP]
[CLS] this is sometimes accomplished by using a " hi ##ki dog ##u " , or " small wagon stage " . [SEP]
[CLS] this technique originated at the beginning of the 18th century , where scenery or actors move on or off stage on a wheeled platform . [SEP]
[CLS] also common are stage ##hand ##s rushing onto the stage adding and removing props , backdrop ##s and other scenery ; these " ku ##rok ##o " are always dressed entirely in black and are traditionally considered invisible . [SEP]
[CLS] stage ##hand ##s also assist in a variety of quick costume changes known as " hay ##agawa ##ri " ( " quick change technique " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when a character ' s true nature is suddenly revealed , the devices of " hi ##kin ##uki " and " bu ##kka ##eri " are often used . [SEP]
[CLS] this involves layer ##ing one costume over another and having a stage ##hand pull the outer one off in front of the audience . [SEP]
[CLS] the curtain that shields the stage before the performance and during the breaks is in the traditional colours of black , red and green , in various order , or white instead of green , vertical stripes . [SEP]
[CLS] the curtain consists of one piece and is pulled back to one side by a staff member by hand . [SEP]
[CLS] an additional outer curtain called " don ##cho " was not introduced until the meiji era following the introduction of western influence . [SEP]
[CLS] these are more ornate in their appearance and are woven . [SEP]
[CLS] they depict the season in which the performance is taking place , often designed by renowned ni ##hong ##a artists . [SEP]
[CLS] the three main categories of ka ##bu ##ki play are " ji ##dai ##mon ##o " ( , " historical " , or pre - sen ##go ##ku period stories ) , " se ##wa ##mon ##o " ( , " domestic " , or post - sen ##go ##ku stories ) and " sho ##sa ##go ##to " ( , " dance pieces " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] " ji ##dai ##mon ##o " , or history plays , were set within the context of major events in japanese history . [SEP]
[CLS] strict censorship laws during the edo period prohibited the representation of contemporary events and particularly prohibited critic ##ising the sho ##gun ##ate or casting it in a bad light , although enforcement varied greatly over the years . [SEP]
[CLS] many shows were set in the context of the gen ##pe ##i war of the 118 ##0s , the nan ##bo ##ku - cho wars of the 133 ##0s , or other historical events . [SEP]
[CLS] frustrating the ce ##nsor ##s , many shows used these historical settings as metaphor ##s for contemporary events . [SEP]
[CLS] " kan ##ade ##hon chu ##shing ##ura " , one of the most famous plays in the ka ##bu ##ki repertoire , serves as an excellent example ; it is ostensibly set in the 133 ##0s , though it actually depicts the contemporary ( 18th century ) affair of the revenge of the 47 " ronin " . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike " ji ##dai ##mon ##o " which generally focused upon the samurai class , " se ##wa ##mon ##o " focused primarily upon common ##ers , namely townspeople and peasants . [SEP]
[CLS] often referred to as " domestic plays " in english , " se ##wa ##mon ##o " generally related to themes of family drama and romance . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the most famous " se ##wa ##mon ##o " are the love suicide plays , adapted from works by the " bun ##rak ##u " playwright chi ##kam ##ats ##u ; these center on romantic couples who cannot be together in life due to various circumstances and who therefore decide to be together in death instead . [SEP]
[CLS] many if not most " se ##wa ##mon ##o " contain significant elements of this theme of societal pressures and limitations . [SEP]
[CLS] important elements of ka ##bu ##ki include the " mi ##e " , in which the actor holds a picturesque pose to establish his character . [SEP]
[CLS] at this point his house name ( " ya ##go " , ) is sometimes heard in loud shout ( " ka ##ke ##go ##e " , ) from an expert audience member , serving both to express and enhance the audience ' s appreciation of the actor ' s achievement . [SEP]
[CLS] an even greater compliment can be paid by shouting the name of the actor ' s father . [SEP]
[CLS] the main actor has to convey a wide variety of emotions between a fallen , drunk ##ard person and someone who in reality is quite different since he is only fa ##king his weakness , for example in the character of yu ##rano ##suke in " chu ##shing ##ura " . [SEP]
[CLS] this is called " hara - ge ##i " or " belly acting " , which means he has to perform from within to change characters . [SEP]
[CLS] it is technically difficult to perform and takes a long time to learn , but once mastered the audience takes up on the actor ' s emotion . [SEP]
[CLS] emotions are also expressed through the colours of the costumes , a key element in ka ##bu ##ki . [SEP]
[CLS] ga ##udy and strong colours can convey foolish or joy ##ful emotions , whereas severe or muted colours convey seriousness and focus . [SEP]
[CLS] " ke ##sho " , ka ##bu ##ki makeup , provides an element of style easily recognizable even by those unfamiliar with the art form . [SEP]
[CLS] rice powder is used to create the white " os ##hiro ##i " base for the characteristic stage makeup , and " ku ##mad ##ori " enhance ##s or ex ##agger ##ates facial lines to produce dramatic animal or supernatural masks . [SEP]
[CLS] the color of the " ku ##mad ##ori " is an expression of the character ' s nature : red lines are used to indicate passion , heroism , righteous ##ness , and other positive traits ; blue or black , villain ##y , jealousy , and other negative traits ; green , the supernatural ; and purple , nobility . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki , like other traditional forms of drama in japan and other cultures , was ( and sometimes still is ) performed in full - day programs . [SEP]
[CLS] rather than attending for 2 – 5 hours , as one might do in a modern western - style theater , audiences " escape " from the day - to - day world , dev ##oting a full day to entertainment . [SEP]
[CLS] though some individual plays , particularly the historical " ji ##dai ##mon ##o " , might last an entire day , most were shorter and sequence ##d with other plays in order to produce a full - day program . [SEP]
[CLS] the structure of the full - day program , like the structure of the plays themselves , was derived largely from the conventions of " bun ##rak ##u " and " no ##h " , conventions which also appear in other traditional japanese arts . [SEP]
[CLS] chief among these is the concept of " jo - ha - ky ##u " , which states that dramatic pacing should start slow , speed up , and end quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] the concept , elaborated on at length by master no ##h playwright ze ##ami , govern ##s not only the actions of the actors , but also the structure of the play as well as the structure of scenes and plays within a day - long program . [SEP]
[CLS] nearly every full - length play occupies five acts . [SEP]
[CLS] the first corresponds to " jo " , an aus ##pic ##ious and slow opening which introduces the audience to the characters and the plot . [SEP]
[CLS] the next three acts correspond to " ha " , speeding events up , culminating almost always in a great moment of drama or tragedy in the third act and possibly a battle in the second and / or fourth acts . [SEP]
[CLS] the final act , corresponding to " ky ##u " , is almost always short , providing a quick and satisfying conclusion . [SEP]
[CLS] while many plays were originally written for ka ##bu ##ki , many others were taken from " jo ##ru ##ri " plays , no ##h plays , folklore , or other performing traditions such as the oral tradition of the " tale of the he ##ike " . [SEP]
[CLS] while " jo ##ru ##ri " plays tend to have serious , emotionally dramatic , and organized plots , plays written specifically for ka ##bu ##ki generally have loose ##r , si ##llie ##r plots . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the crucial differences in the philosophy of the two forms is that " jo ##ru ##ri " focuses primarily on the story and on the chant ##er who rec ##ites it , while ka ##bu ##ki focuses more on the actors . [SEP]
[CLS] a " jo ##ru ##ri " play may sacrifice the details of sets , puppets , or action in favor of the chant ##er , while ka ##bu ##ki is known to sacrifice drama and even the plot to highlight an actor ' s talents . [SEP]
[CLS] it was not uncommon in ka ##bu ##ki to insert or remove individual scenes from a day ' s schedule in order to cater to the talents or desires of an individual actor — scenes he was famed for , or that featured him , would be inserted into a program without regard to plot continuity . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##bu ##ki traditions in edo and in kam ##iga ##ta ( the kyoto - osaka region ) were quite different . [SEP]
[CLS] through most of the edo period , ka ##bu ##ki in edo was defined by extra ##va ##gan ##ce and bomb ##ast , as exemplified by stark makeup patterns , flash ##y costumes , fancy " ke ##ren " ( " stage tricks " ) , and bold " mi ##e " ( " poses " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] kam ##iga ##ta ka ##bu ##ki , meanwhile , was much calm ##er and focused on natural ##ism and realism in acting . [SEP]
[CLS] only towards the end of the edo period in the 19th century did the two regions adopt one another ' s styles to any significant degree . [SEP]
[CLS] for a long time , actors from one region often failed to adjust to the styles of the other region and were unsuccessful in their performance tours of that region . [SEP]
[CLS] actors form schools or are associated with a particular theatre . [SEP]
[CLS] every actor has a stage name , which is different from the name they were born with . [SEP]
[CLS] these stage ##name ##s , most often those of the actor ' s father , grandfather , or teacher , are passed down between generations of actors ' lineage ##s , and hold great honor and importance . [SEP]
[CLS] many names are associated with certain roles or acting styles , and the new possess ##or of each name must live up to these expectations ; there is the feeling almost of the actor not only taking a name , but em ##body ##ing the spirit , style , or skill of each actor to previously hold that name . [SEP]
[CLS] many actors will go through at least three names over the course of their career . [SEP]
[CLS] the " shu ##mei " ( , lit . [SEP]
[CLS] name succession ) are grand naming ceremonies held in ka ##bu ##ki theatre in front of the audience . [SEP]
[CLS] most often , a number of actors will participate in a single ceremony , taking on new stage - names . [SEP]
[CLS] their participation in a " shu ##mei " represent their passage into a new chapter of their performing career . [SEP]
