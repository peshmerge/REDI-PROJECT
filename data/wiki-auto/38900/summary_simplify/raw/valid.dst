In the performing arts, a scenario ( , ; from Italian: "that which is pinned to the scenery", ] ) is a synoptical collage of an event or series of actions and events.
In the "commedia dell'arte" it was an outline of entrances, exits, and action describing the plot of a play, and was literally pinned to the back of the scenery.
Surviving scenarios from the Renaissance contain little other than character names, brief descriptions of action, and references to specific lazzi with no further explanation.
Modern commedia troupes most often make use of a script with varying degrees of additional improvisation.
In the creation of an opera or ballet, a scenario is often developed initially to indicate how the original source, if any, is to be adapted and to summarize the aspects of character, staging, plot, etc.
