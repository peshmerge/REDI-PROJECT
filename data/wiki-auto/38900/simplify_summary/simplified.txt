in the performing arts , a scenario is used to describe something that is pinned to the scenery .
in the " commedia dell ' arte " it was an outline of entrances , exits , and action describing the plot of a play .
it is also known as " canovaccio " or " that is pinned to the canvas " of which the scenery was constructed .
surviving scenarios from the renaissance contain little other than character names , brief descriptions of action , and references to specific lazzi with no further explanation .
it is believed that a scenario formed the basis for a fully improvisational performance .
commedia troupes often use a script with varying degrees of additional improvisation .
in the creation of an opera or ballet , a scenario is often developed initially to indicate how the original source , if any , is to be adapted and to summarize the aspects of character , staging , plot , etc . that can be expanded later in a fully developed libretto , or script .
this sketch can be helpful in " pitching " the idea to a prospective producer , director or composer .
