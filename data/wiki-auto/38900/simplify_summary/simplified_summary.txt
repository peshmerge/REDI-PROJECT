in the performing arts , a scenario is used to describe something that is pinned to the scenery .
in the " commedia dell ' arte " it was an outline of entrances , exits , and action describing the plot of a play .
commedia troupes often use a script with varying degrees of additional improvisation .
in the creation of an opera or ballet , a scenario is often developed initially to indicate how the original source , if any , is to be adapted and to summarize the aspects of character , staging , plot , etc .
this sketch can be helpful in " pitching " the idea to a prospective producer , director or composer .
