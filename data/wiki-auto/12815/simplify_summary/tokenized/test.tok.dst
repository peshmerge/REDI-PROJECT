[CLS] the flag of greenland was designed by greenland native th ##ue christians ##en . [SEP]
[CLS] it features two equal horizontal bands of white ( top ) and red with a large disk slightly to the ho ##ist side of centre . [SEP]
[CLS] the top half of the disk is red , the bottom half is white . [SEP]
[CLS] the top half of the flag bears a slight resemblance to the flag of japan as a result . [SEP]
[CLS] the entire flag measures 18 by 12 parts ; each stripe measures 6 parts ; the disk is 8 parts in dia ##met ##re , horizontally offset by 7 parts from the ho ##ist to the centre of the circle , and vertically centered . [SEP]
[CLS] its local name in the greenland ##ic language is " er ##fa ##las ##or ##put " , which means " our flag " . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " aa ##ppa ##la ##art ##o ##q " ( meaning " the red " ) is also used for both the greenland ##ic flag and the flag of denmark ( " dan ##ne ##bro ##g " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] today , greenland ##ers display both the " er ##fa ##las ##or ##put " and the " dan ##ne ##bro ##g " â€” often side - by - side . [SEP]
[CLS] the flag of greenland is the only national flag of a nordic country or territory without a nordic cross . [SEP]
[CLS] greenland first entertained the idea of a flag of its own in 1973 when five greenland ##ers proposed a green , white and blue flag . [SEP]
[CLS] the following year , a newspaper sol ##ici ##ted eleven design proposals ( all but one of which was a nordic cross ) and polled the people to determine the most popular . [SEP]
[CLS] the flag of denmark was preferred to the others . [SEP]
[CLS] little came of this effort . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1978 , denmark granted home rule to greenland , making it an equal member of the " danish realm " . [SEP]
[CLS] the home rule government held an official call for flag proposals , receiving 555 ( of which 293 were submitted by greenland ##ers ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the deciding committee came to no consensus , so more proposals were sol ##ici ##ted . [SEP]
[CLS] finally the present red - and - white design by christians ##en narrowly won over a green - and - white nordic cross by a vote of fourteen to eleven . [SEP]
[CLS] christians ##en ' s red - and - white flag was officially adopted on 21 june 1985 . [SEP]
[CLS] to honour the tenth anniversary of the " er ##fa ##las ##or ##put " , the greenland post office issued commemorative postage stamps and a leaf ##let by the flag ' s creator . [SEP]
[CLS] he described the white stripe as representing the glaciers and ice cap , which cover more than 80 % of the island ; the red stripe , the ocean ; the red semi ##ci ##rcle , the sun , with its bottom part sunk in the ocean ; and the white semi ##ci ##rcle , the ice ##berg ##s and pack ice . [SEP]
[CLS] the design is also reminiscent of the setting sun half - submerged below the horizon and reflected on the sea . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1985 , the public was made aware that greenland ' s flag had exactly the same motif as the flag of the danish rowing club he ##i ro ##sport , which was founded before greenland ' s flag was chosen . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not clear whether this is a case of pl ##agi ##aris ##m or just a coincidence , but the rowing club has given greenland permission to use their flag . [SEP]
[CLS] the colours of the " er ##fa ##las ##or ##put " are the same as those of the " dan ##ne ##bro ##g " , symbol ##izing greenland ' s place in the danish realm . [SEP]
