its local name in the greenlandic language is erfalasorput , which means " our flag " .
greenland first entertained the idea of a flag of its own in 1973 .
the following year , a newspaper solicited eleven design proposals .
the flag of denmark was chosen from the flag of denmark .
in 1978 , denmark granted home rule to greenland , making it an equal member of the danish kingdom .
the home rule government had an official call for flag proposals , receiving 555 å¿  of which 293 were submitted by greenlanders reeling .
christiansen 's flag was adopted on june 21,1985 .
the greenland post office issued commemorative postage stamps and a leaflet by the flag 's creator .
he described the white stripe as representing the glaciers and ice cap , which cover more than 80 % of the island ; the red stripe , the ocean ; the red semicircle , the sun , with its bottom part sunk in the ocean ; and the white semicircle , the icebergs and pack ice .
the design is also reminiscent of the setting sun half-submerged below the horizon and reflected on the sea .
in 1985 , the public was made aware that greenland 's flag had exactly the same motif as the flag of the danish rowing club hei rosport .
it is not clear whether this is a case of plagiarism or just a coincidence .
the colours of the erfalasorput are the same as those of the dannebrog , symbolizing greenland 's place in the danish realm .
