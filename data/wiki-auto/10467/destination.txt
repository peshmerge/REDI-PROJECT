Emperor Ankan (安閑天皇, Ankan-tennō) was the 27th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Ankan to be possibly legendary, but probable.
The name Ankan"-tennō" was created for him posthumously by later generations.
No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign.
The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.
According to "Kojiki" Ankan was the elder son of Emperor Keitai.
Ankan died childless, and the throne passed to his brother, who would become known as Emperor Senka.
Very little is known about the events of Ankan's life and reign.
Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.
Ankan attained the Imperial throne when his father, Emperor Keitai, abdicated in his favor.
The construction of state granaries in large numbers throughout Japan was a demonstration of the broad reach of Imperial power and concerns.
His death ended his reign after only four years.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Ankan.
According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun").
Ankan is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.
