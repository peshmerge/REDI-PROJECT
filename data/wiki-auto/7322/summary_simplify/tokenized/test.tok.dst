[CLS] they are all stories with a plot and characters who are either deities , human - like figures , or animals , who often speak and transform easily . [SEP]
[CLS] they are often set in a dim and non ##sp ##ec ##ific past that historian of religion mir ##cea eli ##ade termed " in ill ##o tempo ##re " ( ' at that time ' ) . [SEP]
[CLS] creation myths address questions deeply meaningful to the society that shares them , revealing their central world ##view and the framework for the self - identity of the culture and individual in a universal context . [SEP]
[CLS] myth na ##rra ##tes a sacred history ; it relates an event that took place in pri ##mo ##rdial time , the fable ##d time of the " beginnings . " [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , myth tells how , through the deeds of supernatural beings , a reality came into existence , be it the whole of reality , the cosmos , or only a fragment of reality – an island , a species of plant , a particular kind of human behavior , an institution . [SEP]
[CLS] all creation myths are in one sense et ##iol ##ogical because they attempt to explain how the world was formed and where humanity came from . [SEP]
[CLS] et ##hn ##ologists and anthropologist ##s who study these myths say that in the modern context theologians try to disc ##ern humanity ' s meaning from revealed truths and scientists investigate co ##smo ##logy with the tools of em ##pi ##ric ##ism and rational ##ity , but creation myths define human reality in very different terms . [SEP]
[CLS] in the past historians of religion and other students of myth thought of them as forms of primitive or early - stage science or religion and analyzed them in a literal or logical sense . [SEP]
[CLS] today , however , they are seen as symbolic narratives which must be understood in terms of their own cultural context . [SEP]
[CLS] charles long writes , " the beings referred to in the myth – gods , animals , plants – are forms of power grasped existent ##ial ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] while creation myths are not literal ex ##plication ##s they do serve to define an orientation of humanity in the world in terms of a birth story . [SEP]
[CLS] in this sense they serve as a philosophy of life but one expressed and conveyed through symbol rather than systematic reason . [SEP]
[CLS] and in this sense they go beyond et ##iol ##ogical myths which mean to explain specific features in religious rites , natural phenomena or cultural life . [SEP]
[CLS] creation myths also help to orient human beings in the world , giving them a sense of their place in the world and the regard that they must have for humans and nature . [SEP]
[CLS] there are no entirely satisfactory solutions to this dilemma . [SEP]
[CLS] eli ##ade and his colleague charles long developed a classification based on some common motifs that re ##app ##ear in stories the world over . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea that god created the world out of nothing – " ex ni ##hil ##o " – is central today to judaism , christianity and islam , and the medieval jewish philosopher mai ##mon ##ides felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared . [SEP]
[CLS] the authors of genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter ( the material which god formed into the habit ##able cosmos ) , but with assign ##ing roles so that the cosmos should function . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 2nd century ad , early christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world - formation and the om ##ni ##pot ##ence of god , and by the beginning of the 3rd century creation " ex ni ##hil ##o " had become a fundamental ten ##et of christian theology . [SEP]
[CLS] the debate between sheep and grain is an example of an even earlier form of " ex ni ##hil ##o " creation myth from ancient sum ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] in most of these stories the world is brought into being by the speech , dream , breath , or pure thought of a creator but creation ex ni ##hil ##o may also take place through a creator ' s bodily secret ##ions . [SEP]
[CLS] the literal translation of the phrase " ex ni ##hil ##o " is " from nothing " but in many creation myths the line is blurred whether the creative act would be better classified as a creation " ex ni ##hil ##o " or creation from chaos . [SEP]
[CLS] in " ex ni ##hil ##o " creation myths the potential and the substance of creation springs from within the creator . [SEP]
[CLS] such a creator may or may not be existing in physical surroundings such as darkness or water , but does not create the world from them , whereas in creation from chaos the substance used for creation is pre - existing within the un ##formed void . [SEP]
[CLS] in creation from chaos myth , initially there is nothing but a form ##less , shape ##less expanse . [SEP]
[CLS] chaos may be described as having the consistency of vapor or water , dimension ##less , and sometimes salty or muddy . [SEP]
[CLS] the act of creation is the bringing of order from disorder , and in many of these cultures it is believed that at some point the forces preserving order and form will weaken and the world will once again be engulfed into the abyss . [SEP]
[CLS] one form describes the prime ##val state as an eternal union of two parents , and the creation takes place when the two are pulled apart . [SEP]
[CLS] the two parents are commonly identified as sky ( usually male ) and earth ( usually female ) who in the prime ##val state were so tightly bound to each other that no offspring could emerge . [SEP]
[CLS] these myths often depict creation as the result of a sexual union , and serve as genealogical record of the deities born from it . [SEP]
[CLS] often in these stories the limbs , hair , blood , bones or organs of the prime ##val being are somehow severed or sacrificed to transform into sky , earth , animal or plant life , and other world ##ly features . [SEP]
[CLS] these myths tend to emphasize creative forces as an ##imi ##stic in nature rather than sexual , and depict the sacred as the elemental and integral component of the natural world . [SEP]
[CLS] one example of this is the norse creation myth described in " g ##yl ##fa ##gin ##ning " exactly in the poem vol ##us ##pa . [SEP]
[CLS] the previous world is often considered the womb of the earth mother , and the process of emergence is likened to the act of giving birth . [SEP]
[CLS] male characters rarely figure into these stories , and scholars often consider them in counter ##point to male - oriented creation myths , like those of the " ex ni ##hil ##o " variety . [SEP]
[CLS] the genre is most commonly found in native american cultures where the myths frequently link the final emergence of people from a hole opening to the underworld to stories about their subsequent migration ##s and eventual settlement in their current homeland ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the pattern of distribution of these stories suggest they have a common origin in the eastern asiatic coastal region , spreading as peoples migrated west into siberia and east to the north american continent . [SEP]
[CLS] characteristic of many native american myths , earth - diver creation stories begin as beings and potential forms linger asleep or suspended in the pri ##mo ##rdial realm . [SEP]
[CLS] the earth - diver is among the first of them to awake ##n and lay the necessary ground ##work by building suitable lands where the coming creation will be able to live . [SEP]
