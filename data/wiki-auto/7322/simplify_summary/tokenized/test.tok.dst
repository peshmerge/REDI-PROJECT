[CLS] a creation myth ( or co ##smo ##gon ##ic myth ) is a symbolic narrative of how the world began and how people first came to inhabit it . [SEP]
[CLS] while in popular usage the term " myth " often refers to false or fan ##ciful stories , members of cultures often as ##cr ##ibe varying degrees of truth to their creation myths . [SEP]
[CLS] in the society in which it is told , a creation myth is usually regarded as convey ##ing profound truths , metaphor ##ically , symbolic ##ally and sometimes in a historical or literal sense . [SEP]
[CLS] they are commonly , although not always , considered co ##smo ##gon ##ical myths — that is , they describe the ordering of the cosmos from a state of chaos or amor ##ph ##ous ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] creation myths often share a number of features . [SEP]
[CLS] they often are considered sacred accounts and can be found in nearly all known religious traditions . [SEP]
[CLS] they are all stories with a plot and characters who are either deities , human - like figures , or animals , who often speak and transform easily . [SEP]
[CLS] they are often set in a dim and non ##sp ##ec ##ific past that historian of religion mir ##cea eli ##ade termed " in ill ##o tempo ##re " ( ' at that time ' ) . [SEP]
[CLS] creation myths address questions deeply meaningful to the society that shares them , revealing their central world ##view and the framework for the self - identity of the culture and individual in a universal context . [SEP]
[CLS] creation myths develop in oral traditions and therefore typically have multiple versions ; found throughout human culture , they are the most common form of myth . [SEP]
[CLS] myth na ##rra ##tes a sacred history ; it relates an event that took place in pri ##mo ##rdial time , the fable ##d time of the " beginnings . " [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , myth tells how , through the deeds of supernatural beings , a reality came into existence , be it the whole of reality , the cosmos , or only a fragment of reality – an island , a species of plant , a particular kind of human behavior , an institution . [SEP]
[CLS] all creation myths are in one sense et ##iol ##ogical because they attempt to explain how the world was formed and where humanity came from . [SEP]
[CLS] myths attempt to explain the unknown and sometimes teach a lesson . [SEP]
[CLS] et ##hn ##ologists and anthropologist ##s who study these myths say that in the modern context theologians try to disc ##ern humanity ' s meaning from revealed truths and scientists investigate co ##smo ##logy with the tools of em ##pi ##ric ##ism and rational ##ity , but creation myths define human reality in very different terms . [SEP]
[CLS] in the past historians of religion and other students of myth thought of them as forms of primitive or early - stage science or religion and analyzed them in a literal or logical sense . [SEP]
[CLS] today , however , they are seen as symbolic narratives which must be understood in terms of their own cultural context . [SEP]
[CLS] charles long writes , " the beings referred to in the myth – gods , animals , plants – are forms of power grasped existent ##ial ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] the myths should not be understood as attempts to work out a rational explanation of deity . " [SEP]
[CLS] while creation myths are not literal ex ##plication ##s they do serve to define an orientation of humanity in the world in terms of a birth story . [SEP]
[CLS] they are the basis of a world ##view that re ##af ##firm ##s and guides how people relate to the natural world , to any assumed spiritual world , and to each other . [SEP]
[CLS] the creation myth acts as a cornerstone for distinguishing primary reality from relative reality , the origin and nature of being from non - being . [SEP]
[CLS] in this sense they serve as a philosophy of life but one expressed and conveyed through symbol rather than systematic reason . [SEP]
[CLS] and in this sense they go beyond et ##iol ##ogical myths which mean to explain specific features in religious rites , natural phenomena or cultural life . [SEP]
[CLS] creation myths also help to orient human beings in the world , giving them a sense of their place in the world and the regard that they must have for humans and nature . [SEP]
[CLS] each beginning seems to pre ##su ##pp ##ose an earlier beginning . [SEP]
[CLS] . . . instead of meeting a single starting point , we encounter an infinity of them , each of which poses the same problem . [SEP]
[CLS] . . . there are no entirely satisfactory solutions to this dilemma . [SEP]
[CLS] what we have to find is not a solution but some way of dealing with the mystery . . . and we have to do so using words . [SEP]
[CLS] the words we reach for , from " god " to " gravity " , are inadequate to the task . [SEP]
[CLS] so we have to use language poetic ##ally or symbolic ##ally ; and such language , whether used by a scientist , a poet , or a shaman , can easily be misunderstood . [SEP]
[CLS] myth ##ologists have applied various schemes to classify creation myths found throughout human cultures . [SEP]
[CLS] eli ##ade and his colleague charles long developed a classification based on some common motifs that re ##app ##ear in stories the world over . [SEP]
[CLS] marta wei ##gle further developed and refined this ty ##pol ##ogy to highlight nine themes , adding elements such as " de ##us faber " , a creation crafted by a deity , creation from the work of two creators working together or against each other , creation from sacrifice and creation from division / con ##ju ##gation , acc ##ret ##ion / conjunction , or secret ##ion . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea that god created the world out of nothing – " ex ni ##hil ##o " – is central today to judaism , christianity and islam , and the medieval jewish philosopher mai ##mon ##ides felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , the concept is not found in the entire hebrew bible . [SEP]
[CLS] the authors of genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter ( the material which god formed into the habit ##able cosmos ) , but with assign ##ing roles so that the cosmos should function . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 2nd century ad , early christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world - formation and the om ##ni ##pot ##ence of god , and by the beginning of the 3rd century creation " ex ni ##hil ##o " had become a fundamental ten ##et of christian theology . [SEP]
[CLS] " ex ni ##hil ##o " creation is found in creation stories from ancient egypt , the rig ve ##da , and many an ##imi ##stic cultures in africa , asia , oceania and north america . [SEP]
[CLS] the debate between sheep and grain is an example of an even earlier form of " ex ni ##hil ##o " creation myth from ancient sum ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] in most of these stories the world is brought into being by the speech , dream , breath , or pure thought of a creator but creation ex ni ##hil ##o may also take place through a creator ' s bodily secret ##ions . [SEP]
[CLS] the literal translation of the phrase " ex ni ##hil ##o " is " from nothing " but in many creation myths the line is blurred whether the creative act would be better classified as a creation " ex ni ##hil ##o " or creation from chaos . [SEP]
[CLS] in " ex ni ##hil ##o " creation myths the potential and the substance of creation springs from within the creator . [SEP]
[CLS] such a creator may or may not be existing in physical surroundings such as darkness or water , but does not create the world from them , whereas in creation from chaos the substance used for creation is pre - existing within the un ##formed void . [SEP]
[CLS] in creation from chaos myth , initially there is nothing but a form ##less , shape ##less expanse . [SEP]
[CLS] in these stories the word " chaos " means " disorder " , and this form ##less expanse , which is also sometimes called a void or an abyss , contains the material with which the created world will be made . [SEP]
[CLS] chaos may be described as having the consistency of vapor or water , dimension ##less , and sometimes salty or muddy . [SEP]
[CLS] these myths associate chaos with evil and oblivion , in contrast to " order " ( " cosmos " ) which is the good . [SEP]
[CLS] the act of creation is the bringing of order from disorder , and in many of these cultures it is believed that at some point the forces preserving order and form will weaken and the world will once again be engulfed into the abyss . [SEP]
[CLS] one example is the genesis creation myth from the first chapter of the book of genesis . [SEP]
[CLS] there are two types of world parent myths , both describing a separation or splitting of a prime ##val entity , the world parent or parents . [SEP]
[CLS] one form describes the prime ##val state as an eternal union of two parents , and the creation takes place when the two are pulled apart . [SEP]
[CLS] the two parents are commonly identified as sky ( usually male ) and earth ( usually female ) who in the prime ##val state were so tightly bound to each other that no offspring could emerge . [SEP]
[CLS] these myths often depict creation as the result of a sexual union , and serve as genealogical record of the deities born from it . [SEP]
[CLS] in the second form of world parent myth , creation itself springs from di ##sm ##em ##bered parts of the body of the prime ##val being . [SEP]
[CLS] often in these stories the limbs , hair , blood , bones or organs of the prime ##val being are somehow severed or sacrificed to transform into sky , earth , animal or plant life , and other world ##ly features . [SEP]
[CLS] these myths tend to emphasize creative forces as an ##imi ##stic in nature rather than sexual , and depict the sacred as the elemental and integral component of the natural world . [SEP]
[CLS] one example of this is the norse creation myth described in " g ##yl ##fa ##gin ##ning " exactly in the poem vol ##us ##pa . [SEP]
[CLS] in emergence myths humanity emerges from another world into the one they currently inhabit . [SEP]
[CLS] the previous world is often considered the womb of the earth mother , and the process of emergence is likened to the act of giving birth . [SEP]
[CLS] the role of mid ##wife is usually played by a female deity , like the spider woman of several myth ##ologies of indigenous peoples in the americas . [SEP]
[CLS] male characters rarely figure into these stories , and scholars often consider them in counter ##point to male - oriented creation myths , like those of the " ex ni ##hil ##o " variety . [SEP]
[CLS] emergence myths commonly describe the creation of people and / or supernatural beings as a staged ascent or meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis from nas ##cent forms through a series of subterranean worlds to arrive at their current place and form . [SEP]
[CLS] often the passage from one world or stage to the next is imp ##elled by inner forces , a process of ge ##rmin ##ation or ge ##station from earlier , embryo ##nic forms . [SEP]
[CLS] the genre is most commonly found in native american cultures where the myths frequently link the final emergence of people from a hole opening to the underworld to stories about their subsequent migration ##s and eventual settlement in their current homeland ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the earth - diver is a common character in various traditional creation myths . [SEP]
[CLS] in these stories a supreme being usually sends an animal into the primal waters to find bits of sand or mud with which to build habit ##able land . [SEP]
[CLS] some scholars interpret these myths psychological ##ly while others interpret them co ##smo ##gon ##ically . [SEP]
[CLS] in both cases emphasis is placed on beginnings em ##ana ##ting from the depths . [SEP]
[CLS] earth - diver myths are common in native american folklore but can be found among the chu ##k ##chi and yu ##ka ##ghi ##r , the tatar ##s and many finn ##o - u ##gr ##ian traditions . [SEP]
[CLS] the pattern of distribution of these stories suggest they have a common origin in the eastern asiatic coastal region , spreading as peoples migrated west into siberia and east to the north american continent . [SEP]
[CLS] characteristic of many native american myths , earth - diver creation stories begin as beings and potential forms linger asleep or suspended in the pri ##mo ##rdial realm . [SEP]
[CLS] the earth - diver is among the first of them to awake ##n and lay the necessary ground ##work by building suitable lands where the coming creation will be able to live . [SEP]
[CLS] in many cases , these stories will describe a series of failed attempts to make land before the solution is found . [SEP]
