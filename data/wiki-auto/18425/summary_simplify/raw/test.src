During his lifetime, Sacher-Masoch was well known as a man of letters, in particular a utopian thinker who espoused socialist and humanist ideals in his fiction and non-fiction.
Until recently, his novel "Venus in Furs" was his only book commonly available in English, but an English translation by William Holmes of "Die Gottesmutter" was released in 2015 as "The Mother of God".
Von Sacher-Masoch was born in the city of Lemberg (now Lviv, Ukraine), the capital of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, at the time a province of the Austrian Empire, into the Roman Catholic family of an Austrian civil servant, Leopold Johann Nepomuk Ritter von Sacher, and Charlotte von Masoch, a Ukrainian noblewoman.
Von Sacher served as a Commissioner of the Imperial Police Forces in Lemberg, and he was recognised with a new title of nobility as Sacher-Masoch awarded by the Austrian Emperor.
Leopold studied law, history and mathematics at Graz University, and after graduating moved back to Lemberg where he became a professor.
At the same time, Masoch turned to the folklore and culture of his homeland, Galicia.
Within a decade his short stories and novels prevailed over his historical non-fiction works, though historical themes continued to imbue his fiction.
Panslavist ideas were prevalent in Masoch's literary work, and he found a particular interest in depicting picturesque types among the various ethnicities that inhabited Galicia.
In 1869, Sacher-Masoch conceived a grandiose series of short stories under the collective title "Legacy of Cain" that would represent the author's aesthetic "Weltanschauung".
The cycle opened with the manifesto "The Wanderer" that brought out misogynist themes that became peculiar to Masoch's writings.
Nevertheless, the published volumes of the series included Masoch's best-known stories, and of them, "Venus in Furs" (1869) is the most famous today.
The short novel expressed Sacher-Masoch's fantasies and fetishes (especially for dominant women wearing fur).
This was a progressive magazine aimed at tolerance and integration for Jews in Saxony, as well as for the emancipation of women with articles on women's education and suffrage.
In his later years, he worked against local antisemitism through an association for adult education called the "Oberhessischer Verein für Volksbildung" (OVV), founded in 1893 with his second wife, Hulda Meister, who had also been his assistant for some years.
On 9 December 1869, Sacher-Masoch and his mistress Baroness Fanny Pistor signed a contract making him her slave for a period of six months, with the stipulation that the Baroness wear furs as often as possible, especially when she was in a cruel mood.
Sacher-Masoch took the alias of "Gregor", a stereotypical male servant's name, and assumed a disguise as the servant of the Baroness.
As in "Venus in Furs", he traveled in the third-class compartment, while she had a seat in first-class, arriving in Venice (Florence, in the novel), where they were not known, and would not arouse suspicion.
Sacher-Masoch pressured his first wife – Aurora von Rümelin, whom he married in 1873 – to live out the experience of the book, against her preferences.
Sacher-Masoch found his family life to be unexciting, and eventually got a divorce and married his assistant.
In his late fifties, his mental health began to deteriorate, and he spent the last years of his life under psychiatric care.
Sacher-Masoch is the great-great-uncle to the British singer and actress Marianne Faithfull on the side of her mother, the Viennese Baroness Eva Erisso.
The following year, a French translation, "Confession de Ma Vie" (1907) by "Wanda von Sacher-Masoch", was printed in Paris by Mercure de France.
An English translation of the French edition was published as "The Confessions of Wanda von Sacher-Masoch" (1991) by RE/Search Publications.
