water is used as the vehicle for the dry-powder pigment to merge with the plaster , and with the setting of the plaster , the painting becomes an important part of the wall .
because of the chemical makeup of the plaster , a binder is not needed .
in painting buon fresco , a rough rough underlayer called the " arriccio " is added to the whole area to be painted and allowed to dry for some days .
many artists sketched their compositions on this underlayer , which would never be seen , in a red pigment called sinopia , a name also used to refer to these under-paintings .

buon frescoes are difficult to create because of the deadline associated with the drying plaster .

the pigments require a binding medium , such as eggisan tempera foley , glue or oil to attach the pigment to the wall .
generally , buon frescos are more durable than any " a secco " work added on top of them .
in most early examples this work has now gone entirely vanished , but a whole painting done " a secco " on a surface roughened to give a key for the paint may survive very well , although damp is more threatening to it than to " buon fresco " .
by the end of the sixteenth century , this had largely displaced " buon fresco " .
