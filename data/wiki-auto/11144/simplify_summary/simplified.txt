fresco is a technique of painting .
water is used as the vehicle for the dry-powder pigment to merge with the plaster , and with the setting of the plaster , the painting becomes an important part of the wall .
the word " fresco " comes from the italian " fresco " meaning " fresh " .
the fresco technique has been used since antiquity .
the word " buon fresco " is used in dry dry plaster .
because of the chemical makeup of the plaster , a binder is not needed .
after a number of hours , the plaster dries in reaction to air .
in painting buon fresco , a rough rough underlayer called the " arriccio " is added to the whole area to be painted and allowed to dry for some days .
many artists sketched their compositions on this underlayer , which would never be seen , in a red pigment called sinopia , a name also used to refer to these under-paintings .
later , new techniques for transferring paper drawings to the wall were developed .
the main lines of a drawing made on paper were pricked over with a point , the paper held against the wall , and a bag of soot foley " spolvero "artharthylusylus picked on them on them on them on them on them on the lines .
if the painting was to be done over an existing fresco , the surface would be rough to provide better adhesion .
on the day of painting , the intonaco , a thinner , smooth layer of fine plaster was added to the amount of wall that was expected to be completed that day , sometimes matching the contours of the landscape , but more often just starting from the top of the composition .
this area is called the " giornata " day 's work " ʼ .
buon frescoes are difficult to create because of the deadline associated with the drying plaster .
generally , a layer of plaster will need ten to twelve hours to dry .
once a " giornata " is dried , no more buon fresco can be done , and the unpainted intonaco must be removed with a tool before starting again the next day .
if mistakes have been made , it may also be necessary to remove the whole intonaco for that area .
the carbonatation of the lime , which fixes the colour in the plaster makes the fresco for future generations .
it scrape indentations into certain areas of the plaster while still wet to increase the illusion of depth and to accent certain areas over others .

michelangelo used this technique as part of his trademark ' outlining ' of his central figures .
in a wall-sized fresco , there may be ten to twenty or even more " giornate " , or separate areas of plaster .
after five centuries , the " giornate " , which were originally nearly invisible , have sometimes become visible , and in many large-scale frescoes , these divisions may be seen from the ground .
additionally , the border between giornate was often covered by an " a secco " painting , which has since fallen off .
one of the first painters in the post-classical period to use this technique was the isaac mastermind or master of the isaac fresco .
a person who makes frescos is called a " fresco " .
a secco or fresco-secco painting is done on dry plaster plaster chose " secco " for dry .
the pigments require a binding medium , such as eggisan tempera foley , glue or oil to attach the pigment to the wall .
it is important to distinguish between " a secco " work done on top of " buon fresco " .
generally , buon frescos are more durable than any " a secco " work added on top of them .
the additional " a secco " work would be done to make changes , and sometimes to add small details .
blue was a particular problem , and skies and blue robes were often added " a secco " .
it has also become increasingly clear , thanks to modern analytical techniques .
in most early examples this work has now gone entirely vanished , but a whole painting done " a secco " on a surface roughened to give a key for the paint may survive very well , although damp is more threatening to it than to " buon fresco " .
a third type called a " mezzo-fresco " is painted on nearly dry intonaco .
by the end of the sixteenth century , this had largely displaced " buon fresco " .
this technique had , in reduced form , the advantages of " a secco " work .
the three key advantages of work done entirely " a secco " were that it was quicker , mistakes could be corrected , and the colours varied less from when applied to when fully dry — in wet fresco there was a considerable change .
for wholly " a secco " work , the intonaco is laid with a rougher finish , allowed to dry completely and then usually given a key by rubbing with sand .
the painter then proceeds much as he would on a canvas or wood panel .
