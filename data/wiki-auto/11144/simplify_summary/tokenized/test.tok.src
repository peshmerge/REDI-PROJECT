[CLS] fresco ( plural fresco ##s or frescoes ) is a technique of mural painting executed upon freshly laid , or wet lime plaster . [SEP]
[CLS] water is used as the vehicle for the dry - powder pigment to merge with the plaster , and with the setting of the plaster , the painting becomes an integral part of the wall . [SEP]
[CLS] the word fresco is derived from the italian adjective " fresco " meaning " fresh " , and may thus be contrasted with fresco - sec ##co or sec ##co mural painting techniques , which are applied to dried plaster , to supplement painting in fresco . [SEP]
[CLS] the fresco technique has been employed since antiquity and is closely associated with italian renaissance painting . [SEP]
[CLS] " bu ##on fresco " pigment is mixed with room temperature water and is used on a thin layer of wet , fresh plaster , called the into ##nac ##o ( after the italian word for plaster ) . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the chemical makeup of the plaster , a bind ##er is not required , as the pigment mixed solely with the water will sink into the into ##nac ##o , which itself becomes the medium holding the pigment . [SEP]
[CLS] the pigment is absorbed by the wet plaster ; after a number of hours , the plaster dr ##ies in reaction to air : it is this chemical reaction which fix ##es the pigment particles in the plaster . [SEP]
[CLS] the chemical processes are as follows : in painting " bu ##on fresco " , a rough under ##layer called the " ar ##ric ##cio " is added to the whole area to be painted and allowed to dry for some days . [SEP]
[CLS] many artists sketch ##ed their compositions on this under ##layer , which would never be seen , in a red pigment called sino ##pia , a name also used to refer to these under - paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] later , new techniques for transferring paper drawings to the wall were developed . [SEP]
[CLS] the main lines of a drawing made on paper were prick ##ed over with a point , the paper held against the wall , and a bag of soo ##t ( " sp ##ol ##ver ##o " ) banged on them on produce black dots along the lines . [SEP]
[CLS] if the painting was to be done over an existing fresco , the surface would be rough ##ened to provide better ad ##hesion . [SEP]
[CLS] on the day of painting , the into ##nac ##o , a thinner , smooth layer of fine plaster was added to the amount of wall that was expected to be completed that day , sometimes matching the con ##tour ##s of the figures or the landscape , but more often just starting from the top of the composition . [SEP]
[CLS] this area is called the " gi ##orn ##ata " ( " day ' s work " ) , and the different day stages can usually be seen in a large fresco , by a sort of seam that separates one from the next . [SEP]
[CLS] " bu ##on frescoes " are difficult to create because of the deadline associated with the drying plaster . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , a layer of plaster will require ten to twelve hours to dry ; ideally , an artist would begin to paint after one hour and continue until two hours before the drying time — giving seven to nine hours ' working time . [SEP]
[CLS] once a " gi ##orn ##ata " is dried , no more " bu ##on fresco " can be done , and the un ##pa ##int ##ed into ##nac ##o must be removed with a tool before starting again the next day . [SEP]
[CLS] if mistakes have been made , it may also be necessary to remove the whole into ##nac ##o for that area — or to change them later , " a sec ##co " . [SEP]
[CLS] an ind ##is ##pen ##sable component of this process is the carbon ##ata ##tion of the lime , which fix ##es the colour in the plaster ensuring du ##ra ##bility of the fresco for future generations . [SEP]
[CLS] a technique used in the popular frescoes of michelangelo and raphael was to scrape ind ##entation ##s into certain areas of the plaster while still wet to increase the illusion of depth and to accent certain areas over others . [SEP]
[CLS] the eyes of the people of the school of athens are sunken - in using this technique which causes the eyes to seem deeper and more pens ##ive . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo used this technique as part of his trademark ' out ##lining ' of his central figures within his frescoes . [SEP]
[CLS] in a wall - sized fresco , there may be ten to twenty or even more " gi ##orn ##ate " , or separate areas of plaster . [SEP]
[CLS] after five centuries , the " gi ##orn ##ate " , which were originally nearly invisible , have sometimes become visible , and in many large - scale frescoes , these divisions may be seen from the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , the border between gi ##orn ##ate was often covered by an " a sec ##co " painting , which has since fallen off . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the first painters in the post - classical period to use this technique was the isaac master ( or master of the isaac fresco , and thus a name used to refer to the unknown master of a particular painting ) in the upper basilica of saint francis in ass ##isi . [SEP]
[CLS] a person who creates fresco is called a fresco ##ist . [SEP]
[CLS] a sec ##co or fresco - sec ##co painting is done on dry plaster ( " sec ##co " meaning " dry " in italian ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the pigment ##s thus require a binding medium , such as egg ( temper ##a ) , glue or oil to attach the pigment to the wall . [SEP]
[CLS] it is important to distinguish between " a sec ##co " work done on top of " bu ##on fresco " , which according to most authorities was in fact standard from the middle ages onwards , and work done entirely " a sec ##co " on a blank wall . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , " bu ##on fresco " works are more durable than any " a sec ##co " work added on top of them , because " a sec ##co " work lasts better with a rough ##ened plaster surface , whilst true fresco should have a smooth one . [SEP]
[CLS] the additional " a sec ##co " work would be done to make changes , and sometimes to add small details , but also because not all colours can be achieved in true fresco , because only some pigment ##s work chemical ##ly in the very al ##kali ##ne environment of fresh lime - based plaster . [SEP]
[CLS] blue was a particular problem , and skies and blue robes were often added " a sec ##co " , because neither az ##uri ##te blue nor lap ##is la ##zu ##li , the only two blue pigment ##s then available , works well in wet fresco . [SEP]
[CLS] it has also become increasingly clear , thanks to modern analytical techniques , that even in the early italian renaissance painters quite frequently employed " a sec ##co " techniques so as to allow the use of a broader range of pigment ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in most early examples this work has now entirely vanished , but a whole painting done " a sec ##co " on a surface rough ##ened to give a key for the paint may survive very well , although damp is more threatening to it than to " bu ##on fresco " . [SEP]
[CLS] a third type called a " me ##zzo - fresco " is painted on nearly dry into ##nac ##o — firm enough not to take a thumb - print , says the sixteenth - century author ign ##azi ##o po ##zzo — so that the pigment only penetrate ##s slightly into the plaster . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of the sixteenth century this had largely displaced " bu ##on fresco " , and was used by painters such as gia ##nb ##att ##ista tie ##pol ##o or michelangelo . [SEP]
[CLS] this technique had , in reduced form , the advantages of " a sec ##co " work . [SEP]
[CLS] the three key advantages of work done entirely " a sec ##co " were that it was quicker , mistakes could be corrected , and the colours varied less from when applied to when fully dry — in wet fresco there was a considerable change . [SEP]
[CLS] for wholly " a sec ##co " work , the into ##nac ##o is laid with a rough ##er finish , allowed to dry completely and then usually given a key by rubbing with sand . [SEP]
[CLS] the painter then proceeds much as he would on a canvas or wood panel . [SEP]
[CLS] an old fresco is the " invest ##it ##ure of z ##im ##ri - lim " from syria , dating from the early 18th century bc . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , ancient egyptians painted many tombs and houses , but those wall paintings are not frescoes . [SEP]
[CLS] the oldest frescoes done in the bu ##on fresco method date from the first half of the second millennium bce during the bronze age and are to be found among aegean civilizations , more precisely the min ##oa ##n culture from the island of crete and other islands of the aegean sea . [SEP]
[CLS] the most famous of these , the tore ##ador , depicts a sacred ceremony in which individuals jump over the backs of large bulls . [SEP]
[CLS] the oldest surviving min ##oa ##n frescoes are found on the island of santo ##rini ( classical ##ly known as the ##ra ) , dated to the neo - pal ##ati ##al period ( c . 1640 – 1600 bc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] while some similar frescoes have been found in other locations around the mediterranean basin , particularly in egypt and morocco , their origins are subject to speculation . [SEP]
[CLS] some art historians believe that fresco artists from crete may have been sent to various locations as part of a trade exchange , a possibility which raises to the fore the importance of this art form within the society of the times . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common form of " fresco " was egyptian wall paintings in tombs , usually using the " a sec ##co " technique . [SEP]
[CLS] frescoes were also painted in ancient greece , but few of these works have survived . [SEP]
[CLS] in southern italy , at pa ##est ##um , which was a greek colony of the magna gr ##ae ##cia , a tomb containing frescoes dating back to 470 bc , the so - called tomb of the diver was discovered in june 1968 . [SEP]

[CLS] roman wall paintings , such as those at the magnificent villa dei mister ##i ( 1st century b . c . ) in the ruins of po ##mp ##ei ##i , and others at her ##cula ##ne ##um , were completed in " bu ##on fresco . " [SEP]
[CLS] late roman empire ( christian ) 1st - 2nd - century frescoes were found in cat ##aco ##mbs beneath rome , and byzantine icons were also found in cyprus , crete , ep ##hes ##us , cap ##pad ##oc ##ia , and antioch . [SEP]
[CLS] roman frescoes were done by the artist painting the artwork on the still damp plaster of the wall , so that the painting is part of the wall , actually colored plaster . [SEP]
[CLS] also a historical collection of ancient christian frescoes can be found in the churches of gore ##me turkey . [SEP]
[CLS] thanks to large number of ancient rock - cut cave temples , valuable ancient and early medieval frescoes have been preserved in more than 20 locations of india . [SEP]
[CLS] the frescoes on the ceilings and walls of the aj ##anta caves were painted between c . 200 bc and 600 and are the oldest known frescoes in india . [SEP]
[CLS] they depict the ja ##taka tales that are stories of the buddha ' s life in former existence ##s as bo ##dhi ##sat ##tv ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] the narrative episodes are depicted one after another although not in a linear order . [SEP]
[CLS] their identification has been a core area of research on the subject since the time of the site ' s red ##is ##co ##very in 1819 . [SEP]
[CLS] other locations with valuable preserved ancient and early medieval frescoes include bag ##h caves , el ##lor ##a caves , sit ##tana ##vas ##al , arm ##ama ##lai cave , bad ##ami cave temples and other locations . [SEP]

[CLS] the si ##giri ##ya frescoes are found in si ##giri ##ya in sri lanka . [SEP]
[CLS] painted during the reign of king ka ##sh ##ya ##pa i ( ruled 47 ##7 — 495 ad ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the generally accepted view is that they are portrayal ##s of women of the royal court of the king depicted as celestial ny ##mp ##hs shower ##ing flowers upon the humans below . [SEP]
[CLS] they bear some resemblance to the gupta style of painting found in the aj ##anta caves in india . [SEP]
[CLS] they are , however , far more en ##li ##ven ##ed and colorful and uniquely sri lankan in character . [SEP]
[CLS] they are the only surviving secular art from antiquity found in sri lanka today . [SEP]
[CLS] the painting technique used on the si ##giri ##ya paintings is " fresco lust ##ro " . [SEP]
[CLS] it varies slightly from the pure fresco technique in that it also contains a mild binding agent or glue . [SEP]
[CLS] this gives the painting added du ##ra ##bility , as clearly demonstrated by the fact that they have survived , exposed to the elements , for over 1 , 500 years . [SEP]
[CLS] located in a small sheltered depression a hundred meters above ground only 19 survive today . [SEP]
[CLS] ancient references , however , refer to the existence of as many as five hundred of these frescoes . [SEP]
[CLS] the late medieval period and the renaissance saw the most prominent use of fresco , particularly in italy , where most churches and many government buildings still feature fresco decoration . [SEP]
[CLS] this change coincided with the re ##eva ##lu ##ation of murals in the liturgy . [SEP]
[CLS] romanesque churches in catalonia were richly painted in 12th and 13th century , with both decorative and educational — for the ill ##iter ##ate faithful ##s — roles , as can be seen in the mn ##ac in barcelona , where is kept a large collection of catalan romanesque art . [SEP]
[CLS] in denmark too , church wall paintings or " ka ##lk ##mal ##erie ##r " were widely used in the middle ages ( first romanesque , then gothic ) and can be seen in some 600 danish churches as well as in churches in the south of sweden , which was danish at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the rare examples of islamic fresco painting can be seen in q ##as ##r am ##ra , the desert palace of the um ##ay ##yad ##s in the 8th century mag ##ote ##z . [SEP]
[CLS] northern romania ( historical region of mold ##avia ) boasts about a dozen painted monasteries , completely covered with fresco ##s inside and out , that date from the last quarter of the 15th century to the second quarter of the 16th century . [SEP]
[CLS] the most remarkable are the monastic foundations at vo ##rone ##t ( 148 ##7 ) , arbor ##e ( 150 ##3 ) , humor ( 153 ##0 ) , and mold ##ov ##ita ( 153 ##2 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] su ##ce ##vita , dating from 1600 , represents a late return to the style developed some 70 years earlier . [SEP]

[CLS] the climate and environment of venice has proved to be a problem for frescoes and other works of art in the city for centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] the city is built on a lagoon in northern italy . [SEP]
[CLS] the humidity and the rise of water over the centuries have created a phenomenon known as rising damp . [SEP]
[CLS] as the lagoon water rises and see ##ps into the foundation of a building , the water is absorbed and rises up through the walls often causing damage to frescoes . [SEP]
[CLS] venetian ##s have become quite adept in the conservation methods of frescoes . [SEP]
[CLS] the mold as ##per ##gill ##us ve ##rs ##ico ##lor can grow after flooding , to consume nutrients from frescoes . [SEP]
[CLS] the following is the process that was used when rescuing frescoes in la fen ##ice , a venetian opera house , but the same process can be used for similarly damaged frescoes . [SEP]
[CLS] first , a protection and support bandage of cotton ga ##uze and poly ##vin ##yl alcohol is applied . [SEP]
[CLS] difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized vacuum ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] the other areas that are easier to remove ( because they had been damaged by less water ) are removed with a paper pulp com ##press saturated with bi ##carbon ##ate of ammonia solutions and removed with dei ##oni ##zed water . [SEP]
[CLS] these sections are strengthened and re ##att ##ache ##d then clean ##sed with base exchange resin com ##press ##es and the wall and pictorial layer were strengthened with bari ##um hydra ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] the cracks and detachments are stopped with lime put ##ty and injected with an ep ##ox ##y resin loaded with micro ##ni ##zed si ##lica . [SEP]
