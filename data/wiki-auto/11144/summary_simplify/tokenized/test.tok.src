[CLS] water is used as the vehicle for the dry - powder pigment to merge with the plaster , and with the setting of the plaster , the painting becomes an integral part of the wall . [SEP]
[CLS] the word fresco is derived from the italian adjective " fresco " meaning " fresh " , and may thus be contrasted with fresco - sec ##co or sec ##co mural painting techniques , which are applied to dried plaster , to supplement painting in fresco . [SEP]
[CLS] " bu ##on fresco " pigment is mixed with room temperature water and is used on a thin layer of wet , fresh plaster , called the into ##nac ##o ( after the italian word for plaster ) . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the chemical makeup of the plaster , a bind ##er is not required , as the pigment mixed solely with the water will sink into the into ##nac ##o , which itself becomes the medium holding the pigment . [SEP]
[CLS] the pigment is absorbed by the wet plaster ; after a number of hours , the plaster dr ##ies in reaction to air : it is this chemical reaction which fix ##es the pigment particles in the plaster . [SEP]
[CLS] the chemical processes are as follows : in painting " bu ##on fresco " , a rough under ##layer called the " ar ##ric ##cio " is added to the whole area to be painted and allowed to dry for some days . [SEP]
[CLS] many artists sketch ##ed their compositions on this under ##layer , which would never be seen , in a red pigment called sino ##pia , a name also used to refer to these under - paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] the main lines of a drawing made on paper were prick ##ed over with a point , the paper held against the wall , and a bag of soo ##t ( " sp ##ol ##ver ##o " ) banged on them on produce black dots along the lines . [SEP]
[CLS] if the painting was to be done over an existing fresco , the surface would be rough ##ened to provide better ad ##hesion . [SEP]
[CLS] on the day of painting , the into ##nac ##o , a thinner , smooth layer of fine plaster was added to the amount of wall that was expected to be completed that day , sometimes matching the con ##tour ##s of the figures or the landscape , but more often just starting from the top of the composition . [SEP]
[CLS] this area is called the " gi ##orn ##ata " ( " day ' s work " ) , and the different day stages can usually be seen in a large fresco , by a sort of seam that separates one from the next . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , a layer of plaster will require ten to twelve hours to dry ; ideally , an artist would begin to paint after one hour and continue until two hours before the drying time — giving seven to nine hours ' working time . [SEP]
[CLS] if mistakes have been made , it may also be necessary to remove the whole into ##nac ##o for that area — or to change them later , " a sec ##co " . [SEP]
[CLS] an ind ##is ##pen ##sable component of this process is the carbon ##ata ##tion of the lime , which fix ##es the colour in the plaster ensuring du ##ra ##bility of the fresco for future generations . [SEP]
[CLS] a technique used in the popular frescoes of michelangelo and raphael was to scrape ind ##entation ##s into certain areas of the plaster while still wet to increase the illusion of depth and to accent certain areas over others . [SEP]
[CLS] michelangelo used this technique as part of his trademark ' out ##lining ' of his central figures within his frescoes . [SEP]
[CLS] after five centuries , the " gi ##orn ##ate " , which were originally nearly invisible , have sometimes become visible , and in many large - scale frescoes , these divisions may be seen from the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , the border between gi ##orn ##ate was often covered by an " a sec ##co " painting , which has since fallen off . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the first painters in the post - classical period to use this technique was the isaac master ( or master of the isaac fresco , and thus a name used to refer to the unknown master of a particular painting ) in the upper basilica of saint francis in ass ##isi . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , " bu ##on fresco " works are more durable than any " a sec ##co " work added on top of them , because " a sec ##co " work lasts better with a rough ##ened plaster surface , whilst true fresco should have a smooth one . [SEP]
[CLS] the additional " a sec ##co " work would be done to make changes , and sometimes to add small details , but also because not all colours can be achieved in true fresco , because only some pigment ##s work chemical ##ly in the very al ##kali ##ne environment of fresh lime - based plaster . [SEP]
[CLS] it has also become increasingly clear , thanks to modern analytical techniques , that even in the early italian renaissance painters quite frequently employed " a sec ##co " techniques so as to allow the use of a broader range of pigment ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in most early examples this work has now entirely vanished , but a whole painting done " a sec ##co " on a surface rough ##ened to give a key for the paint may survive very well , although damp is more threatening to it than to " bu ##on fresco " . [SEP]
[CLS] a third type called a " me ##zzo - fresco " is painted on nearly dry into ##nac ##o — firm enough not to take a thumb - print , says the sixteenth - century author ign ##azi ##o po ##zzo — so that the pigment only penetrate ##s slightly into the plaster . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of the sixteenth century this had largely displaced " bu ##on fresco " , and was used by painters such as gia ##nb ##att ##ista tie ##pol ##o or michelangelo . [SEP]
[CLS] the three key advantages of work done entirely " a sec ##co " were that it was quicker , mistakes could be corrected , and the colours varied less from when applied to when fully dry — in wet fresco there was a considerable change . [SEP]
[CLS] the painter then proceeds much as he would on a canvas or wood panel . [SEP]
[CLS] the oldest frescoes done in the bu ##on fresco method date from the first half of the second millennium bce during the bronze age and are to be found among aegean civilizations , more precisely the min ##oa ##n culture from the island of crete and other islands of the aegean sea . [SEP]
[CLS] the most famous of these , the tore ##ador , depicts a sacred ceremony in which individuals jump over the backs of large bulls . [SEP]
[CLS] while some similar frescoes have been found in other locations around the mediterranean basin , particularly in egypt and morocco , their origins are subject to speculation . [SEP]
[CLS] some art historians believe that fresco artists from crete may have been sent to various locations as part of a trade exchange , a possibility which raises to the fore the importance of this art form within the society of the times . [SEP]

[CLS] they bear some resemblance to the gupta style of painting found in the aj ##anta caves in india . [SEP]
[CLS] it varies slightly from the pure fresco technique in that it also contains a mild binding agent or glue . [SEP]
[CLS] the late medieval period and the renaissance saw the most prominent use of fresco , particularly in italy , where most churches and many government buildings still feature fresco decoration . [SEP]
[CLS] romanesque churches in catalonia were richly painted in 12th and 13th century , with both decorative and educational — for the ill ##iter ##ate faithful ##s — roles , as can be seen in the mn ##ac in barcelona , where is kept a large collection of catalan romanesque art . [SEP]
[CLS] in denmark too , church wall paintings or " ka ##lk ##mal ##erie ##r " were widely used in the middle ages ( first romanesque , then gothic ) and can be seen in some 600 danish churches as well as in churches in the south of sweden , which was danish at the time . [SEP]

[CLS] the climate and environment of venice has proved to be a problem for frescoes and other works of art in the city for centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] the humidity and the rise of water over the centuries have created a phenomenon known as rising damp . [SEP]
[CLS] as the lagoon water rises and see ##ps into the foundation of a building , the water is absorbed and rises up through the walls often causing damage to frescoes . [SEP]
