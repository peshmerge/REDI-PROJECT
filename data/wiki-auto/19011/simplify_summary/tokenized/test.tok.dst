[CLS] the miocene is the first geological epoch of the neo ##gen ##e period and extends from about ( ma ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the miocene was named by charles l ##ye ##ll ; its name comes from the greek words ( " " , " less " ) and ( " " , " new " ) and means " less recent " because it has 18 % fewer modern sea invertebrates than the pl ##io ##cene . [SEP]
[CLS] the miocene is preceded by the ol ##igo ##cene and is followed by the pl ##io ##cene . [SEP]
[CLS] as the earth went from the ol ##igo ##cene through the miocene and into the pl ##io ##cene , the climate slowly cooled towards a series of ice ages . [SEP]
[CLS] the miocene boundaries are not marked by a single distinct global event but consist rather of regional ##ly defined boundaries between the warmer ol ##igo ##cene and the cooler pl ##io ##cene epoch . [SEP]
[CLS] the apes first evolved , arose , and diversified during the early miocene ( a ##qui ##tania ##n and bu ##rdi ##gal ##ian stages ) , becoming widespread in the old world . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of this epoch and the start of the following one , the ancestors of humans had split away from the ancestors of the chi ##mp ##an ##zee ##s to follow their own evolutionary path during the final mess ##inian stage ( 7 . 5 – 5 . 3 my ##a ) of the miocene . [SEP]
[CLS] as in the ol ##igo ##cene before it , grasslands continued to expand and forests to d ##wind ##le in extent . [SEP]
[CLS] in the seas of the miocene , ke ##lp forests made their first appearance and soon became one of earth ' s most productive ecosystems . [SEP]
[CLS] the plants and animals of the miocene were rec ##og ##ni ##za ##bly modern . [SEP]
[CLS] mammals and birds were well - established . [SEP]
[CLS] whales , pin ##ni ##ped ##s , and ke ##lp spread . [SEP]
[CLS] the miocene is of particular interest to geologist ##s and pal ##ae ##oc ##lim ##ato ##logists as major phases of the geology of the him ##ala ##ya occurred during the miocene , affecting monsoon ##al patterns in asia , which were inter ##link ##ed with glacial periods in the northern hemisphere . [SEP]
[CLS] european land mammal ages [SEP]
[CLS] north american land mammal ages [SEP]
[CLS] south american land mammal ages [SEP]
[CLS] continents continued to drift toward their present positions . [SEP]
[CLS] of the modern geologic features , only the land bridge between south america and north america was absent , although south america was approaching the western sub ##duction zone in the pacific ocean , causing both the rise of the andes and a southward extension of the me ##so - american peninsula . [SEP]
[CLS] mountain building took place in western north america , europe , and east asia . [SEP]
[CLS] both continental and marine miocene deposits are common worldwide with marine out ##cr ##ops common near modern shoreline ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] well studied continental exposure ##s occur in the north american great plains and in argentina . [SEP]
[CLS] india continued to col ##lide with asia , creating dramatic new mountain ranges . [SEP]
[CLS] the te ##thy ##s sea ##way continued to shrink and then disappeared as africa collided with eu ##rasia in the turkish – arabian region between 19 and 12 ma . [SEP]
[CLS] the subsequent up ##lift of mountains in the western mediterranean region and a global fall in sea levels combined to cause a temporary drying up of the mediterranean sea ( known as the mess ##inian sal ##ini ##ty crisis ) near the end of the miocene . [SEP]
[CLS] the global trend was towards increasing arid ##ity caused primarily by global cooling reducing the ability of the atmosphere to absorb moisture . [SEP]
[CLS] up ##lift of east africa in the late miocene was partly responsible for the shrinking of tropical rain forests in that region , and australia got dr ##ier as it entered a zone of low rainfall in the late miocene . [SEP]
[CLS] during the ol ##igo ##cene and early miocene the coast of northern brazil , colombia , south - central peru , central chile and large swat ##hes of inland pat ##ago ##nia were subject to a marine trans ##gre ##ssion . [SEP]
[CLS] the trans ##gre ##ssion ##s in the west coast of south america is thought to be caused by a regional phenomenon while the steadily rising central segment of the andes represents an exception . [SEP]
[CLS] while there are numerous registers of ol ##igo - miocene trans ##gre ##ssion ##s around the world it is doubtful that these co ##rre ##late . [SEP]
[CLS] it is thought that the ol ##igo - miocene trans ##gre ##ssion in pat ##ago ##nia could have temporarily linked the pacific and atlantic oceans , as in ##fer ##red from the findings of marine in ##vert ##eb ##rate fossils of both atlantic and pacific affinity in la cas ##ca ##da formation . [SEP]
[CLS] connection would have occurred through narrow epic ##ont ##inen ##tal sea ##ways that formed channels in a di ##sse ##cted topography . [SEP]
[CLS] the antarctic plate started to sub ##du ##ct beneath south america 14 million years ago in the miocene , forming the chile triple junction . [SEP]
[CLS] at first the antarctic plate sub ##ducted only in the southernmost tip of pat ##ago ##nia , meaning that the chile triple junction lay near the strait of mage ##llan . [SEP]
[CLS] as the southern part of na ##z ##ca plate and the chile rise became consumed by sub ##duction the more north ##erly regions of the antarctic plate begun to sub ##du ##ct beneath pat ##ago ##nia so that the chile triple junction advanced to the north over time . [SEP]
[CLS] the as ##the ##nos ##pher ##ic window associated to the triple junction disturbed previous patterns of mantle convection beneath pat ##ago ##nia inducing an up ##lift of ca . 1 km that reversed the ol ##igo ##cene – miocene trans ##gre ##ssion . [SEP]
[CLS] as the southern andes rose in the middle miocene ( 14 – 12 million years ago ) the resulting rain shadow originated the pat ##ago ##nian desert to the east . [SEP]
[CLS] climates remained moderately warm , although the slow global cooling that eventually led to the pleistocene g ##la ##ciation ##s continued . [SEP]
[CLS] although a long - term cooling trend was well underway , there is evidence of a warm period during the miocene when the global climate rival ##led that of the ol ##igo ##cene . [SEP]
[CLS] the miocene warming began 21 million years ago and continued until 14 million years ago , when global temperatures took a sharp drop — the middle miocene climate transition ( mm ##ct ) . [SEP]
[CLS] by 8 million years ago , temperatures dropped sharply once again , and the antarctic ice sheet was already approaching its present - day size and thickness . [SEP]
[CLS] greenland may have begun to have large glaciers as early as 7 to 8 million years ago , although the climate for the most part remained warm enough to support forests there well into the pl ##io ##cene . [SEP]
[CLS] life during the miocene epoch was mostly supported by the two newly formed bio ##mes , ke ##lp forests and grasslands . [SEP]
[CLS] grasslands allow for more graz ##ers , such as horses , rhino ##cer ##oses , and hip ##po ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ninety - five percent of modern plants existed by the end of this epoch . [SEP]
[CLS] the coe ##vo ##lu ##tion of grit ##ty , fi ##bro ##us , fire - tolerant grasses and long - legged greg ##ario ##us un ##gul ##ates with high - crowned teeth , led to a major expansion of grass - graz ##er ecosystems , with roaming herds of large , swift graz ##ers pursued by predators across broad sweeps of open grasslands , di ##sp ##la ##cing desert , woodland , and browser ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the higher organic content and water retention of the deeper and richer grassland soils , with long - term burial of carbon in sediments , produced a carbon and water vapor sink . [SEP]
[CLS] this , combined with higher surface al ##bedo and lower eva ##pot ##ran ##sp ##ira ##tion of grassland , contributed to a cooler , dr ##ier climate . [SEP]
[CLS] c grasses , which are able to ass ##imi ##late carbon dioxide and water more efficiently than c grasses , expanded to become ecological ##ly significant near the end of the miocene between 6 and 7 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] the expansion of grasslands and radiation ##s among terrestrial herb ##ivo ##res co ##rre ##lates to fluctuations in co . [SEP]
[CLS] cy ##ca ##ds between 11 . 5 and 5 million years ago began to red ##iver ##si ##fy after previous declines in variety due to climatic changes , and thus modern cy ##ca ##ds are not a good model for a " living fossil " . [SEP]
[CLS] eucalyptus fossil leaves occur in the miocene of new zealand , where the genus is not native today , but have been introduced from australia . [SEP]
