[CLS] the did ##ger ##ido ##o was developed by indigenous australians of northern australia , likely within the last 1 , 500 years and is now in use around the world . [SEP]
[CLS] however , flared instruments play a higher pitch than un ##fl ##are ##d instruments of the same length . [SEP]
[CLS] archaeological studies suggest that people of the ka ##ka ##du region in northern australia have been using the did ##ger ##ido ##o for less than 1 , 000 years , based on the dating of rock art paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] a clear rock painting in gin ##ga ward ##eli ##rr ##hm ##eng , on the northern edge of the ar ##nh ##em land plateau , from the freshwater period ( that had begun 1500 years ago ) shows a did ##ger ##ido ##o player and two song ##men participating in an u ##bar ##r ceremony . [SEP]
[CLS] there are numerous names for the instrument among the aboriginal peoples of northern australia , none of which closely resemble the word " did ##ger ##ido ##o " ( see below ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some did ##ger ##ido ##o enthusiasts , scholars and aboriginal people advocate using local language names for the instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in everyday conversation , some aboriginal people will often use the word " did ##ger ##ido ##o " interchange ##ably with the instrument ' s name in their local language . [SEP]
[CLS] " yi ##dak ##i " ( sometimes sp ##elt " yi ##rda ##ki " ) is one of the most commonly used names although , strictly speaking , it refers to a specific type of the instrument made and used by the yo ##ln ##gu people of north - east ar ##nh ##em land . [SEP]
[CLS] generally the main trunk of the tree is harvested , though a substantial branch may be used instead . [SEP]
[CLS] term ##ites attack these living eucalyptus trees , removing only the dead heart ##wood of the tree , as the living sap ##wood contains a chemical that rep ##els the insects . [SEP]
[CLS] various techniques are employed to find trees with a suitable hollow , including knowledge of landscape and term ##ite activity patterns , and a kind of tap or knock test , in which the bark of the tree is peeled back , and a finger ##nail or the blunt end of a tool , such as an axe , is knocked against the wood to determine if the hollow produces the right resonance . [SEP]
[CLS] once a suit ##ably hollow tree is found , it is cut down and cleaned out , the bark is taken off , the ends trimmed , and the exterior is shaped ; this results in a finished instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] these typically have an upper inside diameter of around 1 . 25 " down to a bell end of anywhere between two and eight inches and have a length corresponding to the desired key . [SEP]
[CLS] did ##ger ##ido ##os can be painted by their maker or a dedicated artist using traditional or modern paints while others retain the natural wood grain with minimal or no decoration . [SEP]
[CLS] the did ##ger ##ido ##o is played with continuously vibrating lips to produce the drone while using a special breathing technique called circular breathing . [SEP]
[CLS] by use of this technique , a skilled player can rep ##len ##ish the air in their lungs , and with practice can sustain a note for as long as desired . [SEP]
[CLS] the second resonance of a did ##ger ##ido ##o ( the note sounded by over ##bl ##owing ) is usually around an 11th higher than the fundamental frequency ( a frequency ratio somewhat less than 3 : 1 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the vibration produced by the player ' s lips has harmonic ##s , i . e . , it has frequency components falling exactly in the ratio 1 : 2 : 3 etc . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the non - harmonic spa ##cing of the instrument ' s resonance ##s means that the harmonic ##s of the fundamental note are not systematically assisted by instrument resonance ##s , as is usually the case for western wind instruments ( e . g . , in the low range of the clarinet , the 1st , 3rd , and 5th harmonic ##s of the reed are assisted by resonance ##s of the bore ) . [SEP]
[CLS] at some frequencies , whose values depend on the position of the player ' s tongue , resonance ##s of the vocal tract inhibit the os ##ci ##lla ##tory flow of air into the instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] these form ##ants , and especially their variation during the in ##hala ##tion and ex ##hala ##tion phases of circular breathing , give the instrument its readily recognizable sound . [SEP]
[CLS] other variations in the did ##ger ##ido ##o ' s sound can be made by adding vocal ##izations to the drone . [SEP]
[CLS] most of the vocal ##izations are related to sounds emitted by australian animals , such as the ding ##o or the ko ##oka ##bu ##rra . [SEP]
[CLS] to produce these sounds , the players simply have to use their vocal folds to produce the sounds of the animals whilst continuing to blow air through the instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] the results range from very high - pitched sounds to much lower sounds involving interference between the lip and vocal fold vibrations . [SEP]
[CLS] the did ##ger ##ido ##o also became a role playing instrument in the experimental and avant - garde music scene . [SEP]
[CLS] industrial music bands like test department generated sounds from this instrument and used them in their industrial performances . [SEP]
[CLS] a notable song featuring a did ##ger ##ido ##o is the band ' s first single " when you gonna learn " , which features prominent did ##ger ##ido ##o playing in both the introduction and solo sections . [SEP]
[CLS] the instrument is commonly used by ambient artist steve roach as a complement to his produced sounds ##cape ##s , in both live and recorded formats . [SEP]
[CLS] chris brooks , lead singer of the new zealand hard rock band like a storm uses the did ##ger ##ido ##o in some of the band ' s songs including " love the way you hate me " from their album " " . [SEP]
[CLS] kate bush made extensive use of the did ##ger ##ido ##o ( played by australian musician rolf harris ) on her album " the dreaming " , which was written and recorded after a holiday in australia . [SEP]
[CLS] charlie mcmahon , who formed the group go ##nd ##wana ##land , was one of the first non - aboriginal players to gain fame as a professional did ##ger ##ido ##o player . [SEP]
[CLS] he invented the did ##jer ##ib ##one , a sliding did ##ger ##ido ##o made from two lengths of plastic tub ##ing ; its playing style is somewhat in the manner of a trombone , hence the port ##man ##tea ##u name . [SEP]
[CLS] for aboriginal peoples of northern australia , the did ##ger ##ido ##o is still used to accompany singers and dancers in cultural ceremonies . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2008 , publisher harper collins apologized for its book " the daring book for girls " , which openly encouraged girls to play the instrument after some aboriginal academics described such encouragement as " extreme cultural ins ##ens ##iti ##vity " and " an extreme faux pas . . . part of a general ignorance that mainstream australia has about aboriginal culture . " [SEP]
[CLS] however , linda bar ##wick , an et ##hn ##om ##us ##ico ##logist , says that though traditionally women have not played the did ##ger ##ido ##o in ceremony , in informal situations there is no prohibition in the dreaming law . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , jem ##ima wi ##mal ##u , a mara woman from the rope ##r river is very proficient at playing the did ##ger ##ido ##o and is featured on the record " aboriginal sound instruments " released in 1978 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1995 , music ##ologist steve kn ##op ##off observed yi ##rr ##kala women performing " dj ##at ##pan ##gar ##ri " songs that are traditionally performed by men and in 1996 , et ##hn ##om ##us ##ico ##logist elizabeth mack ##in ##ley reported women of the yan ##yu ##wa group giving public performances . [SEP]
[CLS] while there is no prohibition in the area of the did ##ger ##ido ##o ' s origin , such restrictions have been applied by other indigenous communities . [SEP]
[CLS] the did ##ger ##ido ##o was introduced to the kimberley ##s almost a century ago but it is only in the last decade that aboriginal men have shown adverse reactions to women playing the instrument and prohibition ##s are especially evident in the south east of australia . [SEP]
[CLS] the belief that women are prohibited from playing is widespread among non - aboriginal people and is also common among aboriginal communities in southern australia ; some et ##hn ##om ##us ##ico ##logists believe that the dissemination of the " taboo " belief and other mis ##con ##ception ##s is a result of commercial agenda ##s and marketing . [SEP]
[CLS] tourists generally rely on shop employees for information when purchasing a did ##ger ##ido ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , the majority of commercial did ##ger ##ido ##o recordings available are distributed by multinational recording companies and feature non - aboriginal ##s playing a new age style of music with liner notes promoting the instrument ' s spirituality which mis ##lea ##ds consumers about the did ##ger ##ido ##o ' s secular role in traditional aboriginal culture . [SEP]
[CLS] the taboo belief is particularly strong among many indigenous groups in the south east of australia , where it is forbidden and considered " cultural theft " for non - indigenous women , and especially performers of " new age " music regardless of gender , to play or even touch a did ##ger ##ido ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2005 study reported in the " british medical journal " found that learning and pr ##act ##ising the did ##ger ##ido ##o helped reduce s ##nor ##ing and ob ##st ##ru ##ctive sleep ap ##nea by strengthening muscles in the upper air ##way , thus reducing their tendency to collapse during sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] control subjects were asked not to play the instrument . [SEP]
