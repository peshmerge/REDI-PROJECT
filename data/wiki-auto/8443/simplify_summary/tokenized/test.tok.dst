[CLS] the did ##ger ##ido ##o ( ; also known as a did ##jer ##id ##u ) is a wind instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] the did ##ger ##ido ##o was developed by indigenous australians of northern australia , likely within the last 1 , 500 years and is now in use around the world . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a wooden trumpet " drone pipe " classified by music ##ologists as a brass aero ##phone . [SEP]
[CLS] a did ##ger ##ido ##o is usually cylindrical or conical , and can measure anywhere from 1 to long . [SEP]
[CLS] most are around 1 . 2 m long . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , the longer the instrument , the lower its pitch or key . [SEP]
[CLS] however , flared instruments play a higher pitch than un ##fl ##are ##d instruments of the same length . [SEP]
[CLS] there are no reliable sources of the exact age of the did ##ger ##ido ##o ' s origin . [SEP]
[CLS] archaeological studies suggest that people of the ka ##ka ##du region in northern australia have been using the did ##ger ##ido ##o for less than 1 , 000 years , based on the dating of rock art paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] a clear rock painting in gin ##ga ward ##eli ##rr ##hm ##eng , on the northern edge of the ar ##nh ##em land plateau , from the freshwater period ( that had begun 1500 years ago ) shows a did ##ger ##ido ##o player and two song ##men participating in an u ##bar ##r ceremony . [SEP]
[CLS] the name " did ##ger ##ido ##o " is not of aboriginal origin and is considered to be an ono ##mat ##op ##oe ##tic word . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest occurrences of the word in print include a 1908 edition of the " hamilton spectator " , a 1914 edition of " the northern territory times and gazette " , and a 1919 issue of " smith ' s weekly " where it was referred to as a " did ##jer ##ry " which produced the sound â€“ ( ph ##onic ) " did ##jer ##ry , did ##jer ##ry , did ##jer ##ry and so on ad in ##fin ##it ##um " . [SEP]
[CLS] a rival explanation , that did ##ger ##ido ##o is a corruption of the irish gaelic language phrase " du ##dai ##re dub ##h " or " du ##idi ##re du ##th " , is controversial . [SEP]
[CLS] " du ##dai ##re " / " du ##idi ##re " is a noun that , depending on the context , may mean " trumpeter " , " hum ##mer " , " cr ##oon ##er " or " puff ##er " while " dub ##h " means " black " and " du ##th " means " native " . [SEP]
[CLS] there are numerous names for the instrument among the aboriginal peoples of northern australia , none of which closely resemble the word " did ##ger ##ido ##o " ( see below ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some did ##ger ##ido ##o enthusiasts , scholars and aboriginal people advocate using local language names for the instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in everyday conversation , some aboriginal people will often use the word " did ##ger ##ido ##o " interchange ##ably with the instrument ' s name in their local language . [SEP]
[CLS] " yi ##dak ##i " ( sometimes sp ##elt " yi ##rda ##ki " ) is one of the most commonly used names although , strictly speaking , it refers to a specific type of the instrument made and used by the yo ##ln ##gu people of north - east ar ##nh ##em land . [SEP]
[CLS] yo ##ln ##gu also use the synonym " man ##da ##pu ##l " to refer to the instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] there are numerous other , regional names for the did ##ger ##ido ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] the following are some of the more common of these . [SEP]
[CLS] traditional did ##ger ##ido ##os are usually made from hardwood ##s , especially the various eucalyptus species that are endemic to northern and central australia . [SEP]
[CLS] generally the main trunk of the tree is harvested , though a substantial branch may be used instead . [SEP]
[CLS] traditional did ##ger ##ido ##o makers seek suit ##ably hollow live trees in areas with obvious term ##ite activity . [SEP]
[CLS] term ##ites attack these living eucalyptus trees , removing only the dead heart ##wood of the tree , as the living sap ##wood contains a chemical that rep ##els the insects . [SEP]
[CLS] various techniques are employed to find trees with a suitable hollow , including knowledge of landscape and term ##ite activity patterns , and a kind of tap or knock test , in which the bark of the tree is peeled back , and a finger ##nail or the blunt end of a tool , such as an axe , is knocked against the wood to determine if the hollow produces the right resonance . [SEP]
[CLS] once a suit ##ably hollow tree is found , it is cut down and cleaned out , the bark is taken off , the ends trimmed , and the exterior is shaped ; this results in a finished instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] a rim of bees ##wa ##x may be applied to the mouth ##piece end . [SEP]
[CLS] non - traditional did ##ger ##ido ##os can be made from native or non - native hard woods ( typically split , hollow ##ed and rejoined ) , glass , fiber ##glass , metal , ag ##ave , clay , hem ##p ( in the form of a bio ##pl ##astic named ze ##lf ##o ) , pv ##c pip ##ing and carbon fibre . [SEP]
[CLS] these typically have an upper inside diameter of around 1 . 25 " down to a bell end of anywhere between two and eight inches and have a length corresponding to the desired key . [SEP]
[CLS] the end of the pipe can be shaped and smoothed to create a comfortable mouth ##piece or an added mouth ##piece can be made of any shaped and smoothed material such as rubber , rubber stop ##per with a hole or bees ##wa ##x . [SEP]
[CLS] modern did ##ger ##ido ##o designs are distinct from the traditional australian aboriginal did ##ger ##ido ##o , and are innovations recognized by music ##ologists . [SEP]
[CLS] did ##ger ##ido ##o design innovation started in the late 20th century using non - traditional materials and non - traditional shapes . [SEP]
[CLS] did ##ger ##ido ##os can be painted by their maker or a dedicated artist using traditional or modern paints while others retain the natural wood grain with minimal or no decoration . [SEP]
[CLS] the did ##ger ##ido ##o is played with continuously vibrating lips to produce the drone while using a special breathing technique called circular breathing . [SEP]
[CLS] this requires breathing in through the nose whilst simultaneously ex ##pel ##ling stored air out of the mouth using the tongue and cheeks . [SEP]
[CLS] by use of this technique , a skilled player can rep ##len ##ish the air in their lungs , and with practice can sustain a note for as long as desired . [SEP]
[CLS] recordings exist of modern did ##ger ##ido ##o players playing continuously for more than 40 minutes ; mark atkins on " did ##ger ##ido ##o concerto " ( 1994 ) plays for over 50 minutes continuously . [SEP]
[CLS] the did ##ger ##ido ##o functions " . . . as an aura ##l ka ##lei ##dos ##cope of tim ##bre ##s " and that " the extremely difficult vi ##rt ##uo ##so techniques developed by expert performers find no parallel elsewhere . " [SEP]
[CLS] a term ##ite - bored did ##ger ##ido ##o has an irregular shape that , overall , usually increases in diameter towards the lower end . [SEP]
[CLS] this shape means that its resonance ##s occur at frequencies that are not harmonica ##lly spaced in frequency . [SEP]
[CLS] this contrasts with the harmonic spa ##cing of the resonance ##s in a cylindrical plastic pipe , whose res ##ona ##nt frequencies fall in the ratio 1 : 3 : 5 etc . [SEP]
[CLS] the second resonance of a did ##ger ##ido ##o ( the note sounded by over ##bl ##owing ) is usually around an 11th higher than the fundamental frequency ( a frequency ratio somewhat less than 3 : 1 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the vibration produced by the player ' s lips has harmonic ##s , i . e . , it has frequency components falling exactly in the ratio 1 : 2 : 3 etc . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the non - harmonic spa ##cing of the instrument ' s resonance ##s means that the harmonic ##s of the fundamental note are not systematically assisted by instrument resonance ##s , as is usually the case for western wind instruments ( e . g . , in the low range of the clarinet , the 1st , 3rd , and 5th harmonic ##s of the reed are assisted by resonance ##s of the bore ) . [SEP]
[CLS] sufficiently strong resonance ##s of the vocal tract can strongly influence the tim ##bre of the instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] at some frequencies , whose values depend on the position of the player ' s tongue , resonance ##s of the vocal tract inhibit the os ##ci ##lla ##tory flow of air into the instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] bands of frequencies that are not thus inhibit ##ed produce form ##ants in the output sound . [SEP]
[CLS] these form ##ants , and especially their variation during the in ##hala ##tion and ex ##hala ##tion phases of circular breathing , give the instrument its readily recognizable sound . [SEP]
[CLS] other variations in the did ##ger ##ido ##o ' s sound can be made by adding vocal ##izations to the drone . [SEP]
[CLS] most of the vocal ##izations are related to sounds emitted by australian animals , such as the ding ##o or the ko ##oka ##bu ##rra . [SEP]
[CLS] to produce these sounds , the players simply have to use their vocal folds to produce the sounds of the animals whilst continuing to blow air through the instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] the results range from very high - pitched sounds to much lower sounds involving interference between the lip and vocal fold vibrations . [SEP]
[CLS] adding vocal ##izations increases the complexity of the playing . [SEP]
[CLS] modern performances using the did ##ger ##ido ##o include combining it with beat ##box ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] it was featured on the british children ' s tv series " blue peter " . [SEP]
[CLS] the did ##ger ##ido ##o also became a role playing instrument in the experimental and avant - garde music scene . [SEP]
[CLS] industrial music bands like test department generated sounds from this instrument and used them in their industrial performances . [SEP]
[CLS] it is very often used in the music project na ##akh ##um which combines extreme metal and ethnic music . [SEP]
[CLS] early songs by the acid jazz band jam ##iro ##qua ##i featured did ##ger ##ido ##o player wallis buchanan ( until he left the band in 1999 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a notable song featuring a did ##ger ##ido ##o is the band ' s first single " when you gonna learn " , which features prominent did ##ger ##ido ##o playing in both the introduction and solo sections . [SEP]
[CLS] the instrument is commonly used by ambient artist steve roach as a complement to his produced sounds ##cape ##s , in both live and recorded formats . [SEP]
[CLS] it features prominently in his collaborative work " " ( with australian aboriginal artist david hudson and cell ##ist sarah hopkins ) as well as " dream ##time return " . [SEP]
[CLS] it is used in the indian song " ja ##ane ky ##on " from the film " dil cha ##hta hai " . [SEP]
[CLS] chris brooks , lead singer of the new zealand hard rock band like a storm uses the did ##ger ##ido ##o in some of the band ' s songs including " love the way you hate me " from their album " " . [SEP]
[CLS] kate bush made extensive use of the did ##ger ##ido ##o ( played by australian musician rolf harris ) on her album " the dreaming " , which was written and recorded after a holiday in australia . [SEP]
[CLS] charlie mcmahon , who formed the group go ##nd ##wana ##land , was one of the first non - aboriginal players to gain fame as a professional did ##ger ##ido ##o player . [SEP]
[CLS] he has toured internationally with midnight oil . [SEP]
[CLS] he invented the did ##jer ##ib ##one , a sliding did ##ger ##ido ##o made from two lengths of plastic tub ##ing ; its playing style is somewhat in the manner of a trombone , hence the port ##man ##tea ##u name . [SEP]
[CLS] traditionally , the did ##ger ##ido ##o was played as an accompaniment to ceremonial dancing and singing and for solo or recreational purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] for aboriginal peoples of northern australia , the did ##ger ##ido ##o is still used to accompany singers and dancers in cultural ceremonies . [SEP]
[CLS] today , most did ##ger ##ido ##o playing is recreational but it has become an important commercial activity in tourism and a more limited professional activity in music performances and recordings . [SEP]
[CLS] pair sticks , sometimes called " clap ##stick ##s " ( " bi ##lma " or " bi ##ml ##a " by some traditional groups ) , establish the beat for the songs during ceremonies . [SEP]
[CLS] the rhythm of the did ##ger ##ido ##o and the beat of the clap ##stick ##s are precise , and these patterns have been handed down for many generations . [SEP]
[CLS] in the wang ##ga genre , the song - man starts with vocals and then introduces " bi ##lma " to the accompaniment of did ##ger ##ido ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] traditionally , only men play the did ##ger ##ido ##o and sing during ceremonial occasions and playing by females is sometimes discouraged by aboriginal communities and elders . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2008 , publisher harper collins apologized for its book " the daring book for girls " , which openly encouraged girls to play the instrument after some aboriginal academics described such encouragement as " extreme cultural ins ##ens ##iti ##vity " and " an extreme faux pas . . . part of a general ignorance that mainstream australia has about aboriginal culture . " [SEP]
[CLS] however , linda bar ##wick , an et ##hn ##om ##us ##ico ##logist , says that though traditionally women have not played the did ##ger ##ido ##o in ceremony , in informal situations there is no prohibition in the dreaming law . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , jem ##ima wi ##mal ##u , a mara woman from the rope ##r river is very proficient at playing the did ##ger ##ido ##o and is featured on the record " aboriginal sound instruments " released in 1978 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1995 , music ##ologist steve kn ##op ##off observed yi ##rr ##kala women performing " dj ##at ##pan ##gar ##ri " songs that are traditionally performed by men and in 1996 , et ##hn ##om ##us ##ico ##logist elizabeth mack ##in ##ley reported women of the yan ##yu ##wa group giving public performances . [SEP]
[CLS] while there is no prohibition in the area of the did ##ger ##ido ##o ' s origin , such restrictions have been applied by other indigenous communities . [SEP]
[CLS] the did ##ger ##ido ##o was introduced to the kimberley ##s almost a century ago but it is only in the last decade that aboriginal men have shown adverse reactions to women playing the instrument and prohibition ##s are especially evident in the south east of australia . [SEP]
[CLS] the belief that women are prohibited from playing is widespread among non - aboriginal people and is also common among aboriginal communities in southern australia ; some et ##hn ##om ##us ##ico ##logists believe that the dissemination of the " taboo " belief and other mis ##con ##ception ##s is a result of commercial agenda ##s and marketing . [SEP]
[CLS] tourists generally rely on shop employees for information when purchasing a did ##ger ##ido ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , the majority of commercial did ##ger ##ido ##o recordings available are distributed by multinational recording companies and feature non - aboriginal ##s playing a new age style of music with liner notes promoting the instrument ' s spirituality which mis ##lea ##ds consumers about the did ##ger ##ido ##o ' s secular role in traditional aboriginal culture . [SEP]
[CLS] the taboo belief is particularly strong among many indigenous groups in the south east of australia , where it is forbidden and considered " cultural theft " for non - indigenous women , and especially performers of " new age " music regardless of gender , to play or even touch a did ##ger ##ido ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2005 study reported in the " british medical journal " found that learning and pr ##act ##ising the did ##ger ##ido ##o helped reduce s ##nor ##ing and ob ##st ##ru ##ctive sleep ap ##nea by strengthening muscles in the upper air ##way , thus reducing their tendency to collapse during sleep . [SEP]
[CLS] in the study , intervention subjects were trained in and practiced did ##ger ##ido ##o playing , including circular breathing and other techniques . [SEP]
[CLS] control subjects were asked not to play the instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] subjects were surveyed before and after the study period to assess the effects of intervention . [SEP]
[CLS] a small 2010 study noted improvements in the asthma management of aboriginal teens when incorporating did ##ger ##ido ##o playing . [SEP]
