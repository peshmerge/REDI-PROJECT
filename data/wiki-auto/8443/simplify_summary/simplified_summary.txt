the didgeridoo was developed by indigenous australians of northern australia , likely within the last 1,500 years and is now in use around the world .
a didgeridoo is usually cylindrical , and can measure anywhere from 1 to long .
the longer the instrument , the lower the pitch or key of the instrument , is generally the instrument .
a clear rock painting in ginga wardelirrhmeng , on the northern edge of the arnhem land plateau , from the freshwater period specifies a didgeridoo player and two songmen participating in an ubarr ceremony .
the earliest occurrences of the word in print include a 1908 edition of the " hamilton spectator " , a 1914 edition of " the northern territory times and gazette " , and a 1919 issue of " smith 's weekly " .

generally the main trunk of the tree is harvested , though a substantial branch may be used instead .
termites attack these living eucalyptus trees , removing only the dead heartwood of the tree , as the living sapwood contains a chemical that repels the insects .
different techniques are used to find trees with a suitable hollow , including knowledge of landscape and termite activity patterns , and a kind of tap or knock test , in which the bark of the tree is peeled back , and a fingernail or the blunt end of a tool , such as an axe , is knocked against the wood to determine if the right resonance produces the right resonance .
once a suitably hollow tree is found , it is cut down and cleaned out , the bark is taken off , the ends trimmed , and the outside is shaped .
these typically have an upper inside diameter of around 1.25 " down to a bell end of anywhere between two and eight inches and have a length corresponding to the desired key .
didgeridoos can be painted by their maker or a dedicated artist using traditional or modern paints .
the didgeridoo is played with continuously vibrating lips to make the drone while using a special way of breathing called circular breathing .

the didgeridoo uses the didgeridoo 's act as an aural kaleidoscope of timbres .
a didgeridoo has a shape that , overall , usually increases in diameter towards the lower end .
the second resonance of a didgeridoo is usually around an 11th higher than the fundamental frequency .
the vibration produced by the lips has harmonics , i . e . , it has frequency components falling exactly in the ratio 1 : 2 : 3 etc .
at some frequencies , resonances of the voice cavity stop the oscillatory flow of air into the instrument .
these formants , and especially their variation during the inhalation and exhalation phases of circular breathing , give the instrument its readily recognizable sound .
other changes in the didgeridoo 's sound can be made by adding vocal sounds to the drone .
most of the vocal sounds are related to sounds emitted by australian animals , such as the dingo or the kookaburra .
to make these sounds , the players simply use their vocal cords to make the sounds of the animals whilst continuing to blow air through the instrument .
the results range from very high-pitched sounds to very low sounds .

for aboriginal peoples of northern australia , the didgeridoo is still used for singers and dancers in cultural ceremonies .

tourists usually rely on shop employees for information when buying a didgeridoo .
also , the majority of commercial didgeridoo recordings available are distributed by multinational recording companies and feature non-aboriginals playing a new age style of music with liner notes promoting the instrument 's spirituality which misleads people about the didgeridoo 's secular role in traditional aboriginal culture .
a 2005 study in the british medical journal found that learning and practising the didgeridoo helped reduce snoring and sleep apnea by strengthening muscles in the upper airway .
in the study , intervention subjects were trained in and practiced didgeridoo playing , including circular breathing and other techniques .
a small 2010 study noted improvements in the asthma management of aboriginal teens when incorporating didgeridoo playing .
