The wakizashi (Japanese: 脇差 ) is one of the traditionally made Japanese swords ("") worn by the "samurai" in feudal Japan.
The "wakizashi" being worn together with the "katana" was the official sign that the wearer was a "samurai" or swordsman.
The "wakizashi" was one of several short swords available for use by "samurai" including the "yoroi tōshi", and the "chisa-katana".
The term "wakizashi" did not originally specify swords of any official blade length and was an abbreviation of "wakizashi no katana" ("sword thrust at one's side"); the term was applied to companion swords of all sizes.
It was not until the Edo period in 1638 when the rulers of Japan tried to regulate the types of swords and the social groups which were allowed to wear them that the lengths of "katana" and "wakizashi" were officially set.
Kanzan Satō, in his book titled "The Japanese Sword", notes that there did not seem to be any particular need for the "wakizashi" and suggests that the "wakizashi" may have become more popular than the "tantō" due to it being more suited for indoor fighting.
He mentions the custom of leaving the "katana" at the door of a castle or palace when entering while continuing to wear the "wakizashi" inside.
While the wearing of "katana" was limited to the samurai class, "wakizashi" of legal length ("kō-wakizashi") could be carried by the "chonin" class which included merchants.
"Wakizashi" were worn on the left side, secured to the waist sash ("").
