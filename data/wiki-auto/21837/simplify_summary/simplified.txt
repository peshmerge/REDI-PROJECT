the name combines the si prefix " nano-" from the ancient greek , " " , " dwarf "cope with the parent unit name " metre " selena selena " whenever the unit name is " metre " .
it can be written in scientific notation as 1 Ã— 10 m , and as simply metres .
nanotechnology , nanotechnology , or nanometres are used as a prefix for something other than a unit of measure measure .
the nanometre is often used to express dimensions on an atomic scale : the diameter of a helium atom is about 0.06 nm , and that of a ribosome is about 20 nm .
visible light ranges from around 400 to 700 nm .
the angstrom , which is equal to 0.1 nm , was used for these purposes , but is still used in other fields .
since the late 1980s , it has been used to describe typical feature sizes in successive generations of the itrs roadmap for miniaturization in the semiconductor industry .
the nanometre was formerly known as the millimicrometre -lrb- or , more commonly , the millimicron for short -rrb- since it is of a micronttered micrometrehend .
