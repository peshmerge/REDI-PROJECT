[CLS] the nano ##met ##re ( international spelling as used by the international bureau of weights and measures ; si symbol : nm ) or nano ##meter ( american spelling ) is a unit of length in the metric system , equal to one billion ##th ( short scale ) of a metre ( m ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when used as a prefix for something other than a unit of measure ( as in " nano ##sc ##ience " ) , nano refers to nano ##tech ##nology , or phenomena typically occurring on a scale of nano ##met ##res ( see nano ##scopic scale ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the nano ##met ##re is often used to express dimensions on an atomic scale : the diameter of a helium atom , for example , is about 0 . 06 nm , and that of a rib ##oso ##me is about 20 nm . [SEP]
[CLS] the nano ##met ##re is also commonly used to specify the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation near the visible part of the spectrum : visible light ranges from around 400 to 700 nm . [SEP]
[CLS] since the late 1980s , in usage ##s such as the 32 nm and the 22 nm semiconductor node , it has also been used to describe typical feature sizes in successive generations of the it ##rs road ##ma ##p for mini ##at ##uri ##zation in the semiconductor industry . [SEP]
