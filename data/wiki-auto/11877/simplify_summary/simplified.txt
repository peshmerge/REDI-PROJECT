while the traditional model of palaeontology , the phylogenetic model says that features evolved slowly without any direct association with speciation , the relatively newer and more controversial idea of punctuated equilibrium claims that major evolutionary changes can ' t happen over a gradual period but in localized , rare , rapid events of branching speciation .
punctuated gradualism is a variation of these models , between the phyletic gradualism model and the punctuated equilibrium model .
it states that speciation is not needed for a lineage to rapidly evolve from one equilibrium to another , but may show rapid transitions between long-stable states .
