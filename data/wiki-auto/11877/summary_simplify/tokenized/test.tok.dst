[CLS] gradual ##ism , from the latin " gr ##ad ##us " ( " step " ) , is a hypothesis , a theory or a ten ##et assuming that change comes about gradually or that variation is gradual in nature and happens over time as opposed to in large steps . [SEP]
[CLS] in the natural sciences , gradual ##ism is the theory which holds that profound change is the cumulative product of slow but continuous processes , often contrasted with cat ##ast ##rop ##hism . [SEP]
[CLS] the theory was proposed in 1795 by james hutton , a scottish geologist , and was later incorporated into charles l ##ye ##ll ' s theory of uniform ##itarian ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] using uniform ##itarian ##ism , which states that one cannot make an appeal to any force or phenomenon which cannot presently be observed ( see cat ##ast ##rop ##hism ) , darwin theo ##rized that the evolutionary process must occur gradually , not in salt ##ations , since salt ##ations are not presently observed , and extreme deviation ##s from the usual ph ##eno ##typic variation would be more likely to be selected against . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a term coined by stephen jay gould and nile ##s el ##dre ##dge to contrast with their model of pun ##ctuated equilibrium , which is gradual ##ist itself , but argues that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability ( called st ##asi ##s ) , which is pun ##ctuated by rare instances of branching evolution . [SEP]
[CLS] ph ##yle ##tic gradual ##ism is a model of evolution which theo ##rize ##s that most spec ##iation is slow , uniform and gradual . [SEP]
[CLS] when evolution occurs in this mode , it is usually by the steady transformation of a whole species into a new one ( through a process called ana ##genesis ) . [SEP]
[CLS] pun ##ctuated gradual ##ism is a micro ##ev ##ol ##ution ##ary hypothesis that refers to a species that has " relative st ##asi ##s over a considerable part of its total duration and underwent periodic , relatively rapid , mor ##ph ##olo ##gic change that did not lead to lineage branching " . [SEP]
[CLS] while the traditional model of pal ##ae ##ont ##ology , the phylogenetic model , states that features evolved slowly without any direct association with spec ##iation , the relatively newer and more controversial idea of pun ##ctuated equilibrium claims that major evolutionary changes don ' t happen over a gradual period but in localized , rare , rapid events of branching spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] pun ##ctuated gradual ##ism is considered to be a variation of these models , lying somewhere in between the ph ##yle ##tic gradual ##ism model and the pun ##ctuated equilibrium model . [SEP]
[CLS] it states that spec ##iation is not needed for a lineage to rapidly evolve from one equilibrium to another but may show rapid transitions between long - stable states . [SEP]
[CLS] in politics , gradual ##ism is the hypothesis that social change can be achieved in small , discrete inc ##rem ##ents rather than in abrupt strokes such as revolutions or uprising ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in socialist politics and within the socialist movement , the concept of gradual ##ism is frequently distinguished from reform ##ism , with the former insisting that short - term goals need to be formulated and implemented in such a way that they inevitably lead into long - term goals . [SEP]
[CLS] it is most commonly associated with the libertarian socialist concept of dual power and is seen as a middle way between reform ##ism and revolution ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] contra ##dict ##oria ##l gradual ##ism is the para ##con ##sis ##ten ##t treatment of fu ##zziness developed by lorenzo pena which regards true contradiction ##s as situations wherein a state of affairs enjoys only partial existence . [SEP]
[CLS] gradual ##ism in social change implemented through reform ##ist means is a moral principle to which the fabian society is committed . [SEP]
[CLS] in a more general way , reform ##ism is the assumption that gradual changes through and within existing institutions can ultimately change a society ' s fundamental economic system and political structures ; and that an accumulation of reforms can lead to the emergence of an entirely different economic system and form of society than present - day capitalism . [SEP]
[CLS] that hypothesis of social change grew out of opposition to revolutionary socialism , which contend ##s that revolution is necessary for fundamental structural changes to occur . [SEP]
