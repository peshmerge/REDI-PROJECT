[CLS] an assembly language ( or assemble ##r language ) , often abbreviated as ##m , is any low - level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture ' s machine code instructions . [SEP]
[CLS] assembly code is converted into ex ##ec ##utable machine code by a utility program referred to as an " assemble ##r " . [SEP]
[CLS] the conversion process is referred to as " assembly " , as in " ass ##em ##bling " the source code . [SEP]
[CLS] assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction ( 1 : 1 ) , but comments and statements that are assemble ##r directive ##s , macro ##s , and symbolic labels of program and memory locations are often also supported . [SEP]
[CLS] each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and sometimes to an operating system . [SEP]
[CLS] however , some assembly languages do not provide specific syntax for operating system calls , and most assembly languages can be used universally with any operating system , as the language provides access to all the real capabilities of the processor , upon which all system call mechanisms ultimately rest . [SEP]
[CLS] assembly language uses a mn ##emon ##ic to represent each low - level machine instruction or op ##code , typically also each architectural register , flag , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] depending on the architecture , these elements may also be combined for specific instructions or addressing modes using offset ##s or other data as well as fixed addresses . [SEP]
[CLS] many assemble ##rs offer additional mechanisms to facilitate program development , to control the assembly process , and to aid de ##bu ##gging . [SEP]
[CLS] the assemble ##r also calculate ##s constant expressions and resolve ##s symbolic names for memory locations and other entities . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemble ##rs , saving ted ##ious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications . [SEP]
[CLS] most assemble ##rs also include macro facilities for performing textual substitution – e . g . , to generate common short sequences of instructions as inline , instead of " called " sub ##rou ##tine ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] most of them are able to perform jump - instruction replacements ( long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps ) in any number of passes , on request . [SEP]
[CLS] others may even do simple rear ##rang ##ement or insertion of instructions , such as some assemble ##rs for ri ##sc architecture ##s that can help opt ##imi ##ze a sensible instruction scheduling to exploit the cpu pipeline as efficiently as possible . [SEP]
[CLS] like early programming languages such as fort ##ran , al ##gol , co ##bol and li ##sp , assemble ##rs have been available since the 1950s and the first generations of text based computer interfaces . [SEP]
[CLS] there have also been several classes of translators and semi automatic code generators with properties similar to both assembly and high level languages , with speed ##code as perhaps one of the better known examples . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , an instruction to add memory data to a register in a x ##86 - family processor might be cod ##ice _ 1 , in original " intel syntax " , whereas this would be written cod ##ice _ 2 in the " at & t syntax " used by the gnu assemble ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] a single assemble ##r may also have different modes in order to support variations in syn ##ta ##ctic forms as well as their exact semantic interpretations ( such as fa ##sm - syntax , ta ##sm - syntax , ideal mode , etc . , in the special case of x ##86 assembly programming ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in both cases , the assemble ##r must be able to determine the size of each instruction on the initial passes in order to calculate the addresses of subsequent symbols . [SEP]
[CLS] this means that if the size of an operation referring to an opera ##nd defined later depends on the type or distance of the opera ##nd , the assemble ##r will make a pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic estimate when first encounter ##ing the operation , and if necessary , pad it with one or more " no - operation " instructions in a later pass or the er ##rata . [SEP]
[CLS] in an assemble ##r with pee ##ph ##ole optimization , addresses may be rec ##al ##cula ##ted between passes to allow replacing pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic code with code tailored to the exact distance from the target . [SEP]
[CLS] the original reason for the use of one - pass assemble ##rs was speed of assembly – often a second pass would require re ##wind ##ing and re ##rea ##ding the program source on tape or re ##rea ##ding a deck of cards or punched paper tape . [SEP]
[CLS] the advantage of the multi - pass assemble ##r is that the absence of er ##rata makes the linking process ( or the program load if the assemble ##r directly produces ex ##ec ##utable code ) faster . [SEP]
[CLS] example : in the following code s ##ni ##ppet , a one - pass assemble ##r would be able to determine the address of the backward reference bk ##wd when ass ##em ##bling statement s ##2 , but would not be able to determine the address of the forward reference f ##wd when ass ##em ##bling the branch statement s ##1 ; indeed , f ##wd may be und ##efined . [SEP]
[CLS] these are translated by an assemble ##r into machine language instructions that can be loaded into memory and executed . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the instruction below tells an x ##86 / ia - 32 processor to move an immediate 8 - bit value into a register . [SEP]
[CLS] this binary computer code can be made more human - read ##able by expressing it in he ##xa ##de ##ci ##mal as follows . [SEP]
[CLS] assembly language for the 80 ##86 family provides the mn ##emon ##ic mo ##v ( an abbreviation of " move " ) for instructions such as this , so the machine code above can be written as follows in assembly language , complete with an ex ##pl ##ana ##tory comment if required , after the semi ##col ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##v al , 61 ##h ; load al with 97 decimal ( 61 he ##x ) [SEP]
[CLS] in some assembly languages ( including this one ) the same mn ##emon ##ic , such as mo ##v , may be used for a family of related instructions for loading , copying and moving data , whether these are immediate values , values in registers , or memory locations pointed to by values in registers or by immediate ( a / k / a direct ) addresses . [SEP]
[CLS] if the same mn ##emon ##ic is used for different instructions , that means that the mn ##emon ##ic corresponds to several different binary instruction codes , excluding data ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , for the x ##86 / ia - 32 cpu ##s , the intel assembly language syntax cod ##ice _ 6 represents an instruction that moves the contents of register " ah " into register " al " . [SEP]
[CLS] the he ##xa ##de ##ci ##mal form of this instruction is : the first byte , 88 ##h , identifies a move between a byte - sized register and either another register or memory , and the second byte , e ##0 ##h , is encoded ( with three bit - fields ) to specify that both opera ##nds are registers , the source is " ah " , and the destination is " al " . [SEP]
[CLS] in the first example , the opera ##nd cod ##ice _ 5 is a valid he ##xa ##de ##ci ##mal nu ##meric constant and is not a valid register name , so only the cod ##ice _ 3 instruction can be applicable . [SEP]
[CLS] assembly languages are always designed so that this sort of una ##mb ##ig ##uous ##ness is universally enforced by their syntax . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in the intel x ##86 assembly language , a he ##xa ##de ##ci ##mal constant must start with a nu ##meral digit , so that the he ##xa ##de ##ci ##mal number ' a ' ( equal to decimal ten ) would be written as cod ##ice _ 11 or cod ##ice _ 12 , not cod ##ice _ 9 , specifically so that it cannot appear to be the name of register " ah " . [SEP]
[CLS] transforming assembly language into machine code is the job of an assemble ##r , and the reverse can at least partially be achieved by a di ##sas ##se ##mble ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in some cases , an assemble ##r may provide " pseudo ##ins ##truct ##ions " ( essentially macro ##s ) which expand into several machine language instructions to provide commonly needed functionality . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , for a machine that lacks a " branch if greater or equal " instruction , an assemble ##r may provide a pseudo ##ins ##truct ##ion that expands to the machine ' s " set if less than " and " branch if zero ( on the result of the set instruction ) " . [SEP]
[CLS] most full - featured assemble ##rs also provide a rich macro language ( discussed below ) which is used by vendors and programmers to generate more complex code and data sequences . [SEP]
[CLS] since the information about pseudo ##ins ##truct ##ions and macro ##s defined in the assemble ##r environment is not present in the object program , a di ##sas ##se ##mble ##r cannot rec ##ons ##truct the macro and pseudo ##ins ##truct ##ion in ##vocation ##s but can only di ##sas ##se ##mble the actual machine instructions that the assemble ##r generated from those abstract assembly - language entities . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , since comments in the assembly language source file are ignored by the assemble ##r and have no effect on the object code it generates , a di ##sas ##se ##mble ##r is always completely unable to recover source comments . [SEP]
[CLS] while most general - purpose computers are able to carry out essentially the same functionality , the ways they do so differ ; the corresponding assembly languages reflect these differences . [SEP]
[CLS] multiple sets of mn ##emon ##ics or assembly - language syntax may exist for a single instruction set , typically instant ##iated in different assemble ##r programs . [SEP]
[CLS] because intel claimed copyright on its assembly language mn ##emon ##ics ( on each page of their documentation published in the 1970s and early 1980s , at least ) , some companies that independently produced cpu ##s compatible with intel instruction sets invented their own mn ##emon ##ics . [SEP]
[CLS] ( it is questionable whether such copyright ##s can be valid , and later cpu companies such as am ##d and cy ##rix republished intel ' s x ##86 / ia - 32 instruction mn ##emon ##ics exactly with neither permission nor legal penalty . ) [SEP]
[CLS] it is doubtful whether in practice many people who programmed the v ##20 and v ##30 actually wrote in nec ' s assembly language rather than intel ' s ; since any two assembly languages for the same instruction set architecture are iso ##morphic ( somewhat like english and pig latin ) , there is no requirement to use a manufacturer ' s own published assembly language with that manufacturer ' s products . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a large degree of diversity in the way the authors of assemble ##rs cat ##ego ##rize statements and in the nomenclature that they use . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , a mn ##emon ##ic is a symbolic name for a single ex ##ec ##utable machine language instruction ( an op ##code ) , and there is at least one op ##code mn ##emon ##ic defined for each machine language instruction . [SEP]
[CLS] opera ##nds can be immediate ( value coded in the instruction itself ) , registers specified in the instruction or implied , or the addresses of data located elsewhere in storage . [SEP]
[CLS] some di ##sas ##se ##mble ##rs recognize this and will deco ##de the instruction as . [SEP]
[CLS] some assemble ##rs also support simple built - in macro - instructions that generate two or more machine instructions . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , with some z ##80 assemble ##rs the instruction is recognized to generate followed by . [SEP]
[CLS] mn ##emon ##ics are arbitrary symbols ; in 1985 the ieee published standard 69 ##4 for a uniform set of mn ##emon ##ics to be used by all assemble ##rs . [SEP]
[CLS] there are instructions used to define data elements to hold data and variables . [SEP]
[CLS] these instructions can also define whether the data is available to outside programs ( programs assembled separately ) or only to the program in which the data section is defined . [SEP]
[CLS] assembly directive ##s , also called pseudo - op ##codes , pseudo - operations or pseudo - ops , are commands given to an assemble ##r " directing it to perform operations other than ass ##em ##bling instructions . " . [SEP]
[CLS] another common use of pseudo - ops is to reserve storage areas for run - time data and optional ##ly initial ##ize their contents to known values . [SEP]
[CLS] some assemble ##rs , such as nas ##m , provide flexible symbol management , letting programmers manage different names ##pace ##s , automatically calculate offset ##s within data structures , and assign labels that refer to literal values or the result of simple computation ##s performed by the assemble ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] ju ##dic ##ious commenting is essential in assembly language programs , as the meaning and purpose of a sequence of binary machine instructions can be difficult to determine . [SEP]
[CLS] the " raw " ( un ##com ##ment ##ed ) assembly language generated by compiler ##s or di ##sas ##se ##mble ##rs is quite difficult to read when changes must be made . [SEP]
[CLS] many assemble ##rs support " pre ##de ##fine ##d macro ##s " , and others support " programmer - defined " ( and repeatedly re - def ##ina ##ble ) macro ##s involving sequences of text lines in which variables and constant ##s are embedded . [SEP]
[CLS] the macro definition is most commonly a mixture of assemble ##r statements , e . g . , directive ##s , symbolic machine instructions , and template ##s for assemble ##r statements . [SEP]
[CLS] when the assemble ##r processes such a statement , it replaces the statement with the text lines associated with that macro , then processes them as if they existed in the source code file ( including , in some assemble ##rs , expansion of any macro ##s existing in the replacement text ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in assembly language , the term " macro " represents a more comprehensive concept than it does in some other contexts , such as in the c programming language , where its # define directive typically is used to create short single line macro ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] assemble ##r macro instructions , like macro ##s in pl / i and some other languages , can be lengthy " programs " by themselves , executed by interpretation by the assemble ##r during assembly . [SEP]
[CLS] since macro ##s can have ' short ' names but expand to several or indeed many lines of code , they can be used to make assembly language programs appear to be far shorter , requiring fewer lines of source code , as with higher level languages . [SEP]
[CLS] they can also be used to add higher levels of structure to assembly programs , optional ##ly introduce embedded de ##bu ##gging code via parameters and other similar features . [SEP]
[CLS] some assemble ##rs include quite sophisticated macro languages , incorporating such high - level language elements as optional parameters , symbolic variables , conditional ##s , string manipulation , and arithmetic operations , all usable during the execution of a given macro , and allowing macro ##s to save context or exchange information . [SEP]
[CLS] this could be used to generate record - style data structures or " un ##roll ##ed " loops , for example , or could generate entire algorithms based on complex parameters . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , a " sort " macro could accept the specification of a complex sort key and generate code crafted for that specific key , not needing the run - time tests that would be required for a general procedure interpreting the specification . [SEP]
[CLS] an organization using assembly language that has been heavily extended using such a macro suite can be considered to be working in a higher - level language , since such programmers are not working with a computer ' s lowest - level conceptual elements . [SEP]
[CLS] the target machine would translate this to its native code using a macro assemble ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] macro ##s were used to custom ##ize large scale software systems for specific customers in the main ##frame era and were also used by customer personnel to satisfy their employers ' needs by making specific versions of manufacturer operating systems . [SEP]
[CLS] this was done , for example , by systems programmers working with ibm ' s conversation ##al monitor system / virtual machine ( v ##m / cm ##s ) and with ibm ' s " real time transaction processing " add - on ##s , customer information control system ci ##cs , and ac ##p / t ##pf , the airline / financial system that began in the 1970s and still runs many large computer reservation systems ( cr ##s ) and credit card systems today . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also possible to use solely the macro processing abilities of an assemble ##r to generate code written in completely different languages , for example , to generate a version of a program in co ##bol using a pure macro assemble ##r program containing lines of co ##bol code inside assembly time operators ins ##tructing the assemble ##r to generate arbitrary code . [SEP]
[CLS] the user specifies options by coding a series of assemble ##r macro ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this is because , as was realized in the 1960s , the concept of " macro processing " is independent of the concept of " assembly " , the former being in modern terms more word processing , text processing , than generating object code . [SEP]
[CLS] note that unlike certain previous macro processors inside assemble ##rs , the c prep ##ro ##ces ##sor is not turing - complete because it lacks the ability to either loop or " go to " , the latter allowing programs to loop . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the power of macro processing , it fell into di ##sus ##e in many high level languages ( major exceptions being c , c + + and pl / i ) while remaining a perennial for assemble ##rs . [SEP]
[CLS] macro parameter substitution is strictly by name : at macro processing time , the value of a parameter is textual ##ly substituted for its name . [SEP]
[CLS] the most famous class of bugs resulting was the use of a parameter that itself was an expression and not a simple name when the macro writer expected a name . [SEP]
[CLS] to avoid any possible ambiguity , users of macro processors can parent ##hes ##ize formal parameters inside macro definitions , or caller ##s can parent ##hes ##ize the input parameters . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest example of this approach was in the concept - 14 macro set , originally proposed by dr . harlan mills ( march 1970 ) , and implemented by marvin ke ##ssler at ibm ' s federal systems division , which extended the s / 360 macro assemble ##r with if / else / end ##if and similar control flow blocks . [SEP]
[CLS] this was a way to reduce or eliminate the use of got ##o operations in assembly code , one of the main factors causing spaghetti code in assembly language . [SEP]
[CLS] a curious design was a - natural , a " stream - oriented " assemble ##r for 80 ##80 / z ##80 processors from whites ##mith ##s ltd . ( developers of the unix - like id ##ris operating system , and what was reported to be the first commercial c compiler ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the language was classified as an assemble ##r , because it worked with raw machine elements such as op ##codes , registers , and memory references ; but it incorporated an expression syntax to indicate execution order . [SEP]
[CLS] parentheses and other special symbols , along with block - oriented structured programming construct ##s , controlled the sequence of the generated instructions . [SEP]
[CLS] in spite of that , they are still being developed and applied in cases where resource constraints or peculiar ##ities in the target system ' s architecture prevent the effective use of higher - level languages . [SEP]
[CLS] assembly languages were not available at the time when the stored - program computer was introduced . [SEP]
[CLS] in late 1948 , the electronic delay storage automatic cal ##cula ##tor ( eds ##ac ) had an assemble ##r ( named " initial orders " ) integrated into its boots ##tra ##p program . [SEP]
[CLS] reports on the eds ##ac introduced the term " assembly " for the process of combining fields into an instruction word . [SEP]
[CLS] the burroughs mc ##p ( 1961 ) was the first computer for which an operating system was not developed entirely in assembly language ; it was written in executive systems problem oriented language ( es ##pol ) , an al ##gol dialect . [SEP]
[CLS] many commercial applications were written in assembly language as well , including a large amount of the ibm main ##frame software written by large corporations . [SEP]
[CLS] this was because these systems had severe resource constraints , imposed id ##ios ##yn ##cratic memory and display architecture ##s , and provided limited , bug ##gy system services . [SEP]
[CLS] a psychological factor may have also played a role : the first generation of micro ##com ##put ##er programmers retained a hobby ##ist , " wires and pl ##iers " attitude . [SEP]
[CLS] in a more commercial context , the biggest reasons for using assembly language were minimal b ##lo ##at ( size ) , minimal overhead , greater speed , and reliability . [SEP]
[CLS] assembly language was used to get the best performance out of the sega saturn , a console that was notorious ##ly challenging to develop and program games for . [SEP]
[CLS] assembly language has long been the primary development language for many popular home computers of the 1980s and 1990s ( such as the ms ##x , sinclair z ##x spectrum , commodore 64 , commodore amiga , and atari st ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this was in large part because interpreted basic dialects on these systems offered insufficient execution speed , as well as insufficient facilities to take full advantage of the available hardware on these systems . [SEP]
[CLS] some compiler ##s available for the radio shack tr ##s - 80 and its successors had the capability to combine inline assembly source with high - level program statements . [SEP]
[CLS] although assembly language has specific niche uses where it is important ( see below ) , there are other tools for optimization . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of speed optimization , modern opt ##imi ##zing compiler ##s are claimed to render high - level languages into code that can run as fast as hand - written assembly , despite the counter - examples that can be found . [SEP]
[CLS] the complexity of modern processors and memory sub - systems makes effective optimization increasingly difficult for compiler ##s , as well as assembly programmers . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , increasing processor performance has meant that most cpu ##s sit idle most of the time , with delays caused by predictable bottle ##neck ##s such as cache misses , i / o operations and pa ##ging . [SEP]
[CLS] this has made raw code execution speed a non - issue for many programmers . [SEP]
[CLS] such fundamental topics as binary arithmetic , memory allocation , stack processing , character set encoding , interrupt processing , and compiler design would be hard to study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level . [SEP]
[CLS] since a computer ' s behavior is fundamentally defined by its instruction set , the logical way to learn such concepts is to study an assembly language . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , studying a single assembly language is sufficient to learn : i ) the basic concepts ; ii ) to recognize situations where the use of assembly language might be appropriate ; and iii ) to see how efficient ex ##ec ##utable code can be created from high - level languages . [SEP]
