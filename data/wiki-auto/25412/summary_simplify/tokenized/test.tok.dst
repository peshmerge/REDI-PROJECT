[CLS] rock and roll ( often written as rock & roll or rock ' n ' roll ) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the united states during the late 1940s and early 1950s from musical styles such as gospel , jump blues , jazz , boogie woo ##gie , and rhythm and blues , along with country music . [SEP]
[CLS] while elements of what was to become rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s , the genre did not acquire its name until 1954 . [SEP]
[CLS] according to greg ko ##t , " rock and roll " refers to a style of popular music originating in the u . s . in the 1950s prior to its development by the mid - 1960s into " the more encompassing international style known as " rock music , " though the latter also continued to be known as rock and roll . " [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both african - american and white american teenagers enjoyed the music . [SEP]
[CLS] it went on to spawn various genres , often without the initially characteristic back ##beat , that are now more commonly called simply " rock music " or " rock " . [SEP]
[CLS] the phrase " rocking and rolling " originally described the movement of a ship on the ocean , but was used by the early twentieth century , both to describe the spiritual fe ##r ##vor of black church rituals and as a sexual analogy . [SEP]
[CLS] various gospel , blues and swing recordings used the phrase before it became used more frequently – but still intermittent ##ly – in the 1940s , on recordings and in reviews of what became known as " rhythm and blues " music aimed at a black audience . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1943 , the " rock and roll inn " in south merchant ##ville , new jersey , was established as a music venue . [SEP]
[CLS] the origins of rock and roll have been fiercely debated by commentators and historians of music . [SEP]
[CLS] there is general agreement that it arose in the southern united states – a region that would produce most of the major early rock and roll acts – through the meeting of various influences that embodied a merging of the african musical tradition with european instrumentation . [SEP]
[CLS] the migration of many former slaves and their descendants to major urban centers such as st . louis , memphis , new york city , detroit , chicago , cleveland , and buffalo ( see : second great migration ( african american ) ) meant that black and white residents were living in close proximity in larger numbers than ever before , and as a result heard each other ' s music and even began to em ##ulate each other ' s fashion ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] radio stations that made white and black forms of music available to both groups , the development and spread of the gram ##ophone record , and african - american musical styles such as jazz and swing which were taken up by white musicians , aided this process of " cultural collision " . [SEP]
[CLS] one particularly noteworthy example of a jazz song with rec ##og ##ni ##za ##bly rock and roll elements is big joe turner with pianist pete johnson ' s 1939 single " roll ' em pete " , which is regarded as an important precursor of rock and roll . [SEP]
[CLS] during and immediately after world war ii , with shortages of fuel and limitations on audiences and available personnel , large jazz bands were less economical and tended to be replaced by smaller combo ##s , using guitars , bass and drums . [SEP]
[CLS] in the same period , particularly on the west coast and in the midwest , the development of jump blues , with its guitar riff ##s , prominent beats and shouted lyrics , pre ##fi ##gur ##ed many later developments . [SEP]
[CLS] rock ' n ' roll " , keith richards proposes that chuck berry developed his brand of rock and roll by trans ##po ##sing the familiar two - note lead line of jump blues piano directly to the electric guitar , creating what is instantly recognizable as rock guitar . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , country boogie and chicago electric blues supplied many of the elements that would be seen as characteristic of rock and roll . [SEP]
[CLS] inspired by electric blues , chuck berry introduced an aggressive guitar sound to rock and roll , and established the electric guitar as its centre ##piece , adapting his rock band instrumentation from the basic blues band instrumentation of a lead guitar , second chord instrument , bass and drums . [SEP]
[CLS] rock and roll arrived at a time of considerable technological change , soon after the development of the electric guitar , amplifier and microphone , and the 45 rpm record . [SEP]
[CLS] there were also changes in the record industry , with the rise of independent labels like atlantic , sun and chess servicing niche audiences and a similar rise of radio stations that played their music . [SEP]
[CLS] because the development of rock and roll was an evolutionary process , no single record can be identified as una ##mb ##ig ##uously " the first " rock and roll record . [SEP]
[CLS] in terms of its wide cultural impact across society in the us and elsewhere , bill haley ' s " rock around the clock " , recorded in april 1954 but not a commercial success until the following year , is generally recognized as an important milestone , but it was preceded by many recordings from earlier decades in which elements of rock and roll can be clearly disc ##ern ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] " rock ##abi ##lly " usually ( but not exclusively ) refers to the type of rock and roll music which was played and recorded in the mid - 1950s primarily by white singers such as elvis presley , carl perkins , johnny cash , and jerry lee lewis , who drew mainly on the country roots of the music . [SEP]
[CLS] elvis presley was greatly influenced and incorporated his style of music with some of the greatest african american musicians like bb king , chuck berry and fat ##s domino . [SEP]
[CLS] his style of music combined with black influences created controversy during a turbulent time in history . [SEP]
[CLS] many other popular rock and roll singers of the time , such as fat ##s domino and little richard , came out of the black rhythm and blues tradition , making the music attractive to white audiences , and are not usually classed as " rock ##abi ##lly " . [SEP]
[CLS] although only a minor hit when first released , when used in the opening sequence of the movie " black ##board jungle " a year later , it set the rock and roll boom in motion . [SEP]
[CLS] if everything that came before laid the ground ##work , " rock around the clock " introduced the music to a global audience . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1956 , the arrival of rock ##abi ##lly was under ##lined by the success of songs like " f ##ols ##om prison blues " by johnny cash , " blue sued ##e shoes " by perkins and the no . [SEP]
[CLS] later rock ##abi ##lly acts , particularly performing songwriters like buddy holly , would be a major influence on british invasion acts and particularly on the song writing of the beatles and through them on the nature of later rock music . [SEP]
[CLS] doo - wo ##p was one of the most popular forms of 1950s rhythm and blues , often compared with rock and roll , with an emphasis on multi - part vocal harmonies and meaningless backing lyrics ( from which the genre later gained its name ) , which were usually supported with light instrumentation . [SEP]
[CLS] its origins were in african - american vocal groups of the 1930s and 40 ##s , such as the ink spots and the mills brothers , who had enjoyed considerable commercial success with arrangements based on close harmonies . [SEP]
[CLS] they were followed by 1940s r & b vocal acts such as the orioles , the ravens and the clover ##s , who injected a strong element of traditional gospel and , increasingly , the energy of jump blues . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1954 , as rock and roll was beginning to emerge , a number of similar acts began to cross over from the r & b charts to mainstream success , often with added hon ##king brass and saxophone , with the crows , the penguins , the el dora ##dos and the tu ##rba ##ns all scoring major hits . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the subsequent explosion in records from doo wo ##p acts in the later ' 50 ##s , many failed to chart or were one - hit wonders . [SEP]
[CLS] exceptions included the platt ##ers , with songs including " the great pretend ##er " ( 1955 ) and the coaster ##s with humorous songs like " ya ##ke ##ty ya ##k " ( 1958 ) , both of which ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the era . [SEP]
[CLS] towards the end of the decade there were increasing numbers of white , particularly italian - american , singers taking up doo wo ##p , creating all - white groups like the mystic ##s and dion and the belmont ##s and racial ##ly integrated groups like the del - vikings and the imp ##ala ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] through the late 1940s and early 1950s , r & b music had been gaining a stronger beat and a wilder style , with artists such as fat ##s domino and johnny otis speeding up the tempo ##s and increasing the back ##beat to great popularity on the ju ##ke joint circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] before the efforts of freed and others , black music was taboo on many white - owned radio outlets , but artists and producers quickly recognized the potential of rock and roll . [SEP]
[CLS] some of presley ' s early recordings were covers of black rhythm and blues or blues songs , such as " that ' s all right " ( a count ##rified arrangement of a blues number ) , " baby let ' s play house " , " law ##dy miss claw ##dy " and " hound dog " . [SEP]
[CLS] songwriting credits were often unreliable ; many publishers , record executives , and even managers ( both white and black ) would insert their name as a composer in order to collect royalty checks . [SEP]
[CLS] covers were customary in the music industry at the time ; it was made particularly easy by the compulsory license provision of united states copyright law ( still in effect ) . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the first relevant successful covers was w ##yn ##oni ##e harris ' s transformation of roy brown ' s 1947 original jump blues hit " good rocking tonight " into a more show ##y rocker and the louis prima rocker " oh babe " in 1950 , as well as amos mil ##burn ' s cover of what may have been the first white rock and roll record , hard ##rock gunter ' s " birmingham bounce " in 1949 . [SEP]
[CLS] famously , pat boone recorded san ##iti ##zed versions of songs recorded by the likes of fat ##s domino , little richard , the flaming ##os and ivory joe hunter . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , bill haley ' s incomplete ##ly bow ##dler ##ized cover of " shake , rattle and roll " transformed big joe turner ' s humorous and ra ##cy tale of adult love into an energetic teen dance number , while georgia gibbs replaced et ##ta james ' s tough , sarcastic vocal in " roll with me , henry " ( covered as " dance with me , henry " ) with a per ##kie ##r vocal more appropriate for an audience unfamiliar with the song to which james ' s song was an answer , hank ballard ' s " work with me , annie " . [SEP]
[CLS] elvis ' rock and roll version of " hound dog " , taken mainly from a version recorded by the pop band freddie bell and the bell ##boys , was very different from the blues shout ##er that big mama thornton had recorded four years earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1959 , the deaths of buddy holly , the big bop ##per and ritchie vale ##ns in a plane crash ( february 1959 ) , the departure of elvis for service in the united states army ( march 1958 ) , the retirement of little richard to become a preacher ( october 1957 ) , the scandal surrounding jerry lee lewis ' marriage to his thirteen - year - old cousin ( may 1958 ) , the arrest of chuck berry ( december 1959 ) , and the breaking of the pay ##ola scandal imp ##lica ##ting major figures , including alan freed , in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs ( november 1959 ) , gave a sense that the initial phase of rock and roll had come to an end . [SEP]
[CLS] marketing frequently emphasized the physical looks of the artist rather than the music , contributing to the successful careers of ricky nelson , tommy sands , bobby ve ##e and the philadelphia trio of bobby ry ##dell , frankie avalon and fabian , who all became " teen idols . " [SEP]
[CLS] some music historians have also pointed to important and innovative developments that built on rock and roll in this period , including multi ##tra ##ck recording , developed by les paul , the electronic treatment of sound by such inn ##ova ##tors as joe meek , and the " wall of sound " productions of phil spec ##tor , continued des ##eg ##re ##gation of the charts , the rise of surf music , garage rock and the twist dance cr ##az ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] it shared a common language , had been exposed to american culture through the station ##ing of troops in the country , and shared many social developments , including the emergence of distinct youth sub - cultures , which in britain included the teddy boys and the rocker ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the ski ##ffle cr ##az ##e , led by lo ##nni ##e done ##gan , ut ##ilised amateur ##ish versions of american folk songs and encouraged many of the subsequent generation of rock and roll , folk , r & b and beat musicians to start performing . [SEP]
[CLS] both movies contained the bill haley & his comets hit " rock around the clock " , which first entered the british charts in early 1955 – four months before it reached the us pop charts – topped the british charts later that year and again in 1956 , and helped identify rock and roll with teenage del ##in ##que ##ncy . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial response of the british music industry was to attempt to produce copies of american records , recorded with session musicians and often fronted by teen idols . [SEP]
[CLS] other leading acts included billy fury , joe brown , and johnny kidd & the pirates , whose 1960 hit song " sha ##kin ' all over " became a rock and roll standard . [SEP]
[CLS] about the same time , a british blues scene developed , initially led by pu ##rist blues followers such as alexis ko ##rner and cyril davies who were directly inspired by american musicians such as robert johnson , muddy waters and howl ##in ' wolf . [SEP]
[CLS] many groups moved towards the beat music of rock and roll and rhythm and blues from ski ##ffle , like the quarry ##men who became the beatles , producing a form of rock and roll revival ##ism that carried them and many other groups to national success from about 1963 and to international success from 1964 , known in america as the british invasion . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both african - american and white american teens enjoyed the music . [SEP]
[CLS] the lyrics of rock and roll songs described events and conflicts that most listeners could relate to through personal experience . [SEP]
[CLS] topics such as sex that had generally been considered taboo began to appear in rock and roll lyrics . [SEP]
[CLS] rock and roll appeared at a time when racial tensions in the united states were entering a new phase , with the beginnings of the civil rights movement for des ##eg ##re ##gation , leading to the u . s . supreme court ruling that abolished the policy of " separate but equal " in 1954 , but leaving a policy which would be extremely difficult to enforce in parts of the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] the coming together of white youth audiences and black music in rock and roll inevitably provoked strong white racist reactions within the us , with many whites condemning its breaking down of barriers based on color . [SEP]
[CLS] many observers saw rock and roll as herald ##ing the way for des ##eg ##re ##gation , in creating a new form of music that encouraged racial cooperation and shared experience . [SEP]
[CLS] many authors have argued that early rock and roll was instrumental in the way both white and black teenagers identified themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] several rock historians have claimed that rock and roll was one of the first music genres to define an age group . [SEP]
[CLS] rock and roll is often identified with the emergence of teen culture among the first baby boom ##er generation , who had greater relative af ##fl ##uen ##ce and leisure time and adopted rock and roll as part of a distinct sub ##culture . [SEP]
[CLS] in " there ' s no romance in rock and roll " from " true life romance " ( 1956 ) , a defiant teen dates a rock and roll - loving boy but drops him for one who likes traditional adult music — to her parents ' relief . [SEP]
[CLS] in britain , where postwar prosperity was more limited , rock and roll culture became attached to the pre - existing teddy boy movement , largely working class in origin , and eventually to the rocker ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] rock and roll has been seen as re ##ori ##enting popular music toward a youth market , as in dion and the belmont ##s ' " a teenager in love " ( 1960 ) . [SEP]
