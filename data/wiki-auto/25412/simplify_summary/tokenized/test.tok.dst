[CLS] rock and roll ( often written as rock & roll or rock ' n ' roll ) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the united states during the late 1940s and early 1950s from musical styles such as gospel , jump blues , jazz , boogie woo ##gie , and rhythm and blues , along with country music . [SEP]
[CLS] while elements of what was to become rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s , the genre did not acquire its name until 1954 . [SEP]
[CLS] according to greg ko ##t , " rock and roll " refers to a style of popular music originating in the u . s . in the 1950s prior to its development by the mid - 1960s into " the more encompassing international style known as " rock music , " though the latter also continued to be known as rock and roll . " [SEP]
[CLS] for the purpose of differentiation , this article deals with the first definition . [SEP]
[CLS] in the earliest rock and roll styles , either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument , but these instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] the beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accent ##uated back ##beat , which is almost always provided by a s ##nare drum . [SEP]
[CLS] classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars ( one lead , one rhythm ) , a double bass or string bass or ( after the mid - 1950s ) an electric bass guitar , and a drum kit . [SEP]
[CLS] beyond simply a musical style , rock and roll , as seen in movies , in fan magazines , and on television , influenced lifestyle ##s , fashion , attitudes , and language . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both african - american and white american teenagers enjoyed the music . [SEP]
[CLS] it went on to spawn various genres , often without the initially characteristic back ##beat , that are now more commonly called simply " rock music " or " rock " . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " rock and roll " is defined by " en ##cy ##cl ##op ##æ ##dia brit ##ann ##ica " as the music that originated in the mid - 1950s and later developed " into the more encompassing international style known as rock music " . [SEP]
[CLS] the term is sometimes also used as synonymous with " rock music " and is defined as such in some di ##ction ##aries . [SEP]
[CLS] the phrase " rocking and rolling " originally described the movement of a ship on the ocean , but was used by the early twentieth century , both to describe the spiritual fe ##r ##vor of black church rituals and as a sexual analogy . [SEP]
[CLS] various gospel , blues and swing recordings used the phrase before it became used more frequently – but still intermittent ##ly – in the 1940s , on recordings and in reviews of what became known as " rhythm and blues " music aimed at a black audience . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1934 , the song " rock and roll " by the bo ##swell sisters appeared in the film " transatlantic merry - go - round " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1942 , " billboard " magazine columnist ma ##uri ##e oro ##den ##ker started to use the term " rock - and - roll " to describe upbeat recordings such as " rock me " by sister rose ##tta tha ##rp ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1943 , the " rock and roll inn " in south merchant ##ville , new jersey , was established as a music venue . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1951 , cleveland , ohio , disc jockey alan freed began playing this music style while popular ##izing the phrase to describe it . [SEP]
[CLS] the origins of rock and roll have been fiercely debated by commentators and historians of music . [SEP]
[CLS] there is general agreement that it arose in the southern united states – a region that would produce most of the major early rock and roll acts – through the meeting of various influences that embodied a merging of the african musical tradition with european instrumentation . [SEP]
[CLS] the migration of many former slaves and their descendants to major urban centers such as st . louis , memphis , new york city , detroit , chicago , cleveland , and buffalo ( see : second great migration ( african american ) ) meant that black and white residents were living in close proximity in larger numbers than ever before , and as a result heard each other ' s music and even began to em ##ulate each other ' s fashion ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] radio stations that made white and black forms of music available to both groups , the development and spread of the gram ##ophone record , and african - american musical styles such as jazz and swing which were taken up by white musicians , aided this process of " cultural collision " . [SEP]
[CLS] the immediate roots of rock and roll lay in the rhythm and blues , then called " race music " , and country music of the 1940s and 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] particularly significant influences were jazz , blues , gospel , country , and folk . [SEP]
[CLS] commentators differ in their views of which of these forms were most important and the degree to which the new music was a re - branding of african - american rhythm and blues for a white market , or a new hybrid of black and white forms . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1930s , jazz , and particularly swing , both in urban - based dance bands and blues - influenced country swing ( jimmie rodgers , moon mu ##lli ##can and other similar singers ) , were among the first music to present african - american sounds for a predominantly white audience . [SEP]
[CLS] one particularly noteworthy example of a jazz song with rec ##og ##ni ##za ##bly rock and roll elements is big joe turner with pianist pete johnson ' s 1939 single " roll ' em pete " , which is regarded as an important precursor of rock and roll . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1940s saw the increased use of b ##lar ##ing horns ( including saxophone ##s ) , shouted lyrics and boogie woo ##gie beats in jazz - based music . [SEP]
[CLS] during and immediately after world war ii , with shortages of fuel and limitations on audiences and available personnel , large jazz bands were less economical and tended to be replaced by smaller combo ##s , using guitars , bass and drums . [SEP]
[CLS] in the same period , particularly on the west coast and in the midwest , the development of jump blues , with its guitar riff ##s , prominent beats and shouted lyrics , pre ##fi ##gur ##ed many later developments . [SEP]
[CLS] in the documentary film " hail ! [SEP]
[CLS] rock ' n ' roll " , keith richards proposes that chuck berry developed his brand of rock and roll by trans ##po ##sing the familiar two - note lead line of jump blues piano directly to the electric guitar , creating what is instantly recognizable as rock guitar . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , country boogie and chicago electric blues supplied many of the elements that would be seen as characteristic of rock and roll . [SEP]
[CLS] inspired by electric blues , chuck berry introduced an aggressive guitar sound to rock and roll , and established the electric guitar as its centre ##piece , adapting his rock band instrumentation from the basic blues band instrumentation of a lead guitar , second chord instrument , bass and drums . [SEP]
[CLS] rock and roll arrived at a time of considerable technological change , soon after the development of the electric guitar , amplifier and microphone , and the 45 rpm record . [SEP]
[CLS] there were also changes in the record industry , with the rise of independent labels like atlantic , sun and chess servicing niche audiences and a similar rise of radio stations that played their music . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the realization that relatively affluent white teenagers were listening to this music that led to the development of what was to be defined as rock and roll as a distinct genre . [SEP]
[CLS] because the development of rock and roll was an evolutionary process , no single record can be identified as una ##mb ##ig ##uously " the first " rock and roll record . [SEP]
[CLS] contenders for the title of " first rock and roll record " include sister rose ##tta tha ##rp ##e ' s " strange things happening every day " ( 1944 ) , " the fat man " by fat ##s domino ( 1949 ) , gore ##e carter ' s " rock awhile " ( 1949 ) , jimmy preston ' s " rock the joint " ( 1949 ) , which was later covered by bill haley & his comets in 1952 , " rocket 88 " by jackie br ##ens ##ton and his delta cats ( ike turner and his band the kings of rhythm ) , recorded by sam phillips for sun records in march 1951 . [SEP]
[CLS] in terms of its wide cultural impact across society in the us and elsewhere , bill haley ' s " rock around the clock " , recorded in april 1954 but not a commercial success until the following year , is generally recognized as an important milestone , but it was preceded by many recordings from earlier decades in which elements of rock and roll can be clearly disc ##ern ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] other artists with early rock and roll hits included chuck berry , bo did ##dley , little richard , jerry lee lewis , and gene vincent . [SEP]
[CLS] chuck berry ' s 1955 classic " maybe ##llen ##e " in particular features a distorted electric guitar solo with warm over ##tones created by his small valve amplifier . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the use of distortion was pre ##date ##d by electric blues guitarists such as joe hill louis , guitar slim , willie johnson of howl ##in ' wolf ' s band , and pat hare ; the latter two also made use of distorted power chords in the early 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] also in 1955 , bo did ##dley introduced the " bo did ##dley beat " and a unique electric guitar style , influenced by african and afro - cuban music and in turn influencing many later artists . [SEP]
[CLS] " rock ##abi ##lly " usually ( but not exclusively ) refers to the type of rock and roll music which was played and recorded in the mid - 1950s primarily by white singers such as elvis presley , carl perkins , johnny cash , and jerry lee lewis , who drew mainly on the country roots of the music . [SEP]
[CLS] elvis presley was greatly influenced and incorporated his style of music with some of the greatest african american musicians like bb king , chuck berry and fat ##s domino . [SEP]
[CLS] his style of music combined with black influences created controversy during a turbulent time in history . [SEP]
[CLS] many other popular rock and roll singers of the time , such as fat ##s domino and little richard , came out of the black rhythm and blues tradition , making the music attractive to white audiences , and are not usually classed as " rock ##abi ##lly " . [SEP]
[CLS] bill flag ##g who is a connecticut resident , began referring to his mix of hill ##bill ##y and rock ' n ' roll music as rock ##abi ##lly around 1953 . [SEP]
[CLS] his song " guitar rock " is considered as classic rock ##abi ##lly . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 1954 , elvis presley recorded the regional hit " that ' s all right " at sam phillips ' sun studio in memphis . [SEP]
[CLS] three months earlier , on april 12 , 1954 , bill haley & his comets recorded " rock around the clock " . [SEP]
[CLS] although only a minor hit when first released , when used in the opening sequence of the movie " black ##board jungle " a year later , it set the rock and roll boom in motion . [SEP]
[CLS] the song became one of the biggest hits in history , and fr ##en ##zie ##d teens flock ##ed to see haley and the comets perform it , causing riots in some cities . [SEP]
[CLS] " rock around the clock " was a breakthrough for both the group and for all of rock and roll music . [SEP]
[CLS] if everything that came before laid the ground ##work , " rock around the clock " introduced the music to a global audience . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1956 , the arrival of rock ##abi ##lly was under ##lined by the success of songs like " f ##ols ##om prison blues " by johnny cash , " blue sued ##e shoes " by perkins and the no . 1 hit " heartbreak hotel " by presley . [SEP]
[CLS] for a few years it became the most commercially successful form of rock and roll . [SEP]
[CLS] later rock ##abi ##lly acts , particularly performing songwriters like buddy holly , would be a major influence on british invasion acts and particularly on the song writing of the beatles and through them on the nature of later rock music . [SEP]
[CLS] doo - wo ##p was one of the most popular forms of 1950s rhythm and blues , often compared with rock and roll , with an emphasis on multi - part vocal harmonies and meaningless backing lyrics ( from which the genre later gained its name ) , which were usually supported with light instrumentation . [SEP]
[CLS] its origins were in african - american vocal groups of the 1930s and 40 ##s , such as the ink spots and the mills brothers , who had enjoyed considerable commercial success with arrangements based on close harmonies . [SEP]
[CLS] they were followed by 1940s r & b vocal acts such as the orioles , the ravens and the clover ##s , who injected a strong element of traditional gospel and , increasingly , the energy of jump blues . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1954 , as rock and roll was beginning to emerge , a number of similar acts began to cross over from the r & b charts to mainstream success , often with added hon ##king brass and saxophone , with the crows , the penguins , the el dora ##dos and the tu ##rba ##ns all scoring major hits . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the subsequent explosion in records from doo wo ##p acts in the later ' 50 ##s , many failed to chart or were one - hit wonders . [SEP]
[CLS] exceptions included the platt ##ers , with songs including " the great pretend ##er " ( 1955 ) and the coaster ##s with humorous songs like " ya ##ke ##ty ya ##k " ( 1958 ) , both of which ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the era . [SEP]
[CLS] towards the end of the decade there were increasing numbers of white , particularly italian - american , singers taking up doo wo ##p , creating all - white groups like the mystic ##s and dion and the belmont ##s and racial ##ly integrated groups like the del - vikings and the imp ##ala ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] doo - wo ##p would be a major influence on vocal surf music , soul and early mer ##sey ##beat , including the beatles . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the earliest white rock and roll hits were covers or partial re - writes of earlier black rhythm and blues or blues songs . [SEP]
[CLS] through the late 1940s and early 1950s , r & b music had been gaining a stronger beat and a wilder style , with artists such as fat ##s domino and johnny otis speeding up the tempo ##s and increasing the back ##beat to great popularity on the ju ##ke joint circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] before the efforts of freed and others , black music was taboo on many white - owned radio outlets , but artists and producers quickly recognized the potential of rock and roll . [SEP]
[CLS] some of presley ' s early recordings were covers of black rhythm and blues or blues songs , such as " that ' s all right " ( a count ##rified arrangement of a blues number ) , " baby let ' s play house " , " law ##dy miss claw ##dy " and " hound dog " . [SEP]
[CLS] the racial lines , however , are rather more clouded by the fact that some of these r & b songs originally recorded by black artists had been written by white songwriters , such as the team of jerry lei ##ber and mike st ##oll ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] songwriting credits were often unreliable ; many publishers , record executives , and even managers ( both white and black ) would insert their name as a composer in order to collect royalty checks . [SEP]
[CLS] covers were customary in the music industry at the time ; it was made particularly easy by the compulsory license provision of united states copyright law ( still in effect ) . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the first relevant successful covers was w ##yn ##oni ##e harris ' s transformation of roy brown ' s 1947 original jump blues hit " good rocking tonight " into a more show ##y rocker and the louis prima rocker " oh babe " in 1950 , as well as amos mil ##burn ' s cover of what may have been the first white rock and roll record , hard ##rock gunter ' s " birmingham bounce " in 1949 . [SEP]
[CLS] the most notable trend , however , was white pop covers of black r & b numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] the more familiar sound of these covers may have been more pal ##atable to white audiences , there may have been an element of prejudice , but labels aimed at the white market also had much better distribution networks and were generally much more profitable . [SEP]
[CLS] famously , pat boone recorded san ##iti ##zed versions of songs recorded by the likes of fat ##s domino , little richard , the flaming ##os and ivory joe hunter . [SEP]
[CLS] later , as those songs became popular , the original artists ' recordings received radio play as well . [SEP]
[CLS] the cover versions were not necessarily straightforward imitation ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , bill haley ' s incomplete ##ly bow ##dler ##ized cover of " shake , rattle and roll " transformed big joe turner ' s humorous and ra ##cy tale of adult love into an energetic teen dance number , while georgia gibbs replaced et ##ta james ' s tough , sarcastic vocal in " roll with me , henry " ( covered as " dance with me , henry " ) with a per ##kie ##r vocal more appropriate for an audience unfamiliar with the song to which james ' s song was an answer , hank ballard ' s " work with me , annie " . [SEP]
[CLS] elvis ' rock and roll version of " hound dog " , taken mainly from a version recorded by the pop band freddie bell and the bell ##boys , was very different from the blues shout ##er that big mama thornton had recorded four years earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] other white artists who recorded cover versions of rhythm & blues songs included gale storm smiley lewis ' " i hear you knock ##in ' " , the diamonds the glad ##iol ##as ' " little dar ##lin ' " and frankie l ##ym ##on & the teenagers ' " why do fools fall in love ? " , [SEP]
[CLS] , the crew cuts the chords ' " sh - boom " and nap ##py brown ' s " don ' t be angry " , the fountain sisters the jewels ' " hearts of stone " and the maguire sisters the moon ##gl ##ows ' " sincerely " . [SEP]
[CLS] some commentators have suggested a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1959 , the deaths of buddy holly , the big bop ##per and ritchie vale ##ns in a plane crash ( february 1959 ) , the departure of elvis for service in the united states army ( march 1958 ) , the retirement of little richard to become a preacher ( october 1957 ) , the scandal surrounding jerry lee lewis ' marriage to his thirteen - year - old cousin ( may 1958 ) , the arrest of chuck berry ( december 1959 ) , and the breaking of the pay ##ola scandal imp ##lica ##ting major figures , including alan freed , in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs ( november 1959 ) , gave a sense that the initial phase of rock and roll had come to an end . [SEP]
[CLS] during the late 1950s and early 1960s , the raw ##er sounds of elvis presley , gene vincent , jerry lee lewis and buddy holly were commercially superseded by a more polished , commercial style of rock and roll . [SEP]
[CLS] marketing frequently emphasized the physical looks of the artist rather than the music , contributing to the successful careers of ricky nelson , tommy sands , bobby ve ##e and the philadelphia trio of bobby ry ##dell , frankie avalon and fabian , who all became " teen idols . " [SEP]
[CLS] some music historians have also pointed to important and innovative developments that built on rock and roll in this period , including multi ##tra ##ck recording , developed by les paul , the electronic treatment of sound by such inn ##ova ##tors as joe meek , and the " wall of sound " productions of phil spec ##tor , continued des ##eg ##re ##gation of the charts , the rise of surf music , garage rock and the twist dance cr ##az ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] surf rock in particular , noted for the use of rev ##er ##b - drenched guitars , became one of the most popular forms of american rock of the 1960s . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1950s , britain was well placed to receive american rock and roll music and culture . [SEP]
[CLS] it shared a common language , had been exposed to american culture through the station ##ing of troops in the country , and shared many social developments , including the emergence of distinct youth sub - cultures , which in britain included the teddy boys and the rocker ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] tr ##ad jazz became popular , and many of its musicians were influenced by related american styles , including boogie woo ##gie and the blues . [SEP]
[CLS] the ski ##ffle cr ##az ##e , led by lo ##nni ##e done ##gan , ut ##ilised amateur ##ish versions of american folk songs and encouraged many of the subsequent generation of rock and roll , folk , r & b and beat musicians to start performing . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time british audiences were beginning to encounter american rock and roll , initially through films including " black ##board jungle " ( 1955 ) and " rock around the clock " ( 1955 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] both movies contained the bill haley & his comets hit " rock around the clock " , which first entered the british charts in early 1955 – four months before it reached the us pop charts – topped the british charts later that year and again in 1956 , and helped identify rock and roll with teenage del ##in ##que ##ncy . [SEP]
[CLS] american rock and roll acts such as elvis presley , little richard , buddy holly , chuck berry and carl perkins thereafter became major forces in the british charts . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial response of the british music industry was to attempt to produce copies of american records , recorded with session musicians and often fronted by teen idols . [SEP]
[CLS] more grassroots british rock and roller ##s soon began to appear , including wee willie harris and tommy steele . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period american rock and roll remained dominant ; however , in 1958 britain produced its first " authentic " rock and roll song and star , when cliff richard reached number 2 in the charts with " move it " . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time , tv shows such as " six - five special " and " oh boy ! " [SEP]
[CLS] promoted the careers of british rock and roller ##s like marty wilde and adam faith . [SEP]
[CLS] cliff richard and his backing band , the shadows , were the most successful home grown rock and roll based acts of the era . [SEP]
[CLS] other leading acts included billy fury , joe brown , and johnny kidd & the pirates , whose 1960 hit song " sha ##kin ' all over " became a rock and roll standard . [SEP]
[CLS] as interest in rock and roll was beginning to sub ##side in america in the late 1950s and early 1960s , it was taken up by groups in major british urban centres like liverpool , manchester , birmingham , and london . [SEP]
[CLS] about the same time , a british blues scene developed , initially led by pu ##rist blues followers such as alexis ko ##rner and cyril davies who were directly inspired by american musicians such as robert johnson , muddy waters and howl ##in ' wolf . [SEP]
[CLS] many groups moved towards the beat music of rock and roll and rhythm and blues from ski ##ffle , like the quarry ##men who became the beatles , producing a form of rock and roll revival ##ism that carried them and many other groups to national success from about 1963 and to international success from 1964 , known in america as the british invasion . [SEP]
[CLS] groups that followed the beatles included the beat - influenced freddie and the dreamer ##s , wayne fontana and the mind ##ben ##ders , herman ' s hermit ##s and the dave clark five . [SEP]
[CLS] early british rhythm and blues groups with more blues influences include the animals , the rolling stones , and the yard ##birds . [SEP]
[CLS] rock and roll influenced lifestyle ##s , fashion , attitudes , and language . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both african - american and white american teens enjoyed the music . [SEP]
[CLS] many early rock and roll songs dealt with issues of cars , school , dating , and clothing . [SEP]
[CLS] the lyrics of rock and roll songs described events and conflicts that most listeners could relate to through personal experience . [SEP]
[CLS] topics such as sex that had generally been considered taboo began to appear in rock and roll lyrics . [SEP]
[CLS] this new music tried to break boundaries and express emotions that people were actually feeling but had not talked about . [SEP]
[CLS] an awakening began to take place in american youth culture . [SEP]
[CLS] in the crossover of african - american " race music " to a growing white youth audience , the popular ##ization of rock and roll involved both black performers reaching a white audience and white musicians performing african - american music . [SEP]
[CLS] rock and roll appeared at a time when racial tensions in the united states were entering a new phase , with the beginnings of the civil rights movement for des ##eg ##re ##gation , leading to the u . s . supreme court ruling that abolished the policy of " separate but equal " in 1954 , but leaving a policy which would be extremely difficult to enforce in parts of the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] the coming together of white youth audiences and black music in rock and roll inevitably provoked strong white racist reactions within the us , with many whites condemning its breaking down of barriers based on color . [SEP]
[CLS] many observers saw rock and roll as herald ##ing the way for des ##eg ##re ##gation , in creating a new form of music that encouraged racial cooperation and shared experience . [SEP]
[CLS] many authors have argued that early rock and roll was instrumental in the way both white and black teenagers identified themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] several rock historians have claimed that rock and roll was one of the first music genres to define an age group . [SEP]
[CLS] it gave teenagers a sense of belonging , even when they were alone . [SEP]
[CLS] rock and roll is often identified with the emergence of teen culture among the first baby boom ##er generation , who had greater relative af ##fl ##uen ##ce and leisure time and adopted rock and roll as part of a distinct sub ##culture . [SEP]
[CLS] this involved not just music , absorbed via radio , record buying , ju ##ke ##box ##es and tv programs like " american bands ##tan ##d " , but also extended to film , clothes , hair , cars and motor ##bi ##kes , and distinctive language . [SEP]
[CLS] the youth culture exemplified by rock and roll was a recurring source of concern for older generations , who worried about juvenile del ##in ##que ##ncy and social rebellion , particularly because to a large extent rock and roll culture was shared by different racial and social groups . [SEP]
[CLS] in america , that concern was conveyed even in youth cultural artifacts such as comic books . [SEP]
[CLS] in " there ' s no romance in rock and roll " from " true life romance " ( 1956 ) , a defiant teen dates a rock and roll - loving boy but drops him for one who likes traditional adult music — to her parents ' relief . [SEP]
[CLS] in britain , where postwar prosperity was more limited , rock and roll culture became attached to the pre - existing teddy boy movement , largely working class in origin , and eventually to the rocker ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] rock and roll has been seen as re ##ori ##enting popular music toward a youth market , as in dion and the belmont ##s ' " a teenager in love " ( 1960 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] from its early 1950s beginnings through the early 1960s , rock and roll spawned new dance cr ##az ##es including the twist . [SEP]
[CLS] teenagers found the sync ##opa ##ted back ##beat rhythm especially suited to rev ##iving big band - era ji ##tter ##bu ##g dancing . [SEP]
[CLS] sock hop ##s , school and church gym dances , and home basement dance parties became the rage , and american teens watched dick clark ' s " american bands ##tan ##d " to keep up on the latest dance and fashion styles . [SEP]
[CLS] from the mid - 1960s on , as " rock and roll " was rebranded as " rock , " later dance genres followed , leading to funk , disco , house , techno , and hip hop . [SEP]
