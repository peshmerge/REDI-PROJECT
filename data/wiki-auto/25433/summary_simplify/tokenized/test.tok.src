[CLS] other democratic initiatives he opposed in the 1960s included the food stamp program , raising the minimum wage , and the establishment of the peace corps . [SEP]
[CLS] this " a time for choosing " speech was not enough to turn around the fa ##lter ##ing gold ##water campaign , but it was the key event that established reagan ' s national political visibility . [SEP]

[CLS] one of reagan ' s greatest frustration ##s in office was the controversy of capital punishment , which he strongly supported . [SEP]

[CLS] reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like - minded organizations such as the american conservative union , which became key components of his political base , while ford was considered a more moderate republican . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan ' s campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager john sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the in ##ev ##ita ##bility of ford ' s likely nomination . [SEP]
[CLS] the texas campaign lent renewed hope to reagan , when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the may 1 primary , with four more awaiting at the state convention . [SEP]
[CLS] much of the credit for that victory came from the work of three co - chair ##men , including ernest angelo , the mayor of midland , and ray barn ##hart of houston , whom reagan as president would appoint in 1981 as director of the federal highway administration . [SEP]
[CLS] ford would go on to lose the 1976 presidential election to the democratic nominee , jimmy carter . [SEP]

[CLS] during his presidency , reagan pursued policies that reflected his personal belief in individual freedom ; brought changes domestically , both to the u . s . economy and expanded military ; and contributed to the end of the cold war . [SEP]
[CLS] as president , reagan kept a diary in which he commented on daily occurrences of his presidency and his views on the issues of the day . [SEP]
[CLS] in his inaugural address ( which reagan himself wrote ) , he addressed the country ' s economic mala ##ise , arguing : " in this present crisis , government is not the solution to our problems ; government is the problem . " [SEP]
[CLS] during his term in office , reagan campaigned vigorously to restore organized prayer to the schools , first as a moment of prayer and later as a moment of silence . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1981 , reagan became the first president to propose a constitutional amendment on school prayer . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan ' s election reflected an opposition to the 1962 supreme court case " eng ##el v . vital ##e " , prohibiting state officials from composing an official state prayer and requiring that it be recited in the public schools . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1984 , reagan again raised the issue , asking congress " why can ' t the freedom to acknowledge god be enjoyed again by children in every school ##room across this land ? " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1985 , reagan expressed his disappointment that the supreme court ruling still banned a moment of silence for public schools , and said that efforts to reins ##ti ##tute prayer in public schools were " an up ##hill battle " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1987 reagan renewed his call for congress to support voluntary prayer in schools and end " the expulsion of god from america ' s classrooms . " [SEP]
[CLS] on march 30 , 1981 ( shortly into his new administration ) , reagan , his press secretary james brady , washington police officer thomas del ##aha ##nty , and secret service agent tim mccarthy were struck by gunfire from would - be assassin john hi ##nc ##kley jr . outside the washington hilton hotel . [SEP]
[CLS] although " close to death " upon arrival at george washington university hospital , reagan was stabilized in the emergency room , then underwent emergency ex ##pl ##ora ##tory surgery . [SEP]
[CLS] he recovered and was released from the hospital on april 11 , becoming the first serving u . s . president to survive being shot in an assassination attempt . [SEP]
[CLS] declaring the situation an emergency as described in the 1947 taft – hartley act , reagan stated that if the air traffic controllers " do not report for work within 48 hours , they have for ##feit ##ed their jobs and will be terminated . " [SEP]
[CLS] a leading reference work on public administration concluded , " the firing of pat ##co employees not only demonstrated a clear resolve by the president to take control of the bureaucracy , but it also sent a clear message to the private sector that unions no longer needed to be feared . " [SEP]
[CLS] he also supported returning the united states to some sort of gold standard , and successfully urged congress to establish the u . s . gold commission to study how one could be implemented . [SEP]
[CLS] citing the economic theories of arthur la ##ffer , reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base , offset ##ting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation , a theory that entered political discussion as the la ##ffer curve . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan ##omics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success , and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficit ##s and the national debt . [SEP]
[CLS] his policy of " peace through strength " resulted in a record peace ##time defense build ##up including a 40 % real increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1985 . [SEP]
[CLS] during reagan ' s presidency , federal income tax rates were lowered significantly with the signing of the economic recovery tax act of 1981 , which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70 % to 50 % over three years ( as part of a " 5 - 10 - 10 " plan ) , and the lowest bracket from 14 % to 11 % . [SEP]
[CLS] conversely , congress passed and reagan signed into law tax increases of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 ( te ##fra ) , social security , and the deficit reduction act of 1984 ( def ##ra ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the increase of the lowest tax bracket from 11 % to 15 % was more than offset by expansion of the personal exemption , standard de ##duction , and earned income tax credit . [SEP]
[CLS] however , federal income tax receipts increased from 1980 to 1989 , rising from $ 308 . 7 billion to $ 54 ##9 billion or an average annual rate of 8 . 2 % ( 2 . 5 % attributed to higher social security receipts ) , and federal out ##lay ##s grew at an annual rate of 7 . 1 % . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan ' s policies proposed that economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were low enough to spur investment , which would then lead to higher employment and wages . [SEP]
[CLS] questions arose whether reagan ' s policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty , and many poor and minority citizens viewed reagan as indifferent to their struggles . [SEP]
[CLS] these views were ex ##ace ##rba ##ted by the fact that reagan ' s economic regime ##n included freezing the minimum wage at $ 3 . 35 an hour , slash ##ing federal assistance to local governments by 60 % , cutting the budget for public housing and section 8 rent subsidies in half , and eliminating the anti ##po ##vert ##y community development block grant program . [SEP]
[CLS] the widening gap between the rich and poor had already begun during the 1970s before reagan ' s economic policies took effect . [SEP]
[CLS] along with reagan ' s 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on une ##ar ##ned income , he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to 20 % . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan later set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages , with both topping out at 28 % . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan is viewed as an anti ##ta ##x hero despite raising taxes eleven times over the course of his presidency , all in the name of fiscal responsibility . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan was opposed to government intervention , and he cut the budgets of non - military programs including med ##ica ##id , food stamps , federal education programs and the epa . [SEP]
[CLS] he protected en ##ti ##tlement programs such as social security and medicare , but his administration attempted to purge many people with disabilities from the social security disability rolls . [SEP]
[CLS] a minority of the critics of reagan ##omics also suggested that the policies partially influenced the stock market crash of 1987 , but there is no consensus regarding a single source for the crash . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to cover newly spawned federal budget deficit ##s , the united states borrowed heavily both domestically and abroad , raising the national debt from $ 99 ##7 billion to $ 2 . 85 trillion . [SEP]
[CLS] he re ##app ##oint ##ed paul vol ##cker as chairman of the federal reserve , and in 1987 he appointed mon ##eta ##rist alan greens ##pan to succeed him . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan ended the price controls on domestic oil that had contributed to the energy crises of 1973 – 74 and the summer of 1979 . [SEP]
[CLS] the price of oil subsequently dropped , and there were no fuel shortages like those in the 1970s . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan also fulfilled a 1980 campaign promise to repeal the wind ##fall profits tax in 1988 , which had previously increased dependence on foreign oil . [SEP]
[CLS] some economists , such as nobel prize winners milton friedman and robert mu ##nde ##ll , argue that reagan ' s tax policies in ##vi ##gor ##ated america ' s economy and contributed to the economic boom of the 1990s . [SEP]
[CLS] other economists , such as nobel prize winner robert solo ##w , argue that reagan ' s deficit ##s were a major reason his successor , george h . w . bush , rene ##ged on his and resort ##ed to raising taxes . [SEP]
[CLS] the program , project socrates , developed and demonstrated the means required for the united states to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantage — automated innovation . [SEP]
[CLS] to ensure that the united states acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation , reagan , during his second term , had an executive order drafted to create a new federal agency to implement the project socrates results on a nationwide basis . [SEP]
[CLS] however , reagan ' s term came to end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed , and the incoming bush administration , labeling project socrates as " industrial policy , " had it terminated . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1982 , he signed a bill extending the voting rights act for 25 years after a grass - roots lobbying and legislative campaign forced him to abandon his plan to ease that law ' s restrictions . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan escalated the cold war , accelerating a reversal from the policy of det ##ente that began during the carter administration , following the afghan sa ##ur revolution and subsequent soviet invasion . [SEP]
[CLS] he ordered a massive build ##up of the united states armed forces and implemented new policies that were directed towards the soviet union ; he revived the b - 1 lance ##r program that had been canceled by the carter administration , and he produced the mx missile . [SEP]

[CLS] reagan and the united kingdom ' s prime minister margaret thatcher both denounced the soviet union in ideological terms . [SEP]

[CLS] on march 3 , 1983 , he predicted that communism would collapse , stating , " communism is another sad , bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written . " [SEP]
[CLS] after soviet fighters downed korean air lines flight 00 ##7 near mon ##eron island on september 1 , 1983 , carrying 269 people , including georgia congressman larry mcdonald , reagan labeled the act a " massacre " and declared that the soviets had turned " against the world and the moral pre ##ce ##pts which guide human relations among people everywhere . " [SEP]
[CLS] the reagan administration responded to the incident by suspend ##ing all soviet passenger air service to the united states , and dropped several agreements being negotiated with the soviets , wounding them financially . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result of the shoot ##down , and the cause of ka ##l 00 ##7 ' s going as ##tray thought to be ina ##de ##qua ##cies related to its navigation ##al system , reagan announced on september 16 , 1983 , that the global positioning system would be made available for civilian use , free of charge , once completed in order to ave ##rt similar navigation ##al errors in future . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in a break from the carter administration policy of arm ##ing taiwan under the taiwan relations act , reagan also agreed with the communist government in china to reduce the sale of arms to taiwan . [SEP]
[CLS] president reagan ' s covert action program has been given credit for assisting in ending the soviet occupation of afghanistan , though some of the united states funded armament ##s introduced then would later pose a threat to u . s . troops in the 2001 war in afghanistan . [SEP]
[CLS] in one instance , in 1982 , this practice enabled the government to identify and purge communists from its ministries , and to virtually eliminate the pro - soviet infrastructure in iran . [SEP]
[CLS] in march 1983 , reagan introduced the strategic defense initiative , a defense project that would have used ground - and space - based systems to protect the united states from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles . [SEP]
[CLS] there was much disbelief surrounding the program ' s scientific feasibility , leading opponents to dub sd ##i " star wars " and argue that its technological objective was una ##tta ##ina ##ble . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets became concerned about the possible effects sd ##i would have ; leader yuri and ##rop ##ov said it would put " the entire world in jeopardy . " [SEP]
[CLS] for those reasons , david ge ##rgen , former aide to president reagan , believes that in retro ##sp ##ect , sd ##i haste ##ned the end of the cold war . [SEP]
[CLS] though supported by leading american conservatives who argued that reagan ' s foreign policy strategy was essential to protecting u . s . security interests , critics labeled the administration ' s foreign policy initiatives as aggressive and imperial ##istic , and chi ##ded them as " warm ##ong ##ering . " [SEP]
[CLS] the administration was also heavily criticized for backing anti - communist leaders accused of severe human rights violations , such as hiss ##ene ha ##bre of chad and e ##fra ##in rios mont ##t of guatemala . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 16 months ( 1982 – 1983 ) mont ##t was president of guatemala , the guatemala ##n military was accused of genocide for massacre ##s of members of the ix ##il people and other indigenous groups . [SEP]

[CLS] a formal appeal from the organisation of eastern caribbean states ( o ##ec ##s ) led to the intervention of u . s . forces ; president reagan also cited an allegedly regional threat posed by a soviet - cuban military build - up in the caribbean and concern for the safety of several hundred american medical students at st . george ' s university as adequate reasons to invade . [SEP]

[CLS] reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on january 20 , 1985 , in a private ceremony at the white house . [SEP]

[CLS] in response to concerns about the increasing crack epidemic , reagan began the war on drugs campaign in 1982 , a policy led by the federal government to reduce the illegal drug trade . [SEP]
[CLS] though nixon had previously declared a war on drugs , reagan advocated more militant policies . [SEP]
[CLS] he said that " drugs were menacing our society " and promised to fight for drug - free schools and workplace ##s , expanded drug treatment , stronger law enforcement and drug inter ##dict ##ion efforts , and greater public awareness . [SEP]

[CLS] from the late 1960s onward , the american public grew increasingly vocal in its opposition to apartheid policy of the white - minority government of south africa , and in its insistence that the u . s . impose economic and diplomatic sanctions on south africa . [SEP]
[CLS] the strength of the anti - apartheid opposition surged during reagan ' s first term in office as its component di ##sin ##ves ##tment from south africa movement , which had been in existence for quite some years , gained critical mass following in the united states , particularly on college campuses and among mainline protestant denominations . [SEP]
[CLS] president reagan was opposed to dive ##sti ##ture because , as he wrote in a letter to sammy davis jr . , it " would hurt the very people we are trying to help and would leave us no contact within south africa to try and bring influence to bear on the government " . [SEP]
[CLS] he also noted the fact that the " american - owned industries there employ more than 80 , 000 blacks " and that their employment practices were " very different from the normal south african customs " . [SEP]
[CLS] as an alternative strategy for opposing apartheid , the reagan administration developed a policy of constructive engagement with the south african government as a means of encouraging it to gradually move away from apartheid . [SEP]
[CLS] it was part of a larger initiative designed to foster peaceful economic development and political change throughout southern africa . [SEP]
[CLS] this policy , however , eng ##end ##ered much public criticism and renewed calls for the imp ##osition of string ##ent sanctions . [SEP]
[CLS] afterward , reagan reiterated that his administration and " all america " opposed apartheid , and said , " the debate . . . was not whether or not to oppose apartheid but , instead , how best to oppose it and how best to bring freedom to that troubled country . " [SEP]
[CLS] relations between libya and the united states under president reagan were continually contentious , beginning with the gulf of sid ##ra incident in 1981 ; by 1982 , libyan leader mu ##am ##mar gaddafi was considered by the cia to be , along with ussr leader leonid br ##ez ##hn ##ev and cuban leader fide ##l castro , part of a group known as the " un ##hol ##y trinity " and was also labeled as " our international public enemy number one " by a cia official .

[CLS] the attack was designed to halt gaddafi ' s " ability to export terrorism , " offering him " incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior . " [SEP]
[CLS] the president addressed the nation from the oval office after the attacks had commenced , stating , " when our citizens are attacked or abused anywhere in the world on the direct orders of hostile regimes , we will respond so long as i ' m in this office . " [SEP]
[CLS] by a vote of 79 in favor to 28 against with 33 abs ##ten ##tions , the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 41 / 38 which " condemn ##s the military attack per ##pet ##rated against the socialist people ' s libyan arab jam ##ah ##iri ##ya on april 15 , 1986 , which constitutes a violation of the charter of the united nations and of international law .

[CLS] the act made it illegal to knowing ##ly hire or recruit illegal immigrants , required employers to at ##test to their employees ' immigration status , and granted amnesty to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the united states before january 1 , 1982 , and had lived in the country continuously .

[CLS] upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished statue of liberty , reagan said , " the legal ##ization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows , without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society .

[CLS] until the early 1980s , the united states had relied on the qu ##ali ##tative superiority of its weapons to essentially fright ##en the soviets , but the gap had been narrowed . [SEP]
[CLS] although the soviet union did not accelerate military spending after president reagan ' s military build ##up , their large military expenses , in combination with collect ##iv ##ized agriculture and in ##ef ##fi ##cie ##nt planned manufacturing , were a heavy burden for the soviet economy . [SEP]
[CLS] second , he was committed ( thanks to his california friend edward teller , the father of the hydrogen bomb ) to building a defense against nuclear weapons , called the strategic defense initiative ( sd ##i , nicknamed " star wars " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] second , reagan explained his strategy was an arms build ##up that would leave the soviets far behind , with no choice but to negotiate arms reduction . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan appreciated the revolutionary change in the direction of the soviet policy with mikhail go ##rba ##chev , and shifted to diplomacy , with a view to encourage the soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements . [SEP]
[CLS] he and go ##rba ##chev held four summit conferences between 1985 and 1988 : the first in geneva , switzerland , the second in reykjavik , iceland , the third in washington , d . c . , and the fourth in moscow . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan believed that if he could persuade the soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech , this would lead to reform and the end of communism . [SEP]
[CLS] to the astonishment of the world , and the cha ##grin of reagan ' s most conservative supporters , they agreed to ab ##olis ##h all nuclear weapons . [SEP]
[CLS] speaking at the berlin wall on june 12 , 1987 , reagan challenged go ##rba ##chev to go further , saying " general secretary go ##rba ##chev , if you seek peace , if you seek prosperity for the soviet union and eastern europe , if you seek liberal ##ization , come here to this gate ! [SEP]
[CLS] later , in november 1989 , east german authorities began allowing citizens to pass freely through border checkpoint ##s , and began di ##sman ##tling the wall the following june ; its demolition was completed in 1992 . [SEP]

[CLS] dea ##ver was given assurance ##s by a german head of protocol that no war criminals were buried there . [SEP]
[CLS] what neither dea ##ver nor other administration officials initially realized was that many germans drew a distinction between the regular ss , who typically were composed of nazi true believers , and the wa ##ffen - ss which were attached to military units and composed of con ##script ##ed soldiers . [SEP]
[CLS] as the controversy brew ##ed in april 1985 , reagan issued a statement that called the nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery as themselves " victims , " a designation which ignited a stir over whether reagan had e ##qua ##ted the ss men to victims of the holocaust . [SEP]
[CLS] pat buchanan , reagan ' s director of communications , argued that the president did not e ##qua ##te the ss members with the actual holocaust , but as victims of the ideology of nazis ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] now strongly urged to cancel the visit , the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to chancellor ko ##hl . [SEP]
[CLS] on may 5 , 1985 , president reagan and chancellor ko ##hl first visited the site of the former nazi bergen - bel ##sen concentration camp and then the bit ##burg cemetery where , along with two military generals , they did place a wreath . [SEP]

[CLS] early in his presidency , reagan appointed clarence m . pendleton jr . , of san diego as the first african american to chair the united states commission on civil rights . [SEP]
[CLS] pendleton tried to steer the commission into a conservative direction in line with reagan ' s views on social and civil rights policy during his tenure from 1981 until his sudden death in 1988 . [SEP]
[CLS] pendleton soon aroused the ir ##e of many civil rights advocates and feminist ##s when he rid ##ic ##uled the comparable worth proposal as being " lo ##oney tunes . " [SEP]
[CLS] on april 13 , 1992 , reagan was assaulted by an anti - nuclear protest ##er during a lunch ##eon speech while accepting an award from the national association of broadcasters in las vegas . [SEP]

[CLS] dr . lawrence alt ##man of " the new york times " noted that " the line between mere forget ##fulness and the beginning of alzheimer ' s can be fuzzy " , and all four of reagan ' s white house doctors said that they saw no evidence of alzheimer ' s while he was president . [SEP]
[CLS] daniel rug ##e , a ne ##uro ##sur ##ge ##on who served as physician to the president from 1981 to 1985 , said that he never detected signs of the disease while speaking almost every day with reagan . [SEP]
[CLS] after being thrown from a horse in mexico , a sub ##dur ##al hem ##ato ##ma was found and surgical ##ly treated later in the year . [SEP]
[CLS] nancy reagan , citing what doctors told her , asserted that her husband ' s 1989 fall haste ##ned the onset of alzheimer ' s disease , although acute brain injury has not been con ##clusive ##ly proven to accelerate alzheimer ' s or dementia . [SEP]
[CLS] he remained active , however ; he took walks through parks near his home and on beaches , played golf regularly , and until 1999 he often went to his office in nearby century city . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan ' s public appearances became much less frequent with the progression of the disease , and as a result , his family decided that he would live in quiet semi - isolation with his wife nancy . [SEP]
[CLS] she told cnn ' s larry king in 2001 that very few visitors were allowed to see her husband because she felt that " ronnie would want people to remember him as he was . " [SEP]
[CLS] after her husband ' s diagnosis and death , nancy reagan became a stem - cell research advocate , asserting that it could lead to a cure for alzheimer ' s . [SEP]

[CLS] supporters have pointed to a more efficient and prosperous economy as a result of reagan ' s economic policies , foreign policy triumph ##s including a peaceful end to the cold war , and a restoration of american pride and morale . [SEP]
[CLS] proponents say that he had an una ##bate ##d and passionate love for the united states which restored faith in the american dream , after a decline in american confidence and self - respect under jimmy carter ' s perceived weak leadership , particularly during the iran hostage crisis , as well as his gloom ##y , dr ##ear ##y outlook for the future of the united states during the 1980 election .

[CLS] despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy , many conservative and liberal scholars agree that reagan has been the most influential president since franklin d . roosevelt , leaving his imprint on american politics , diplomacy , culture , and economics through his effective communication and pr ##ag ##matic com ##promising .
