the texas campaign helped reagan , when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the may 1 primary , with four more awaiting at the state convention .
the credit for that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen , including ernest angelo , the mayor of midland , and ray barnhart of houston , whom reagan as president would appoint in 1981 as director of the federal highway administration .
reagan 's concession speech emphasized the dangers of nuclear war and the threat posed by the soviet union .

from the late 1960s onward , the american public grew increasingly vocal in its opposition to apartheid policy of the white-minority government of south africa .
the strong anti-apartheid opposition grew during reagan 's first term in office as its component disinvestment from south africa movement , which gained critical mass following in the united states , particularly on college campuses and among mainline protestant denominations .

he also noted that the " american-owned industries there employ more than 80,000 blacks " and that their employment practices were " very different from the normal south african customs " .

many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and , ultimately , if they choose , they may become americans .
reagan also said , " the employer sanctions program is the keystone and major element .

until the early 1980s , the united states had relied on the qualitative superiority of its weapons to frighten the soviets , but the gap had been narrowed .
the soviet union did not make military spending more than the military cost the war .
these factors helped a stagnant soviet economy during gorbachev 's rule .
reagan was deeply committed first to the abolition of nuclear weapons , worldwide .
he was the father of the hydrogen bombarded to build a defense against nuclear weapons .
in his famous speech in 1983 he outlined his strategy for victory .
reagan explained his strategy was an arms buildup that would leave the soviets far behind , with no choice but to negotiate arms reduction .
reagan appreciated the change in the direction of the soviet policy with mikhail gorbachev , and shifted to diplomacy , with a view to encourage the soviet leader to pursue substantial arms agreements .
he and gorbachev held four summit conferences between 1985 and 1988 : the first in geneva , switzerland , the second in reykjavik , iceland , the third in washington , d . c . , and the fourth in moscow .

the ss had many germans drew a distinction between the regular ss , who typically composed of nazi true believers , and the waffen-ss which were attached to military units and composed of conscripted soldiers .
reagan issued a statement that called the nazi soldiers buried in that cemetery as themselves " victims " .
pat buchanan , reagan 's director of communications , argued that the president did not equate the ss members with the actual holocaust , but as victims of the ideology of nazism .
now strongly urged to cancel the visit , the president responded that it would be wrong to back down on a promise he had made to chancellor kohl .
on may 5,1985 , president reagan and chancellor kohl first visited the site of the former nazi bergen-belsen concentration camp and then the bitburg cemetery where , along with two military generals , they did place a wreath .

she was strongly opposed by civil and women 's rights groups , and by senate democrats .
early in his presidency , reagan appointed clarence m . pendleton , jr . as the first african-american to chair the united states commission on civil rights .

pendleton soon aroused the ire of many civil rights advocates and feminists .
reagan was assaulted by an anti-nuclear protester during luncheon speech on april 13,1992 .
the protester , richard springer , smashed a 2-foot-high £ 60 cm diameter 30-pound pound pound statue of an eagle that the broadcasters had given the former president .

following his arrest on assault charges , a secret service spokesman could not explain how springer got past the agents who guarded reagan 's life at all times .

stahl came close to reporting that reagan was senile , but at the end of the meeting , he regained his alertness .
all four of reagan 's white house doctors said that they saw no evidence of alzheimer 's while he was president .
