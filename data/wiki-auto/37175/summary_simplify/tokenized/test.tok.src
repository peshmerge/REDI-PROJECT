[CLS] he was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry in 1968 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1925 he arrived at a correction to the de ##by ##e - hu ##cke ##l theory of electro ##ly ##tic solutions , to specify brown ##ian movement of ions in solution , and during 1926 published it . [SEP]
[CLS] he traveled to zurich , where peter de ##by ##e was teaching , and confronted de ##by ##e , telling him his theory was wrong . [SEP]
[CLS] at j ##hu he had to teach freshman classes in chemistry , and it quickly became apparent that , while he was a genius at developing theories in physical chemistry , he had little talent for teaching . [SEP]
[CLS] on leaving j ##hu , he accepted a position ( involving the teaching of statistical mechanics to graduate students in chemistry ) at brown university in providence , rhode island , where it became clear that he was no better at teaching advanced students than freshmen , but he made significant contributions to statistical mechanics and the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mics . [SEP]
[CLS] the only graduate student who could really understand his lectures on electro ##ly ##te systems , , worked under him and eventually joined him on the yale chemistry faculty . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1933 , when the great depression limited brown ' s ability to support a faculty member who was only useful as a researcher and not a teacher , he was let go by brown , being hired after a trip to europe by yale university , where he remained for most of the rest of his life , retiring in 1972 . [SEP]
[CLS] his research at brown was concerned mainly with the effects on diffusion of temperature gradient ##s , and produced the on ##sa ##ger reciprocal relations , a set of equations published in 1929 and , in an expanded form , in 1931 , in statistical mechanics whose importance went un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed for many years . [SEP]
[CLS] however , their value became apparent during the decades following world war ii , and by 1968 they were considered important enough to gain on ##sa ##ger that year ' s nobel prize in chemistry . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1933 , just before taking up the position at yale , on ##sa ##ger traveled to austria to visit electro ##chemist hans fa ##lke ##nh ##age ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] at yale , an embarrassing situation occurred : he had been hired as a postdoctoral fellow , but it was discovered that he had never received a ph . d . [SEP]
[CLS] while he had submitted an outline of his work in reciprocal relations to the norwegian institute of technology , they had decided it was too incomplete to qualify as a doctoral dissertation . [SEP]
[CLS] he was told that he could submit one of his published papers to the yale faculty as a dissertation , but insisted on doing a new research project instead . [SEP]
[CLS] his dissertation , entitled , " solutions of the math ##ieu equation of period 4 pi and certain related functions " , was beyond the comprehension of the chemistry and physics faculty , and only when some members of the mathematics department , including the chairman , insisted that the work was good enough that " they " would grant the doctorate if the chemistry department would not , was he granted a ph . d . in chemistry in 1935 . [SEP]
[CLS] he quickly showed at yale the same traits he had at j ##hu and brown : he produced brilliant theoretical research , but was incapable of giving a lecture at a level that a student ( even a graduate student ) could comprehend . [SEP]
[CLS] he was also unable to direct the research of graduate students , except for the occasional outstanding one . [SEP]
[CLS] during the late 1930s , on ##sa ##ger researched the dip ##ole theory of die ##le ##ctric ##s , making improvements for another topic that had been studied by peter de ##by ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1940s , on ##sa ##ger studied the statistical - mechanical theory of phase transitions in solids , der ##iving a mathematical ##ly elegant theory which was enthusiastically received . [SEP]
[CLS] in what is widely considered a tour de force of mathematical physics , he obtained the exact solution for the two dimensional is ##ing model in zero field in 1944 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1945 , on ##sa ##ger was naturalized as an american citizen , and the same year he was awarded the title of " j . willard gibbs professor of theoretical chemistry " . [SEP]
[CLS] this was particularly appropriate because on ##sa ##ger , like willard gibbs , had been involved primarily in the application of mathematics to problems in physics and chemistry and , in a sense , could be considered to be continuing in the same areas gibbs had pioneered . [SEP]
[CLS] he also worked on the theories of liquid crystals and the electrical properties of ice . [SEP]
[CLS] while on a fulbright scholarship to the university of cambridge , he worked on the magnetic properties of metals . [SEP]
[CLS] he then became a member of the center for theoretical studies , university of miami , and was appointed distinguished university professor of physics . [SEP]
[CLS] at the university of miami he remained active in guiding and inspiring postdoctoral students as his teaching skills , although not his le ##cturing skills , had improved during the course of his career . [SEP]
[CLS] while kirk ##wood ' s tombstone has a long list of awards and positions , including the american chemical society award in pure chemistry , the richards medal , and the lewis award , on ##sa ##ger ' s tombstone , in its original form , simply said " nobel laureate " . [SEP]
[CLS] when on ##sa ##ger ' s wife gr ##ete ##l died in 1991 and was buried there , his children added an as ##ter ##isk after " nobel laureate , " and " * etc . " [SEP]
[CLS] in the lower right corner of the stone . [SEP]
[CLS] the norwegian institute of technology established the lars on ##sa ##ger lecture and the lars on ##sa ##ger professorship in 1993 to award outstanding scientists in the scientific fields of lars on ##sa ##ger ; chemistry , physics and mathematics . [SEP]
