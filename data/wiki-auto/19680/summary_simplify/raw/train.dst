Mario Kart is a series of go-kart-style racing video games developed and published by Nintendo as spin-offs from its trademark Super Mario series.
The first in the series, "Super Mario Kart", was launched in 1992 on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to critical and commercial success.
With six "Mario Kart" games released on home consoles, three on portable handheld consoles, four arcade games co-developed with Namco and one for mobile phones on the way, the Mario Kart series includes a total of fourteen entries.
The latest game in the main series, "Mario Kart 8 Deluxe", was released on Nintendo Switch in April 2017.
The first title in the "Mario Kart" series, "Super Mario Kart," was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992.
The development of the first game was overseen by Shigeru Miyamoto, the Japanese video game designer who created the original "Super Mario Bros." as well as many other successful games for Nintendo.
Darran Jones of NowGamer suggests that the original success of "Super Mario Kart" was the result of including characters previously seen in "Mario Bros." games, while also being a new type of racing game.
In the "Mario Kart" series, players compete in go-kart races, controlling one of a selection of characters, typically from the "Mario" franchise.
These power-ups include mushrooms to give players a speed boost, Koopa Shells to be thrown at opponents, banana peelsand fake item boxes that can be laid on the course as hazards.
The type of weapon received from an item box is influenced by the player's current position in the race.
As the series has progressed, each new installment has introduced new gameplay elements, such as new circuits, items, modes, and playable characters.
Most are based on existing areas in the "Mario" franchise (Bowser's Castle being among the most prominent), but there are a number of courses that have not appeared elsewhere, yet still belong in the Mushroom Kingdom, such as Rainbow Road.
Each game in the series (following the original game) includes at least 16 original courses and up to 6 original battle arenas.
Each game's tracks are divided into four "cups", or groups in which the player has to have the highest overall placing to win.
Most courses can be done in three laps, except in the original game where all circuits required 5 laps to complete.
The first game to feature courses from previous games was "Mario Kart: Super Circuit", which contained all of the tracks from the original Super NES game.
In "Mario Kart 8", 16 additional tracks are available across two downloadable packages, eight for each package downloaded, including seven retro courses, four original courses, and five courses based on other Nintendo franchises, including "Excitebike", "F-Zero", "The Legend of Zelda", and "Animal Crossing".
At one point, there was also a "Mario Kart" game planned for the Virtual Boy in 1995.
The game was cancelled due to the Virtual Boy's commercial failure, but was revealed in a 2000 issue of German gaming magazine "The Big N."
Several "Mario Kart"-related items appear in the "Super Smash Bros." series, with "Super Smash Bros.
Brawl" in particular featuring a Mario Circuit stage based on Figure-8 Circuit from "Mario Kart DS", "Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS" featuring a Rainbow Road stage based on its appearance in "Mario Kart 7", "Super Smash Bros. for Wii U" featuring a Mario Circuit stage based on its appearance in "Mario Kart 8", along with the returning Mario Circuit stage from "Brawl" and "Super Smash Bros.
Among them are a slot car racer series based on "Mario Kart DS", which comes with Mario and Donkey Kong figures, while Wario and Luigi are available separately.
A line of radio-controlled karts have also been marketed, with are controlled by Game Boy Advance-shaped controllers, and feature Mario, Donkey Kong, and Yoshi.
There are additional, larger karts that depict the same trio and are radio-controlled by a GameCube-shape controller.
There are also Sound Drops inspired by "Mario Kart Wii" with eight sounds from the game.
These included a "Mario Kart 8" official soundtrack, a "Mario Kart Wii"-themed stopwatch, and gold trophies modeled after those in "Mario Kart 7".
In 2018, the board game Monopoly Gamer features a "Mario Kart" theme with courses from "Mario Kart 8" and "Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" serving as properties, ten playable characters as tokens, (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Toad, Donkey Kong, Shy Guy, Metal Mario, Rosalina, Bowser, and Yoshi) and a special die with power-ups taken from the series.

MariCar's English website warned customers not to throw "banana peels" or "red turtle shells".
In January 2017, the Japan Patent Office dismissed the objection, ruling that MariCar was not widely recognized as an abbreviation of "Mario Kart".
In September 2018, MariCar was ordered to stop using the characters and pay Nintendo Â¥10 million in damages.
