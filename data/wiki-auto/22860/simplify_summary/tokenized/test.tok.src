[CLS] the pale ##oli ##thic or pal ##ae ##oli ##thic , also called the old stone age , is a period in human pre ##his ##tory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers 99 % of human technological pre ##his ##tory . [SEP]
[CLS] it extends from the earliest known use of stone tools by ho ##mini ##ns 3 . 3 million years ago , to the end of the pleistocene 11 , 650 cal bp . [SEP]
[CLS] the pale ##oli ##thic age is followed in europe by the me ##sol ##ith ##ic age , although the date of the transition varies geographically by several thousand years . [SEP]
[CLS] during the pale ##oli ##thic age , ho ##mini ##ns grouped together in small societies such as bands , and sub ##sis ##ted by gathering plants and fishing , hunting or sc ##ave ##nging wild animals . [SEP]
[CLS] the pale ##oli ##thic age is characterized by the use of kn ##app ##ed stone tools , although at the time humans also used wood and bone tools . [SEP]
[CLS] other organic commodities were adapted for use as tools , including leather and vegetable fibers ; however , due to their rapid deco ##mp ##osing nature , these have not been preserved to any great degree . [SEP]
[CLS] about 50 , 000 years ago , there was a marked increase in the diversity of artifacts . [SEP]
[CLS] in africa , bone artifacts and the first art appear in the archaeological record . [SEP]
[CLS] the first evidence of human fishing is also noted , from artifacts in places such as b ##lom ##bos cave in south africa . [SEP]
[CLS] archaeologists classify artifacts of the last 50 , 000 years into many different categories , such as projectile points , engraving tools , knife blades , and drilling and piercing tools . [SEP]
[CLS] human ##kind gradually evolved from early members of the genus " homo — " such as " homo ha ##bilis " , who used simple stone tools — into anatomical ##ly modern humans as well as behaviour ##ally modern humans by the upper pale ##oli ##thic . [SEP]
[CLS] during the end of the pale ##oli ##thic age , specifically the middle or upper pale ##oli ##thic age , humans began to produce the earliest works of art and began to engage in religious and spiritual behavior such as burial and ritual . [SEP]
[CLS] the climate during the pale ##oli ##thic age consisted of a set of glacial and inter ##gl ##ac ##ial periods in which the climate periodically flu ##ctuated between warm and cool temperatures . [SEP]
[CLS] archaeological and genetic data suggest that the source populations of pale ##oli ##thic humans survived in sparsely wooded areas and dispersed through areas of high primary productivity while avoiding dense forest cover . [SEP]
[CLS] by bp , the first humans set foot in australia . [SEP]
[CLS] by bp , humans lived at 61 ##° ##n latitude in europe . [SEP]
[CLS] by bp , japan was reached , and by bp humans were present in siberia , above the arctic circle . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of the upper pale ##oli ##thic age , a group of humans crossed be ##ring ##ia and quickly expanded throughout the americas . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " pal ##ae ##oli ##thic " was coined by archaeologist john lu ##bb ##ock in 1865 . [SEP]
[CLS] it derives from greek : π ##α ##λ ##α ##ι ##ος , " pal ##ai ##os " , " old " ; and λ ##ι ##θ ##ος , " lit ##hos " , " stone " , meaning " old age of the stone " or " old stone age " . [SEP]
