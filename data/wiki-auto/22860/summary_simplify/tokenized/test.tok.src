[CLS] the pale ##oli ##thic age is followed in europe by the me ##sol ##ith ##ic age , although the date of the transition varies geographically by several thousand years . [SEP]
[CLS] the pale ##oli ##thic age is characterized by the use of kn ##app ##ed stone tools , although at the time humans also used wood and bone tools . [SEP]
