Admiral Arthur Phillip (11 October 1738 – 31 August 1814) was a Royal Navy officer and the first Governor of New South Wales who founded the British penal colony that later became the city of Sydney, Australia.
After much experience at sea, Phillip sailed with the First Fleet as Governor-designate of the proposed British penal colony of New South Wales.
Phillip was a far-sighted governor who soon saw that New South Wales would need a civil administration and a system for emancipating the convicts.
But his plan to bring skilled tradesmen on the voyage had been rejected, and he faced immense problems of labour, discipline and supply.
The arrival of the Second and Third Fleets placed new pressures on the scarce local resources, but by the time Phillip sailed home in December 1792, the colony was taking shape, with official land-grants and systematic farming and water-supply.
Phillip retired in 1805, but continued to correspond with his friends in New South Wales and to promote the colony's interests.
He was a languages teacher who may also have served in the Royal Navy as an able seaman and purser's steward.
At the time of Arthur Phillip's birth, his family maintained a modest existence as tenants near Cheapside in the City of London.
On 22 June 1751 he was accepted into the Greenwich Hospital School, a charity school for the sons of indigent seafarers.
Phillip remained at the Greenwich School for two and a half years, considerably longer than the average student stay of twelve months.
At the end of 1753 he was granted a seven-year indenture as an apprentice aboard "Fortune", a 210-ton whaling vessel commanded by merchant mariner Wiliam Readhead.
Phillip spent the summer of 1754 hunting whales near Svalbard in the Barents Sea.
The ship returned to England in April 1755 and sailed immediately for Svalbard for that year's whale hunt.
Phillip was still a member of the crew, but abandoned his apprenticeship when the ship returned to England on 27 July.
On 16 October he enlisted in the Royal Navy and was assigned the rank of ordinary seaman aboard the 68-gun .
As a member of "Buckingham"' s crew, Phillip saw action in the Seven Years' War, including the Battle of Minorca in 1756.
By 1762 he had transferred to , and was promoted to Lieutenant in recognition of active service in the Battle of Havana.
The War ended in 1763 and Phillip returned to England on half pay.
In July 1763 he married Margaret Denison, a widow 16 years his senior, and moved to Glasshayes in Lyndhurst, Hampshire, establishing a farm there.
The marriage was unhappy, and the couple separated in 1769 when Phillip returned to the Navy.
The following year he was posted as second lieutenant aboard , a newly built 74-gun ship of the line.
While with the Portuguese Navy, Phillip commanded a frigate, the "Nossa Senhora do Pilar."
On this ship he took a detachment of troops from Rio de Janeiro to Colonia do Sacramento on the Río de la Plata (opposite Buenos Aires) to relieve the garrison there.
During a storm encountered in the course of the voyage, the convicts assisted in working the ship and, on arrival at Colonia, Phillip recommended that they be rewarded for saving the ship by remission of their sentences.
A garbled version of this eventually found its way into the English press when Phillip was appointed in 1786 to lead the expedition to Sydney.
The action was reported in the English press: Madrid, Aug. 28.
Letters from Lisbon bring the following Account from Rio Janeiro: That the St. Augustine, of 70 Guns, having been separated from the Squadron of M. Casa Tilly, was attacked by two Portugueze Ships, against which they defended themselves for a Day and a Night, but being next Day surrounded by the Portugueze Fleet, was obliged to surrender.
In July 1782, in a change of government, Thomas Townshend became Secretary of State for Home and American Affairs, and assumed responsibility for organising an expedition against Spanish America.
Phillip's plan was for a squadron of three ships of the line and a frigate to mount a raid on Buenos Aires and Monte Video, then to proceed to the coasts of Chile, Peru and Mexico to maraud, and ultimately to cross the Pacific to join the British Navy's East India squadron for an attack on Manila.
Phillip wrote to Townshend from Rio de Janeiro on 25 April 1783, expressing his disappointment that the ending of the American War had robbed him of the opportunity for naval glory in South America.
After his return to England from India in April 1784, Phillip remained in close contact with Townshend, now Lord Sydney, and the Home Office Under Secretary, Evan Nepean.
From October 1784 to September 1786 he was employed by Nepean, who was in charge of the Secret Service relating to the Bourbon Powers, France and Spain, to spy on the French naval arsenals at Toulon and other ports.
There was fear that Britain would soon be at war with these powers as a consequence of the Batavian Revolution in the Netherlands.
Portraits of the time depict Phillip as shorter than average, with an olive complexion, dark eyes and a "smooth pear of a skull".
His features were dominated by a large and fleshy nose, and by a pronounced lower lip.
At this time, Lord Sandwich, together with the President of the Royal Society, Sir Joseph Banks, was advocating establishment of a British colony in New South Wales.
A colony there would be of great assistance to the British Navy in facilitating attacks on the Spanish possessions in Chile and Peru, as Banks's collaborators, James Matra, Captain Sir George Young and Sir John Call pointed out in written proposals on the subject.
The British Government took the decision to settle what is now Australia and found the Botany Bay colony in August 1786.
Lord Sydney, as Secretary of State for the Home Office, was the minister in charge, and in September 1786 he appointed Phillip commodore of the fleet which was to transport the convicts and soldiers who were to be the new settlers to Botany Bay.
Upon arrival there, Phillip was to assume the powers of Captain General and Governor in Chief of the new colony.
A subsidiary colony was to be founded on Norfolk Island, as recommended by Sir John Call, to take advantage for naval purposes of that island's native flax (harakeke) and timber.
In October 1786, Phillip was appointed captain of and named Governor-designate of New South Wales, the proposed British colony on the east coast of Australia, by Lord Sydney, the Home Secretary.
Everything a new colony might need had to be taken, since Phillip had no real idea of what he might find when he got there.
Phillip was accompanied by a contingent of marines and a handful of other officers who were to administer the colony.
Phillip soon decided that this site, chosen on the recommendation of Sir Joseph Banks, who had accompanied James Cook in 1770, was not suitable, since it had poor soil, no secure anchorage and no reliable water source.
After some exploration Phillip decided to go on to Port Jackson, and on 26 January the marines and convicts landed at Sydney Cove, which Phillip named after Lord Sydney.
Shortly after landing and establishing the settlement at Port Jackson, on 15 February 1788, Phillip sent Lieutenant Philip Gidley King with eight free men and a number of convicts to establish the second British colony in the Pacific at Norfolk Island.
This was partly in response to a perceived threat of losing Norfolk Island to the French and partly to establish an alternative food source for the mainland colony.
With limited supplies, the cultivation of food was imperative, but the soils around Sydney were poor, the climate was unfamiliar, and moreover very few of the convicts had any knowledge of agriculture.
The colony was on the verge of outright starvation for an extended period.
Almost at once, therefore, Phillip had to appoint overseers from among the ranks of the convicts to get the others working.
Phillip showed in other ways that he recognised that New South Wales could not be run simply as a prison camp.
Two convicts, Henry and Susannah Kable, sought to sue Duncan Sinclair, the captain of "Alexander", for stealing their possessions during the voyage.
Despite this, the court found for the plaintiffs and ordered the captain to make restitution for the loss of their possessions.
Further, soon after Lord Sydney appointed him governor of New South Wales Arthur Phillip drew up a detailed memorandum of his plans for the proposed new colony.
In one paragraph he wrote: "The laws of this country England will of course, be introduced in New South Wales, and there is one that I would wish to take place from the moment his Majesty's forces take possession of the country: That there can be no slavery in a free land, and consequently no slaves."
On the beach at Manly, a misunderstanding arose and Phillip was speared in the shoulder: but he ordered his men not to retaliate.
Phillip went some way towards winning the trust of the Eora, although they remained wary of the settlers.
Soon, a virulent disease, smallpox that was believed to be on account of the white settlers, and other European-introduced epidemics, ravaged the Eora population.
The Governor's main problem was with his own military officers, who wanted large grants of land, which Phillip had not been authorised to grant.
He recorded: "The living conditions need to improve or my men won't work as hard, so I have come to a conclusion that I must hire surgeons to fix the convicts."
MacIntyre swore on his death bed that he had done them no harm, but marine officer Watkin Tench was suspicious of the claim.
Phillip, growing frustrated with the burdens of upholding a colony and his health suffering, resigned soon after this episode.
Phillip assigned a convict, James Ruse, land at Rose Hill (now Parramatta) to establish proper farming, and when Ruse succeeded he received the first land grant in the colony.
By December 1790 Phillip was ready to return to England, but the colony had largely been forgotten in London and no instructions reached him, so he carried on.
But July, when the vessels of the Third Fleet began to arrive, with 2,000 more convicts, food again ran short, and he had to send the ship "Atlantic" to Calcutta for supplies.
The whaling industry was established, ships were visiting Sydney to trade, and convicts whose sentences had expired were taking up farming.
The colony was still very short of skilled farmers, craftsmen and tradesmen, and the convicts continued to work as little as possible, even though they were working mainly to grow their own food.
In late 1792, Phillip, whose health was suffering, relinquished his governorship and sailed for England on the ship "Atlantic", taking with him many specimens of plants and animals.
The early years of the colony had been years of struggle and hardship, but the worst was over, and there were no further famines in New South Wales.
Phillip's estranged wife, Margaret, had died in 1792 and was buried in St Beuno's Churchyard, Llanycil, Bala, Merionethshire.
His health gradually recovered and in 1796 he went back to sea, holding a series of commands and responsible posts in the wars against the French.
He continued to correspond with friends in New South Wales and to promote the colony's interests with government officials.
In 2007, Geoffrey Robertson QC alleged that Phillip's remains are no longer in St Nicholas Church, Bathampton and have been lost: "Captain Arthur Phillip is not where the ledger stone says he is: it may be that he is buried somewhere outside, it may simply be that he is simply lost.
Another was unveiled at St Mildred's Church, Bread St, London, in 1932; that church was destroyed in the London Blitz in 1940, but the principal elements of the monument were re-erected at the west end of Watling Street, near Saint Paul's Cathedral, in 1968.
There is a statue of him in the Botanic Gardens, Sydney.
There is a portrait of him by Francis Wheatley in the National Portrait Gallery, London.
As part of a series of events on the bicentenary of his death, a memorial was dedicated in Westminster Abbey on 9 July 2014.
In the service the Dean of Westminster, Very Reverend Dr John Hall, described Phillip as: "This modest, yet world-class seaman, linguist, and patriot, whose selfless service laid the secure foundations on which was developed the Commonwealth of Australia, will always be remembered and honoured alongside other pioneers and inventors here in the Nave: David Livingstone, Thomas Cochrane, and Isaac Newton."
A similar memorial was unveiled by the outgoing 37th Governor of New South Wales, Marie Bashir, in St James' Church, Sydney on 31 August 2014.
He is shown as compassionate and just, but receives little support from his fellow officers.
Phillip is a prominent character in a 2005 film "The Incredible Journey of Mary Bryant" where he is portrayed by Sam Neill.
