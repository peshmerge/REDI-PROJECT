[CLS] admiral arthur phillip ( 11 october 1738 â€“ 31 august 1814 ) was a royal navy officer and the first governor of new south wales who founded the british penal colony that later became the city of sydney , australia . [SEP]
[CLS] after much experience at sea , phillip sailed with the first fleet as governor - designate of the proposed british penal colony of new south wales . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip was a far - sighted governor who soon saw that new south wales would need a civil administration and a system for em ##an ##ci ##pati ##ng the convicts . [SEP]
[CLS] but his plan to bring skilled trades ##men on the voyage had been rejected , and he faced immense problems of labour , discipline and supply . [SEP]
[CLS] the arrival of the second and third fleets placed new pressures on the scarce local resources , but by the time phillip sailed home in december 1792 , the colony was taking shape , with official land - grants and systematic farming and water - supply . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip retired in 1805 , but continued to correspond with his friends in new south wales and to promote the colony ' s interests . [SEP]
[CLS] he was a languages teacher who may also have served in the royal navy as an able seaman and purse ##r ' s steward . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time of arthur phillip ' s birth , his family maintained a modest existence as tenants near cheap ##side in the city of london . [SEP]
[CLS] on 22 june 1751 he was accepted into the greenwich hospital school , a charity school for the sons of ind ##igen ##t sea ##fare ##rs . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip remained at the greenwich school for two and a half years , considerably longer than the average student stay of twelve months . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of 1753 he was granted a seven - year ind ##ent ##ure as an apprentice aboard " fortune " , a 210 - ton whaling vessel commanded by merchant marine ##r wil ##iam read ##head . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip spent the summer of 1754 hunting whales near sv ##al ##bard in the bare ##nts sea . [SEP]
[CLS] the ship returned to england in april 1755 and sailed immediately for sv ##al ##bard for that year ' s whale hunt . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip was still a member of the crew , but abandoned his apprenticeship when the ship returned to england on 27 july . [SEP]
[CLS] on 16 october he enlisted in the royal navy and was assigned the rank of ordinary seaman aboard the 68 - gun . [SEP]
[CLS] as a member of " buckingham " ' s crew , phillip saw action in the seven years ' war , including the battle of minor ##ca in 1756 . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1762 he had transferred to , and was promoted to lieutenant in recognition of active service in the battle of havana . [SEP]
[CLS] the war ended in 1763 and phillip returned to england on half pay . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 1763 he married margaret denis ##on , a widow 16 years his senior , and moved to glass ##hay ##es in l ##yn ##dh ##urst , hampshire , establishing a farm there . [SEP]
[CLS] the marriage was unhappy , and the couple separated in 1769 when phillip returned to the navy . [SEP]
[CLS] the following year he was posted as second lieutenant aboard , a newly built 74 - gun ship of the line . [SEP]
[CLS] while with the portuguese navy , phillip commanded a frigate , the " nos ##sa sen ##hora do pi ##lar . " [SEP]
[CLS] on this ship he took a detachment of troops from rio de janeiro to colon ##ia do sacramento on the rio de la plata ( opposite buenos aires ) to relieve the garrison there . [SEP]
[CLS] during a storm encountered in the course of the voyage , the convicts assisted in working the ship and , on arrival at colon ##ia , phillip recommended that they be rewarded for saving the ship by re ##mission of their sentences . [SEP]
[CLS] a ga ##rb ##led version of this eventually found its way into the english press when phillip was appointed in 1786 to lead the expedition to sydney . [SEP]
[CLS] the action was reported in the english press : madrid , aug . 28 . [SEP]
[CLS] letters from lisbon bring the following account from rio janeiro : that the st . augustine , of 70 guns , having been separated from the squadron of m . casa till ##y , was attacked by two port ##ug ##uez ##e ships , against which they defended themselves for a day and a night , but being next day surrounded by the port ##ug ##uez ##e fleet , was obliged to surrender . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 1782 , in a change of government , thomas towns ##hend became secretary of state for home and american affairs , and assumed responsibility for organising an expedition against spanish america . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip ' s plan was for a squadron of three ships of the line and a frigate to mount a raid on buenos aires and monte video , then to proceed to the coasts of chile , peru and mexico to mara ##ud , and ultimately to cross the pacific to join the british navy ' s east india squadron for an attack on manila . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip wrote to towns ##hend from rio de janeiro on 25 april 1783 , expressing his disappointment that the ending of the american war had robbed him of the opportunity for naval glory in south america . [SEP]
[CLS] after his return to england from india in april 1784 , phillip remained in close contact with towns ##hend , now lord sydney , and the home office under secretary , evan ne ##pe ##an . [SEP]
[CLS] from october 1784 to september 1786 he was employed by ne ##pe ##an , who was in charge of the secret service relating to the bourbon powers , france and spain , to spy on the french naval arsenal ##s at toulon and other ports . [SEP]
[CLS] there was fear that britain would soon be at war with these powers as a consequence of the batavia ##n revolution in the netherlands . [SEP]
[CLS] portraits of the time depict phillip as shorter than average , with an olive complexion , dark eyes and a " smooth pear of a skull " . [SEP]
[CLS] his features were dominated by a large and flesh ##y nose , and by a pronounced lower lip . [SEP]
[CLS] at this time , lord sandwich , together with the president of the royal society , sir joseph banks , was advocating establishment of a british colony in new south wales . [SEP]
[CLS] a colony there would be of great assistance to the british navy in facilitating attacks on the spanish possessions in chile and peru , as banks ' s collaborators , james mat ##ra , captain sir george young and sir john call pointed out in written proposals on the subject . [SEP]
[CLS] the british government took the decision to settle what is now australia and found the botany bay colony in august 1786 . [SEP]
[CLS] lord sydney , as secretary of state for the home office , was the minister in charge , and in september 1786 he appointed phillip commodore of the fleet which was to transport the convicts and soldiers who were to be the new settlers to botany bay . [SEP]
[CLS] upon arrival there , phillip was to assume the powers of captain general and governor in chief of the new colony . [SEP]
[CLS] a subsidiary colony was to be founded on norfolk island , as recommended by sir john call , to take advantage for naval purposes of that island ' s native fl ##ax ( hara ##ke ##ke ) and timber . [SEP]
[CLS] in october 1786 , phillip was appointed captain of and named governor - designate of new south wales , the proposed british colony on the east coast of australia , by lord sydney , the home secretary . [SEP]
[CLS] everything a new colony might need had to be taken , since phillip had no real idea of what he might find when he got there . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip was accompanied by a contingent of marines and a handful of other officers who were to administer the colony . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip soon decided that this site , chosen on the recommendation of sir joseph banks , who had accompanied james cook in 1770 , was not suitable , since it had poor soil , no secure anchorage and no reliable water source . [SEP]
[CLS] after some exploration phillip decided to go on to port jackson , and on 26 january the marines and convicts landed at sydney cove , which phillip named after lord sydney . [SEP]
[CLS] shortly after landing and establishing the settlement at port jackson , on 15 february 1788 , phillip sent lieutenant philip gi ##dley king with eight free men and a number of convicts to establish the second british colony in the pacific at norfolk island . [SEP]
[CLS] this was partly in response to a perceived threat of losing norfolk island to the french and partly to establish an alternative food source for the mainland colony . [SEP]
[CLS] with limited supplies , the cultivation of food was imperative , but the soils around sydney were poor , the climate was unfamiliar , and moreover very few of the convicts had any knowledge of agriculture . [SEP]
[CLS] the colony was on the verge of outright starvation for an extended period . [SEP]
[CLS] almost at once , therefore , phillip had to appoint oversee ##rs from among the ranks of the convicts to get the others working . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip showed in other ways that he recognised that new south wales could not be run simply as a prison camp . [SEP]
[CLS] two convicts , henry and susannah ka ##ble , sought to sue duncan sinclair , the captain of " alexander " , for stealing their possessions during the voyage . [SEP]
[CLS] despite this , the court found for the plaintiffs and ordered the captain to make rest ##it ##ution for the loss of their possessions . [SEP]
[CLS] further , soon after lord sydney appointed him governor of new south wales arthur phillip drew up a detailed memorandum of his plans for the proposed new colony . [SEP]
[CLS] in one paragraph he wrote : " the laws of this country england will of course , be introduced in new south wales , and there is one that i would wish to take place from the moment his majesty ' s forces take possession of the country : that there can be no slavery in a free land , and consequently no slaves . " [SEP]
[CLS] on the beach at manly , a misunderstanding arose and phillip was spear ##ed in the shoulder : but he ordered his men not to re ##tal ##iate . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip went some way towards winning the trust of the e ##ora , although they remained wary of the settlers . [SEP]
[CLS] soon , a vi ##ru ##lent disease , smallpox that was believed to be on account of the white settlers , and other european - introduced epidemic ##s , ravaged the e ##ora population . [SEP]
[CLS] the governor ' s main problem was with his own military officers , who wanted large grants of land , which phillip had not been authorised to grant . [SEP]
[CLS] he recorded : " the living conditions need to improve or my men won ' t work as hard , so i have come to a conclusion that i must hire surgeons to fix the convicts . " [SEP]
[CLS] mac ##int ##yre swore on his death bed that he had done them no harm , but marine officer wat ##kin ten ##ch was suspicious of the claim . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip , growing frustrated with the burden ##s of uphold ##ing a colony and his health suffering , resigned soon after this episode . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip assigned a convict , james ruse , land at rose hill ( now parramatta ) to establish proper farming , and when ruse succeeded he received the first land grant in the colony . [SEP]
[CLS] by december 1790 phillip was ready to return to england , but the colony had largely been forgotten in london and no instructions reached him , so he carried on . [SEP]
[CLS] but july , when the vessels of the third fleet began to arrive , with 2 , 000 more convicts , food again ran short , and he had to send the ship " atlantic " to calcutta for supplies . [SEP]
[CLS] the whaling industry was established , ships were visiting sydney to trade , and convicts whose sentences had expired were taking up farming . [SEP]
[CLS] the colony was still very short of skilled farmers , craftsmen and trades ##men , and the convicts continued to work as little as possible , even though they were working mainly to grow their own food . [SEP]
[CLS] in late 1792 , phillip , whose health was suffering , relinquished his governors ##hip and sailed for england on the ship " atlantic " , taking with him many specimens of plants and animals . [SEP]
[CLS] the early years of the colony had been years of struggle and hardship , but the worst was over , and there were no further famine ##s in new south wales . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip ' s estranged wife , margaret , had died in 1792 and was buried in st be ##uno ' s churchyard , ll ##any ##ci ##l , bala , mer ##ion ##eth ##shire . [SEP]
[CLS] his health gradually recovered and in 1796 he went back to sea , holding a series of commands and responsible posts in the wars against the french . [SEP]
[CLS] he continued to correspond with friends in new south wales and to promote the colony ' s interests with government officials . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2007 , geoffrey robertson qc alleged that phillip ' s remains are no longer in st nicholas church , bath ##amp ##ton and have been lost : " captain arthur phillip is not where the ledger stone says he is : it may be that he is buried somewhere outside , it may simply be that he is simply lost . [SEP]
[CLS] another was unveiled at st mildred ' s church , bread st , london , in 1932 ; that church was destroyed in the london blitz in 1940 , but the principal elements of the monument were re - erected at the west end of wat ##ling street , near saint paul ' s cathedral , in 1968 . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a statue of him in the botanic gardens , sydney . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a portrait of him by francis wheat ##ley in the national portrait gallery , london . [SEP]
[CLS] as part of a series of events on the bi ##cent ##enary of his death , a memorial was dedicated in westminster abbey on 9 july 2014 . [SEP]
[CLS] in the service the dean of westminster , very reverend dr john hall , described phillip as : " this modest , yet world - class seaman , linguist , and patriot , whose self ##less service laid the secure foundations on which was developed the commonwealth of australia , will always be remembered and honoured alongside other pioneers and inventor ##s here in the nave : david livingstone , thomas cochrane , and isaac newton . " [SEP]
[CLS] a similar memorial was unveiled by the outgoing 37th governor of new south wales , marie bash ##ir , in st james ' church , sydney on 31 august 2014 . [SEP]
[CLS] he is shown as compassionate and just , but receives little support from his fellow officers . [SEP]
[CLS] phillip is a prominent character in a 2005 film " the incredible journey of mary bryant " where he is portrayed by sam neill . [SEP]
