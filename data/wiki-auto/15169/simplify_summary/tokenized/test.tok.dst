[CLS] impression ##ism is a 19th - century art movement characterized by relatively small , thin , yet visible brush strokes , open composition , emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities ( often accent ##uating the effects of the passage of time ) , ordinary subject matter , inclusion of " movement " as a crucial element of human perception and experience , and unusual visual angles . [SEP]
[CLS] impression ##ism originated with a group of paris - based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s . [SEP]
[CLS] the impression ##ists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in france . [SEP]
[CLS] the name of the style derives from the title of a claude mon ##et work , " impression , sole ##il levant " ( " impression , sunrise " ) , which provoked the critic louis leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the parisian newspaper " le char ##ivar ##i " . [SEP]
[CLS] the development of impression ##ism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as impression ##ist music and impression ##ist literature . [SEP]
[CLS] radicals in their time , early impression ##ists violated the rules of academic painting . [SEP]
[CLS] they constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and con ##tour ##s , following the example of painters such as eugene del ##ac ##roi ##x and j . m . w . turner . [SEP]
[CLS] they also painted realistic scenes of modern life , and often painted outdoors . [SEP]
[CLS] previously , still life ##s and portraits as well as landscapes were usually painted in a studio . [SEP]
[CLS] the impression ##ists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting outdoors or " en pl ##ein air " . [SEP]
[CLS] they portrayed overall visual effects instead of details , and used short " broken " brush strokes of mixed and pure un ##mi ##xed colour — not blended smoothly or shaded , as was customary — to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration . [SEP]
[CLS] impression ##ism emerged in france at the same time that a number of other painters , including the italian artists known as the mac ##chia ##iol ##i , and winslow homer in the united states , were also exploring " pl ##ein - air " painting . [SEP]
[CLS] the impression ##ists , however , developed new techniques specific to the style . [SEP]
[CLS] encompassing what its adherents argued was a different way of seeing , it is an art of im ##media ##cy and movement , of candi ##d poses and compositions , of the play of light expressed in a bright and varied use of colour . [SEP]
[CLS] the public , at first hostile , gradually came to believe that the impression ##ists had captured a fresh and original vision , even if the art critics and art establishment di ##sa ##pp ##roved of the new style . [SEP]
[CLS] by rec ##rea ##ting the sensation in the eye that views the subject , rather than del ##ine ##ating the details of the subject , and by creating a we ##lter of techniques and forms , impression ##ism is a precursor of various painting styles , including neo - impression ##ism , post - impression ##ism , fa ##u ##vis ##m , and cub ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] in the middle of the 19th century — a time of change , as emperor napoleon iii rebuilt paris and wage ##d war — the academie des beaux - arts dominated french art . [SEP]
[CLS] the academie was the preserve ##r of traditional french painting standards of content and style . [SEP]
[CLS] historical subjects , religious themes , and portraits were valued ; landscape and still life were not . [SEP]
[CLS] the academie preferred carefully finished images that looked realistic when examined closely . [SEP]
[CLS] paintings in this style were made up of precise brush strokes carefully blended to hide the artist ' s hand in the work . [SEP]
[CLS] colour was restrained and often toned down further by the application of a golden var ##nish . [SEP]
[CLS] the academie had an annual , ju ##ried art show , the salon de paris , and artists whose work was displayed in the show won prizes , garnered commissions , and enhanced their prestige . [SEP]
[CLS] the standards of the ju ##ries represented the values of the academie , represented by the works of such artists as jean - leon ge ##rom ##e and alexandre cab ##ane ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 1860s , four young painters — claude mon ##et , pierre - auguste reno ##ir , alfred sis ##ley , and frederic ba ##zi ##lle — met while studying under the academic artist charles g ##ley ##re . [SEP]
[CLS] they discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life rather than historical or mythological scenes . [SEP]
[CLS] following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid - century , they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air , but not for the purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio , as was the usual custom . [SEP]
[CLS] by painting in sunlight directly from nature , and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigment ##s that had become available since the beginning of the century , they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended further the realism of gustave co ##ur ##bet and the bar ##bi ##zon school . [SEP]
[CLS] a favourite meeting place for the artists was the cafe gu ##er ##bo ##is on avenue de cl ##ich ##y in paris , where the discussions were often led by edouard mane ##t , whom the younger artists greatly admired . [SEP]
[CLS] they were soon joined by camille piss ##ar ##ro , paul ce ##zan ##ne , and armand gui ##lla ##umi ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1860s , the salon jury routinely rejected about half of the works submitted by mon ##et and his friends in favour of works by artists faithful to the approved style . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1863 , the salon jury rejected mane ##t ' s " the lunch ##eon on the grass " " ( le de ##je ##une ##r sur l ' herb ##e ) " primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men at a picnic . [SEP]
[CLS] while the salon jury routinely accepted nude ##s in historical and all ##egorical paintings , they condemned mane ##t for placing a realistic nude in a contemporary setting . [SEP]
[CLS] the jury ' s severely word ##ed rejection of mane ##t ' s painting appalled his admire ##rs , and the unusually large number of rejected works that year per ##tur ##bed many french artists . [SEP]
[CLS] after emperor napoleon iii saw the rejected works of 1863 , he decreed that the public be allowed to judge the work themselves , and the salon des refuses ( salon of the refused ) was organized . [SEP]
[CLS] while many viewers came only to laugh , the salon des refuses drew attention to the existence of a new tendency in art and attracted more visitors than the regular salon . [SEP]
[CLS] artists ' petitions requesting a new salon des refuses in 1867 , and again in 1872 , were denied . [SEP]
[CLS] in december 1873 , mon ##et , reno ##ir , piss ##ar ##ro , sis ##ley , ce ##zan ##ne , berth ##e mori ##so ##t , edgar de ##gas and several other artists founded the " societe an ##ony ##me cooperative des artist ##es pei ##nt ##res , sc ##ul ##pt ##eurs , grave ##urs " ( " cooperative and anonymous association of painters , sculptors , and engraver ##s " ) to exhibit their artworks independently . [SEP]
[CLS] members of the association were expected to for ##sw ##ear participation in the salon . [SEP]
[CLS] the organizers invited a number of other progressive artists to join them in their inaugural exhibition , including the older eugene bo ##udi ##n , whose example had first persuaded mon ##et to adopt " pl ##ein air " painting years before . [SEP]
[CLS] another painter who greatly influenced mon ##et and his friends , johan jong ##kind , declined to participate , as did edouard mane ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] in total , thirty artists participated in their first exhibition , held in april 1874 at the studio of the photographer nad ##ar . [SEP]
[CLS] the critical response was mixed . [SEP]
[CLS] mon ##et and ce ##zan ##ne received the harsh ##est attacks . [SEP]
[CLS] critic and humor ##ist louis leroy wrote a sc ##athing review in the newspaper " le char ##ivar ##i " in which , making word ##play with the title of claude mon ##et ' s " impression , sunrise " " ( impression , sole ##il levant ) " , he gave the artists the name by which they became known . [SEP]
[CLS] der ##isi ##vel ##y ti ##tling his article " " , leroy declared that mon ##et ' s painting was at most , a sketch , and could hardly be termed a finished work . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote , in the form of a dial ##og between viewers , [SEP]
[CLS] the term " impression ##ist " quickly gained favour with the public . [SEP]
[CLS] it was also accepted by the artists themselves , even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament , unified primarily by their spirit of independence and rebellion . [SEP]
[CLS] they exhibited together — albeit with shifting membership — eight times between 1874 and 1886 . [SEP]
[CLS] the impression ##ists ' style , with its loose , spontaneous brush ##st ##rok ##es , would soon become synonymous with modern life . [SEP]
[CLS] mon ##et , sis ##ley , mori ##so ##t , and piss ##ar ##ro may be considered the " pure ##st " impression ##ists , in their consistent pursuit of an art of sp ##ont ##ane ##ity , sunlight , and colour . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##gas rejected much of this , as he believed in the prima ##cy of drawing over colour and bel ##itt ##led the practice of painting outdoors . [SEP]
[CLS] reno ##ir turned away from impression ##ism for a time during the 1880s , and never entirely regained his commitment to its ideas . [SEP]
[CLS] edouard mane ##t , although regarded by the impression ##ists as their leader , never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour ( while impression ##ists avoided its use and preferred to obtain darker colours by mixing ) , and never participated in the impression ##ist exhibitions . [SEP]
[CLS] he continued to submit his works to the salon , where his painting " spanish singer " had won a 2nd class medal in 1861 , and he urged the others to do likewise , arguing that " the salon is the real field of battle " where a reputation could be made . [SEP]
[CLS] among the artists of the core group ( minus ba ##zi ##lle , who had died in the franco - prussian war in 1870 ) , defect ##ions occurred as ce ##zan ##ne , followed later by reno ##ir , sis ##ley , and mon ##et , abs ##tained from the group exhibitions so they could submit their works to the salon . [SEP]
[CLS] disagreements arose from issues such as gui ##lla ##umi ##n ' s membership in the group , championed by piss ##ar ##ro and ce ##zan ##ne against opposition from mon ##et and de ##gas , who thought him un ##worthy . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##gas invited mary cass ##att to display her work in the 1879 exhibition , but also insisted on the inclusion of jean - francois raf ##fa ##elli , lu ##do ##vic le ##pic , and other real ##ists who did not represent impression ##ist practices , causing mon ##et in 1880 to accuse the impression ##ists of " opening doors to first - come da ##uber ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] the group divided over invitations to paul sign ##ac and georges se ##ura ##t to exhibit with them in 1886 . [SEP]
[CLS] piss ##ar ##ro was the only artist to show at all eight impression ##ist exhibitions . [SEP]
[CLS] the individual artists achieved few financial rewards from the impression ##ist exhibitions , but their art gradually won a degree of public acceptance and support . [SEP]
[CLS] their dealer , duran ##d - rue ##l , played a major role in this as he kept their work before the public and arranged shows for them in london and new york . [SEP]
[CLS] although sis ##ley died in poverty in 1899 , reno ##ir had a great salon success in 1879 . [SEP]
[CLS] mon ##et became secure financially during the early 1880s and so did piss ##ar ##ro by the early 1890s . [SEP]
[CLS] by this time the methods of impression ##ist painting , in a dil ##uted form , had become commonplace in salon art . [SEP]
[CLS] french painters who prepared the way for impression ##ism include the romantic colour ##ist eugene del ##ac ##roi ##x , the leader of the real ##ists gustave co ##ur ##bet , and painters of the bar ##bi ##zon school such as theodore rousseau . [SEP]
[CLS] the impression ##ists learned much from the work of johan bart ##hold jong ##kind , jean - baptiste - camille co ##rot and eugene bo ##udi ##n , who painted from nature in a direct and spontaneous style that pre ##fi ##gur ##ed impression ##ism , and who befriended and advised the younger artists . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed to the innovative style of the impression ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] although these methods had been used by previous artists — and are often conspicuous in the work of artists such as fran ##s hal ##s , diego ve ##la ##zquez , peter paul ruben ##s , john constable , and j . m . w . turner — the impression ##ists were the first to use them all together , and with such consistency . [SEP]
[CLS] new technology played a role in the development of the style . [SEP]
[CLS] impression ##ists took advantage of the mid - century introduction of prem ##ix ##ed paints in tin tubes ( resembling modern tooth ##pas ##te tubes ) , which allowed artists to work more spontaneously , both outdoors and indoors . [SEP]
[CLS] previously , painters made their own paints individually , by grinding and mixing dry pigment powder ##s with lin ##see ##d oil , which were then stored in animal bladder ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] many vivid synthetic pigment ##s became commercially available to artists for the first time during the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] these included cobalt blue , vi ##rid ##ian , cad ##mium yellow , and synthetic ultra ##marine blue , all of which were in use by the 1840s , before impression ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] the impression ##ists ' manner of painting made bold use of these pigment ##s , and of even newer colours such as ce ##ru ##lean blue , which became commercially available to artists in the 1860s . [SEP]
[CLS] the impression ##ists ' progress toward a brighter style of painting was gradual . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1860s , mon ##et and reno ##ir sometimes painted on canvas ##es prepared with the traditional red - brown or grey ground . [SEP]
[CLS] by the 1870s , mon ##et , reno ##ir , and piss ##ar ##ro usually chose to paint on grounds of a lighter grey or beige colour , which functioned as a middle tone in the finished painting . [SEP]
[CLS] by the 1880s , some of the impression ##ists had come to prefer white or slightly off - white grounds , and no longer allowed the ground colour a significant role in the finished painting . [SEP]
[CLS] prior to the impression ##ists , other painters , notably such 17th - century dutch painters as jan ste ##en , had emphasized common subjects , but their methods of composition were traditional . [SEP]
[CLS] they arranged their compositions so that the main subject commanded the viewer ' s attention . [SEP]
[CLS] j . m . w . turner , while an artist of the romantic era , anticipated the style of impression ##ism with his artwork . [SEP]
[CLS] the impression ##ists relaxed the boundary between subject and background so that the effect of an impression ##ist painting often resembles a snaps ##hot , a part of a larger reality captured as if by chance . [SEP]
[CLS] photography was gaining popularity , and as cameras became more portable , photographs became more candi ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] photography inspired impression ##ists to represent momentary action , not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape , but in the day - to - day lives of people . [SEP]
[CLS] the development of impression ##ism can be considered partly as a reaction by artists to the challenge presented by photography , which seemed to dev ##al ##ue the artist ' s skill in rep ##rod ##uc ##ing reality . [SEP]
[CLS] both portrait and landscape paintings were deemed somewhat def ##icient and lacking in truth as photography " produced life ##like images much more efficiently and re ##lia ##bly " . [SEP]
[CLS] in spite of this , photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression , and rather than compete with photography to em ##ulate reality , artists focused " on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph — by further developing into an art form its very subject ##ivity in the conception of the image , the very subject ##ivity that photography eliminated " . [SEP]
[CLS] the impression ##ists sought to express their perceptions of nature , rather than create exact representations . [SEP]
[CLS] this allowed artists to depict subjective ##ly what they saw with their " ta ##cit imperative ##s of taste and conscience " . [SEP]
[CLS] photography encouraged painters to exploit aspects of the painting medium , like colour , which photography then lacked : " the impression ##ists were the first to consciously offer a subjective alternative to the photograph " . [SEP]
[CLS] another major influence was japanese uk ##iy ##o - e art prints ( ja ##pon ##ism ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the art of these prints contributed significantly to the " snaps ##hot " angles and unconventional compositions that became characteristic of impression ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] an example is mon ##et ' s " jar ##din a sainte - ad ##ress ##e " , 1867 , with its bold blocks of colour and composition on a strong diagonal slant showing the influence of japanese prints [SEP]
[CLS] edgar de ##gas was both an avid photographer and a collector of japanese prints . [SEP]
[CLS] his " the dance class " " ( la class ##e de dans ##e ) " of 1874 shows both influences in its as ##ym ##metric ##al composition . [SEP]
[CLS] the dancers are seemingly caught off guard in various awkward poses , leaving an expanse of empty floor space in the lower right quadrant . [SEP]
[CLS] he also captured his dancers in sculpture , such as the " little dancer of fourteen years " . [SEP]
[CLS] impression ##ists , in varying degrees , were looking for ways to depict visual experience and contemporary subjects . [SEP]
[CLS] women impression ##ists were interested in these same ideals but had many social and career limitations compared to male impression ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] in particular , they were excluded from the imagery of the bourgeois social sphere of the boulevard , cafe , and dance hall . [SEP]
[CLS] as well as imagery , women were excluded from the format ##ive discussions that resulted in meetings in those places ; that was where male impression ##ists were able to form and share ideas about impression ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] in the academic realm , women were believed to be incapable of handling complex subjects which led teachers to restrict what they taught female students . [SEP]
[CLS] it was also considered un ##lad ##yl ##ike to excel in art since women ' s true talents were then believed to center on home ##making and mother ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] yet several women were able to find success during their lifetime , even though their careers were affected by personal circumstances – bra ##c ##que ##mond , for example , had a husband who was res ##ent ##ful of her work which caused her to give up painting . [SEP]
[CLS] the four most well known , namely , mary cass ##att , eva gonzales , marie bra ##c ##que ##mond , and berth ##e mori ##so ##t , are , and were , often referred to as the ' women impression ##ists ' . [SEP]
[CLS] their participation in the series of eight impression ##ist exhibitions that took place in paris from 1874 to 1886 varied : mori ##so ##t participated in seven , cass ##att in four , bra ##c ##que ##mond in three , and gonzales did not participate . [SEP]
[CLS] the critics of the time lump ##ed these four together without regard to their personal styles , techniques , or subject matter . [SEP]
[CLS] critics viewing their works at the exhibitions often attempted to acknowledge the women artists ' talents but ci ##rc ##ums ##cr ##ibe ##d them within a limited notion of fe ##mini ##nity . [SEP]
[CLS] arguing for the suit ##ability of impression ##ist technique to women ' s manner of perception , parisian critic s . c . de so ##isson ##s wrote : one can understand that women have no original ##ity of thought , and that literature and music have no feminine character ; but surely women know how to observe , and what they see is quite different from that which men see , and the art which they put in their gestures , in their toilet , in the decoration of their environment is sufficient to give is the idea of an instinct ##ive , of a peculiar genius which resides in each one of them . [SEP]
[CLS] while impression ##ism leg ##iti ##mi ##zed the domestic social life as subject matter , of which women had intimate knowledge , it also tended to limit them to that subject matter . [SEP]
[CLS] portrayal ##s of often - identifiable sit ##ters in domestic settings ( which could offer commissions ) were dominant in the exhibitions . [SEP]
[CLS] the subjects of the paintings were often women interacting with their environment by either their gaze or movement . [SEP]
[CLS] cass ##att , in particular , was aware of her placement of subjects : she kept her predominantly female figures from object ##ification and cl ##iche ; when they are not reading , they converse , se ##w , drink tea , and when they are inactive , they seem lost in thought . [SEP]
[CLS] the women impression ##ists , like their male counterparts , were st ##ri ##ving for " truth , " for new ways of seeing and new painting techniques ; each artist had an individual painting style . [SEP]
[CLS] women impression ##ists ( particularly mori ##so ##t and cass ##att ) were conscious of the balance of power between women and objects in their paintings – the bourgeois women depicted are not defined by decorative objects , but instead , interact with and dominate the things with which they live . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many similarities in their depictions of women who seem both at ease and subtly confined . [SEP]
[CLS] gonzales ' " box at the italian opera " depicts a woman staring into the distance , at ease in a social sphere but confined by the box and the man standing next to her . [SEP]
[CLS] cass ##att ' s painting " young girl at a window " is brighter in color but remains constrained by the canvas edge as she looks out the window . [SEP]
[CLS] despite their success in their ability to have a career and impression ##ism ' s demise attributed to its allegedly feminine characteristics ( its sensual ##ity , dependence on sensation , physical ##ity , and fluid ##ity ) the four women artists ( and other , lesser - known women impression ##ists ) were largely omitted from art historical textbooks covering impression ##ist artists until tam ##ar ga ##rb ' s " women impression ##ists " published in 1986 . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , " impression ##ism " by jean ley ##mar ##ie , published in 1955 included no information on any women impression ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] among the close associates of the impression ##ists were several painters who adopted their methods to some degree . [SEP]
[CLS] these include jean - louis for ##ain ( who participated in impression ##ist exhibitions in 1879 , 1880 , 1881 and 1886 ) and giuseppe de ni ##tti ##s , an italian artist living in paris who participated in the first impression ##ist exhibit at the invitation of de ##gas , although the other impression ##ists di ##spar ##aged his work . [SEP]
[CLS] federico za ##ndo ##men ##eg ##hi was another italian friend of de ##gas who showed with the impression ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] eva gonzales was a follower of mane ##t who did not exhibit with the group . [SEP]
[CLS] james abbott mc ##neil ##l whistle ##r was an american - born painter who played a part in impression ##ism although he did not join the group and preferred gray ##ed colours . [SEP]
[CLS] walter sick ##ert , an english artist , was initially a follower of whistle ##r , and later an important disciple of de ##gas ; he did not exhibit with the impression ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1904 the artist and writer w ##yn ##ford dew ##hurst wrote the first important study of the french painters published in english , " impression ##ist painting : its genesis and development " , which did much to popular ##ize impression ##ism in great britain . [SEP]
[CLS] by the early 1880s , impression ##ist methods were affecting , at least superficial ##ly , the art of the salon . [SEP]
[CLS] fashionable painters such as jean be ##ra ##ud and henri ge ##r ##ve ##x found critical and financial success by bright ##ening their palette ##s while retaining the smooth finish expected of salon art . [SEP]
[CLS] works by these artists are sometimes casually referred to as impression ##ism , despite their remote ##ness from impression ##ist practice . [SEP]
[CLS] the influence of the french impression ##ists lasted long after most of them had died . [SEP]
[CLS] artists like j . d . ki ##rs ##zen ##baum were borrowing impression ##ist techniques throughout the twentieth century . [SEP]
[CLS] as the influence of impression ##ism spread beyond france , artists , too numerous to list , became identified as practitioners of the new style . [SEP]
[CLS] the sculptor auguste rod ##in is sometimes called an impression ##ist for the way he used roughly modeled surfaces to suggest transient light effects . [SEP]
[CLS] pictorial ##ist photographers whose work is characterized by soft focus and atmospheric effects have also been called impression ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] french impression ##ist cinema is a term applied to a loosely defined group of films and filmmakers in france from 1919 – 1929 , although these years are de ##bat ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] french impression ##ist filmmakers include abel gan ##ce , jean epstein , germain ##e du ##la ##c , marcel l ’ herb ##ier , louis dell ##uc , and dmitry ki ##rsa ##no ##ff . [SEP]
[CLS] musical impression ##ism is the name given to a movement in european classical music that arose in the late 19th century and continued into the middle of the 20th century . [SEP]
[CLS] originating in france , musical impression ##ism is characterized by suggestion and atmosphere , and es ##che ##ws the emotional excess ##es of the romantic era . [SEP]
[CLS] impression ##ist composers favoured short forms such as the no ##ct ##urne , arab ##es ##que , and prelude , and often explored uncommon scales such as the whole tone scale . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps the most notable innovations of impression ##ist composers were the introduction of major 7th chords and the extension of chord structures in 3rd ##s to five - and six - part harmonies . [SEP]
[CLS] the influence of visual impression ##ism on its musical counterpart is de ##bat ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] claude de ##bus ##sy and maurice rave ##l are generally considered the greatest impression ##ist composers , but de ##bus ##sy di ##sa ##vo ##wed the term , calling it the invention of critics . [SEP]
[CLS] erik sat ##ie was also considered in this category , though his approach was regarded as less serious , more musical novelty in nature . [SEP]
[CLS] paul du ##kas is another french composer sometimes considered an impression ##ist , but his style is perhaps more closely aligned to the late romantic ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] musical impression ##ism beyond france includes the work of such composers as otto ##rino res ##pi ##ghi ( italy ) , ralph vaughan williams , cyril scott , and john ireland ( england ) , manuel de fall ##a and isaac al ##ben ##iz ( spain ) , and charles gr ##iff ##es ( america ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the term impression ##ism has also been used to describe works of literature in which a few select details su ##ffi ##ce to convey the sensory impressions of an incident or scene . [SEP]
[CLS] impression ##ist literature is closely related to symbolism , with its major ex ##em ##pl ##ars being ba ##ude ##lai ##re , mall ##arm ##e , rim ##bau ##d , and ve ##rl ##aine . [SEP]
[CLS] authors such as virginia woolf , d . h . lawrence , and joseph conrad have written works that are impression ##istic in the way that they describe , rather than interpret , the impressions , sensations and emotions that constitute a character ' s mental life . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1880s several artists began to develop different pre ##ce ##pts for the use of colour , pattern , form , and line , derived from the impression ##ist example : vincent van gogh , paul ga ##ug ##uin , georges se ##ura ##t , and henri de toulouse - lau ##tre ##c . [SEP]
[CLS] these artists were slightly younger than the impression ##ists , and their work is known as post - impression ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the original impression ##ist artists also ventured into this new territory ; camille piss ##ar ##ro briefly painted in a point ##ill ##ist manner , and even mon ##et abandoned strict " pl ##ein air " painting . [SEP]
[CLS] paul ce ##zan ##ne , who participated in the first and third impression ##ist exhibitions , developed a highly individual vision emphasis ##ing pictorial structure , and he is more often called a post - impression ##ist . [SEP]
[CLS] although these cases illustrate the difficulty of assign ##ing labels , the work of the original impression ##ist painters may , by definition , be cat ##ego ##rise ##d as impression ##ism . [SEP]
