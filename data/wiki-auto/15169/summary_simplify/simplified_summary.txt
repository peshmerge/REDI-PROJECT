impressionism is a 19th-century art movement .
the name of the style came from the title of a claude monet work , impression , soleil levant .
impressionism was developed in the visual arts soon after that .
radicals in their time were very important in painting .
they constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and contours .
the impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting outdoors or " en plein air " .
they had overall visual effects instead of details , and used short " broken " brush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour – not blended smoothly or shaded , as was customary — to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration .
impressionism emerged in france at the same time that a number of other painters , including the italian artists known as the macchiaioli , and winslow homer in the united states , were also exploring plein-air painting .
it includes candid poses and compositions , of the play of light expressed in a bright and varied use of colour .
the public , at first hostile , gradually came to believe that the impressionists had captured a fresh and original vision , even if the art critics and art establishment disapproved of the new style .

the academie was the preserver of traditional french painting standards of content and style .
paintings in this style were made up of brush strokes carefully blended to hide the artist 's hand in the work .
colour was restrained and often toned down further by the use of a golden varnish .
artists whose work was displayed in the show won prizes , garnered commissions , and enhanced their prestige .
they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air .
by painting in sunlight directly from nature , and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century , they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting .
a favourite meeting place for the artists was the cafe guerbois in paris .
in 1863 , the salon jury rejected manet 's " luncheon on the grass " .
the jury rejected the painting , and the unusually large number of rejected works that year perturbed many french artists .

the term " impressionist " quickly gained favour with the public .
they were also accepted by the artists themselves .
the impressionists ' style , with its loose brushstrokes , would soon become synonymous with modern life .
degas rejected much of this , as he believed in the primacy of drawing over colour and belittled the practice of painting outdoors .
edouard manet , although regarded by the impressionists as their leader , never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colourative while impressionists avoided its use and preferred to obtain darker colours by mixing guangzhou , and never participated in the impressionist exhibitions .

by this time the ways of impressionist painting had become commonplace in salon art .
french painters who prepared the way for impressionism include the romantic colourist eugene delacroix , the leader of the realists gustave courbet , and painters of the barbizon school such as theodore rousseau .
the impressionists learned much from the work of johan barthold jongkind , jean-baptiste-camille corot and eugene boudin , who painted from nature in a direct and spontaneous style that prefigured impressionism , and who befriended and advised the younger artists .
although these methods had been used by previous artists , and are often conspicuous in the work of artists such as frans hals , diego velazquez , peter paul rubens , john constable , and j . m . w . turner — the impressionists were the first to use them all together , and with such consistency .

by the 1880s , some of the impressionists had come to prefer white or slightly off-white grounds , and no longer allowed the ground colour a significant role in the finished painting .
before the impressionists , other painters , notably 17th-century dutch painters as jan steen , had emphasized common subjects , but their methods of composition were traditional .
the impressionists relaxed the boundary between subject and background so that the effect of an impressionist painting often resembles a snapshot , a part of a larger reality captured as if by chance .
photography inspired impressionists to represent momentary action , not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape , but in the day-to-day lives of people .
impressionism was a reaction by artists to the challenge presented by photography .
both portrait and landscape paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography " produced lifelike images much more efficiently and reliably " .
in spite of this , photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression , and rather than compete with photography to reality , artists focused " on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph . "

during the 1880s several artists began to develop different precepts for the use of colour , pattern , form , and line .
paul cezanne , who took part in the first and third impressionist exhibitions , developed a highly individual vision emphasising pictorial structure , and he is more often called a post-impressionist .
although these cases illustrate the difficulty of assigning labels , the work of the original impressionist painters may be categorised as impressionism .
