to prevent american intervention while getting in the perimeter , it was planned to destroy the united states pacific fleet and the american military in the philippines from the outset .
on 7 december 1941 japan attacked british and american holdings with near-simultaneous attacks against southeast asia and the central pacific .
these included an attack on the american fleets at pearl harbor and the philippines , landings in thailand and malaya , and the battle of hong kong .
the attacks led the united states , united kingdom , china , australia and several other states to declare war on japan .
germany , followed by the other axis states , declared war on the united states in solidarity with japan .
on january 1,1942 , the allied big four — the soviet union , china , the united kingdom and the united states — and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the declaration .

in early june , japan put its attacks into action , but the americans were fully aware of the plans and order of battle .
in burma , the commonwealth forces had two operations .
the first , an offensive into the arakan region in late 1942 , went disastrously , forcing a retreat back to india by may 1943 .

germany had been divided , and two independent states , the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic , were created within the borders of allied and soviet occupation zones .
the rest of europe was also divided into western and soviet spheres of influence .
the long period of political tensions and military competition between them would be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and proxy wars .

because of international trade , this led to european economic stagnation and delayed european recovery for several years .
the recovery of the currency in western germany was the start of the world trade ii plan .
the soviet union , despite enormous human and material losses , also experienced rapid increase in production .
japan had incredibly quick economic growth , becoming one of the most powerful economies in the 1980s .
a quarter of the people in the soviet union were wounded or killed .
of the total number of deaths in world war ii , approximately 85 % — mostly soviet and chinese — were on the allied side .

about 10,000 ukrainians were killed by the polish home army and other polish units , in reprisal attacks .
in asia and the pacific , between 3 million and more than 10 million civilians , mostly chinesegraphs were killed by the japanese .
the most infamous japanese atrocity was the nanking massacre , in which fifty to three hundred thousand chinese civilians were murdered .
the imperial japanese army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of china foley " see unit 731 "arth and in early conflicts against the soviets .
both the germans and japanese tested such weapons against civilians , and sometimes on prisoners of war .
the soviet union was responsible for the katyn massacre of 22,000 polish officers , and the imprisonment or execution of thousands of political prisoners by the nkvd , along with mass civilian deportations to siberia , in the baltic states and eastern poland annexed by the red army .
the mass-bombing of cities in europe and asia has often been called a war crime .
soviet pows were kept in especially unbearable conditions , and 3.6 million soviet pows out of 5.7 died in nazi camps during the war .
death camps were also created in nazi germany to kill people at an industrial scale .
during wartime privation and hunger caused many deaths of inmates , including foreign citizens of poland and other countries occupied by the soviet union , as well as axis pows .
by the end of the war , most soviet pows liberated from nazi camps and many civilians were taken away from the nazis .
the death rate of western prisoners was 27.1 per cent nedra for american pows , 37 % bronze medals , seven times that of prisoners under germans and italians .
in western , northern , and central europe , denmark , the low countries , and the annexed portions of czechoslovakia czechoslovakianhead germany made economic policies .
the income from occupied nations was over 40 % of the total german income .
in the east , the gains of " lebensraum " were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the german invaders .
unlike in the west , the nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the " inferior people " of slavic descent .
although the resistance groups formed in most occupied territories , they did not have much german operations in either the east or the west until late 1943 .
in asia , japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the greater east asia co-prosperity sphere .
although japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from european domination in some territories , their cruel actions turned local public opinion against them within weeks .
before the war , the allies had a lot of advantages in both population and economics .
if colonies are included , it then gives the allies more than a 5 : 1 advantage in population and nearly 2 .
in asia at the same time , china had roughly six times the population of japan , but only an 89 % higher gdp .
the united states provided about two-thirds of all the ordnance used by the allies in terms of warships , transports , warplanes , artillery , tanks , trucks , and ammunition .
the allies ' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid rapid blitzkrieg attacks of germany and japan .
to improve their production , germany and japan used millions of slave labourers ; germany used about 12 million people , mostly from eastern europe , while japan used more than 18 million people in far east asia .
the allies also made strategic bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy 's ability to wage war ashore .
carriers were also more economical than battleships because of the relatively low cost of aircraft and their not needing to be as heavily armoured .
submarines , which had proved to be effective weapons during the first world war , were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second .
the british focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics , such as sonar and convoys , while germany focused on improving its attack capability , with designs such as the type vii submarine and wolfpack tactics .
the germans had improved artillery to use the speed of both infantry and cavalry .
at the start of the war , most commanders thought that enemy tanks should be met by tanks with better specifications .
this idea was challenged by the poor performance of the tank guns against armour .
many means of destroying tanks , including indirect artillery , anti-tank guns blew up both towed and self-propelled charlemagne , mines , short-ranged infantry antitank weapons , and other tanks were used .
even with large-scale mechanisation , infantry remained the backbone of all forces , and throughout the war , most infantry were equipped similarly to world war i .
the portable machine gun spread , a notable example being the german mg34 , and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings .
notable examples were the allied decryption of japanese naval codes and british ultra , a pioneering method for decoding enigma benefiting from information given to the united kingdom by the polish cipher bureau , which had been decoding early versions of enigma before the war .
another part of military intelligence was the use of deception , which the allies used to great effect , such as in operations mincemeat and bodyguard .
other technological and engineering feats achieved during the war include the world 's first programmable computersttered z3 , colossus , and eniaceux , guided missiles and modern rockets , the manhattan project 's development of nuclear weapons , operations research and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the english channel .
