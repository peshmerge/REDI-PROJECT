[CLS] on 22 june 1941 , the european axis powers launched an invasion of the soviet union , opening the largest land theatre of war in history . [SEP]
[CLS] in december 1941 , japan launched a surprise attack on the united states as well as european colonies in the pacific . [SEP]
[CLS] following an immediate u . s . declaration of war against japan , supported by one from great britain , the european axis powers quickly declared war on the u . s . in solidarity with their japanese ally . [SEP]
[CLS] rapid japanese conquest ##s over much of the western pacific ensued , perceived by many in asia as liberation from western dominance and resulting in the support of several armies from defeated territories . [SEP]
[CLS] the axis advance in the pacific halted in 1942 when japan lost the critical battle of midway ; later , germany and italy were defeated in north africa and then , decisive ##ly , at stalin ##grad in the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] key set ##backs in 1943 , which included a series of german defeats on the eastern front , the allied invasions of sicily and italy , and allied victories in the pacific , cost the axis its initiative and forced it into strategic retreat on all fronts . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1944 , the western allies invaded german - occupied france , while the soviet union regained its territorial losses and turned toward germany and its allies . [SEP]
[CLS] during 1944 and 1945 the japanese suffered major reverse ##s in mainland asia , in central china , south china and burma , while the allies crippled the japanese navy and captured key western pacific islands . [SEP]
[CLS] the war in europe concluded with an invasion of germany by the western allies and the soviet union , culminating in the capture of berlin by soviet troops , the suicide of adolf hitler and the german un ##con ##ditional surrender on 8 may 1945 . [SEP]
[CLS] following the potsdam declaration by the allies on 26 july 1945 and the refusal of japan to surrender under its terms , the united states dropped atomic bombs on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki on 6 and 9 august respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] tribunal ##s were set up by the allies and war crimes trials were conducted in the wake of the war both against the germans and the japanese . [SEP]
[CLS] the united nations ( un ) was established to foster international co - operation and prevent future conflicts ; the victorious great powers — china , france , the soviet union , the united kingdom , and the united states — became the permanent members of its security council . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet union and united states emerged as rival super ##power ##s , setting the stage for the nearly half - century long cold war . [SEP]
[CLS] in the wake of european devastation , the influence of its great powers wan ##ed , triggering the deco ##lon ##isation of africa and asia . [SEP]
[CLS] the start of the war in europe is generally held to be 1 september 1939 , beginning with the german invasion of poland ; the united kingdom and france declared war on germany two days later . [SEP]

[CLS] the british historian antony bee ##vor views the beginning of world war ii as the battles of k ##hal ##kh ##in go ##l fought between japan and the forces of mongolia and the soviet union from may to september 1939 . [SEP]
[CLS] the exact date of the war ' s end is also not universally agreed upon . [SEP]
[CLS] a treaty regarding germany ' s future allowed the reunification of east and west germany to take place in 1990 and resolved most post - world war ii issues . [SEP]
[CLS] world war i had radically altered the political european map , with the defeat of the central powers — including austria - hungary , germany , bulgaria and the ottoman empire — and the 1917 bolshevik seizure of power in russia , which eventually led to the founding of the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , the victorious allies of world war i , such as france , belgium , italy , romania and greece , gained territory , and new nation - states were created out of the collapse of austria - hungary and the ottoman and russian empires . [SEP]
[CLS] the organisation ' s primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security , military and naval di ##sar ##mament , and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration . [SEP]
[CLS] despite strong pac ##if ##ist sentiment after world war i , its aftermath still caused ir ##red ##ent ##ist and rev ##an ##chi ##st nationalism in several european states . [SEP]
[CLS] these sentiments were especially marked in germany because of the significant territorial , colonial , and financial losses incurred by the treaty of versailles . [SEP]
[CLS] under the treaty , germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all of its overseas possessions , while german annexation of other states was prohibited , rep ##arat ##ions were imposed , and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country ' s armed forces . [SEP]
[CLS] the german empire was dissolved in the german revolution of 1918 – 1919 , and a democratic government , later known as the weimar republic , was created . [SEP]
[CLS] italy , as an en ##ten ##te ally , had made some post - war territorial gains ; however , italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by the united kingdom and france to secure italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1922 to 1925 , the fascist movement led by benito mussolini seized power in italy with a nationalist , total ##itarian , and class collaboration ##ist agenda that abolished representative democracy , rep ##ressed socialist , left - wing and liberal forces , and pursued an aggressive expansion ##ist foreign policy aimed at making italy a world power , promising the creation of a " new roman empire " . [SEP]
[CLS] adolf hitler , after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the german government in 1923 , eventually became the chancellor of germany in 1933 . [SEP]
[CLS] he abolished democracy , es ##po ##using a radical , racial ##ly motivated revision of the world order , and soon began a massive rear ##mament campaign . [SEP]
[CLS] the situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the territory of the sa ##ar basin was legally reunited with germany and hitler rep ##udi ##ated the treaty of versailles , accelerated his rear ##mament programme , and introduced conscription . [SEP]
[CLS] the united kingdom , france and italy formed the st ##res ##a front in april 1935 in order to contain germany , a key step towards military globalization ; however , that june , the united kingdom made an independent naval agreement with germany , easing prior restrictions . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet union , concerned by germany ' s goals of capturing vast areas of eastern europe , drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with france . [SEP]
[CLS] the united states , concerned with events in europe and asia , passed the neutrality act in august of the same year . [SEP]

[CLS] in 1931 , an increasingly mil ##ita ##rist ##ic empire of japan , which had long sought influence in china as the first step of what its government saw as the country ' s right to rule asia , used the mu ##k ##den incident as a pre ##text to launch an invasion of manchu ##ria and establish the puppet state of manchu ##ku ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] the war began with the invasion of the ethiopian empire ( also known as abyss ##inia ) by the armed forces of the kingdom of italy ( " reg ##no d ' italia " ) , which was launched from italian somali ##land and eritrea . [SEP]
[CLS] the war resulted in the military occupation of ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of italian east africa ( " africa oriental ##e italiana " , or ao ##i ) ; in addition it exposed the weakness of the league of nations as a force to preserve peace . [SEP]
[CLS] his greatest collaboration with germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the eastern front . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 1937 , japan captured the former chinese imperial capital of peking after ins ##ti ##gating the marco polo bridge incident , which culminated in the japanese campaign to invade all of china . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets quickly signed a non - aggression pact with china to lend mater ##iel support , effectively ending china ' s prior co - operation with germany . [SEP]
[CLS] after the fall of nan ##king , tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of chinese civilians and di ##sar ##med combatants were murdered by the japanese . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 1938 , chinese forces stalled the japanese advance by flooding the yellow river ; this man ##oe ##u ##vre bought time for the chinese to prepare their defences at wu ##han , but the city was taken by october . [SEP]
[CLS] japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of chinese resistance that japan had hoped to achieve ; instead the chinese government relocated inland to chong ##qing and continued the war . [SEP]
[CLS] in the mid - to - late 1930s , japanese forces in manchu ##ku ##o had sporadic border clashes with the soviet union and mongolia . [SEP]
[CLS] with the japanese defeat at k ##hal ##kin go ##l in 1939 , the ongoing second sino - japanese war and ally nazi germany pursuing neutrality with the soviets , this policy would prove difficult to maintain . [SEP]
[CLS] japan and the soviet union eventually signed a neutrality pact in april 1941 , and japan adopted the doctrine of nan ##shin - ron , promoted by the navy , which took its focus southward , eventually leading to its war with the united states and the western allies . [SEP]
[CLS] encouraged , hitler began pressing german claims on the sud ##ete ##nl ##and , an area of czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic german population . [SEP]
[CLS] soon the united kingdom and france followed the counsel of british prime minister neville chamberlain and conceded this territory to germany in the munich agreement , which was made against the wishes of the czechoslovak government , in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands . [SEP]
[CLS] although all of germany ' s stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement , privately hitler was furious that british interference had prevented him from seizing all of czechoslovakia in one operation . [SEP]
[CLS] in subsequent speeches hitler attacked british and jewish " war - mon ##gers " and in january 1939 secretly ordered a major build - up of the german navy to challenge british naval supremacy . [SEP]
[CLS] in march 1939 , germany invaded the remainder of czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the german protectorate of bohemia and mora ##via and a pro - german client state , the slovak republic . [SEP]
[CLS] greatly alarmed and with hitler making further demands on the free city of danzig , the united kingdom and france guaranteed their support for polish independence ; when italy conquered albania in april 1939 , the same guarantee was extended to romania and greece . [SEP]
[CLS] the situation reached a general crisis in late august as german troops continued to mob ##ilis ##e against the polish border . [SEP]
[CLS] this pact had a secret protocol that defined german and soviet " spheres of influence " ( western poland and lithuania for germany ; eastern poland , finland , estonia , latvia and be ##ssar ##abia for the soviet union ) , and raised the question of continuing polish independence . [SEP]
[CLS] immediately after that , hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 august , but upon hearing that the united kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with poland , and that italy would maintain neutrality , he decided to delay it . [SEP]
[CLS] in response to british requests for direct negotiations to avoid war , germany made demands on poland , which only served as a pre ##text to worse ##n relations . [SEP]
[CLS] on 29 august , hitler demanded that a polish pl ##eni ##pot ##ent ##iary immediately travel to berlin to negotiate the hand ##over of danzig , and to allow a pl ##eb ##is ##cite in the polish corridor in which the german minority would vote on secession . [SEP]
[CLS] the poles refused to comply with the german demands , and on the night of 30 – 31 august in a stormy meeting with the british ambassador neville henderson , rib ##ben ##tro ##p declared that germany considered its claims rejected . [SEP]
[CLS] on 1 september 1939 , germany invaded poland after having staged several false flag border incidents as a pre ##text to initiate the attack . [SEP]
[CLS] the united kingdom responded with an ultimatum to germany to cease military operations , and on 3 september , after the ultimatum was ignored , france , the united kingdom , australia , and new zealand declared war on germany . [SEP]
[CLS] the western allies also began a naval blockade of germany , which aimed to damage the country ' s economy and war effort . [SEP]
[CLS] germany responded by ordering u - boat warfare against allied merchant and warships , which would later es ##cala ##te into the battle of the atlantic . [SEP]
[CLS] the polish counter offensive to the west halted the german advance for several days , but it was out ##fl ##an ##ked and encircled by the " wehrmacht " . [SEP]
[CLS] on 17 september 1939 , after signing a cease - fire with japan , the soviets invaded eastern poland under a pre ##text that the polish state had ostensibly ceased to exist . [SEP]
[CLS] a significant part of polish military personnel evacuated to romania and the baltic countries ; many of them would fight against the axis in other theatres of the war . [SEP]
[CLS] germany annexed the western and occupied the central part of poland , and the soviet union annexed its eastern part ; small shares of polish territory were transferred to lithuania and slovakia . [SEP]
[CLS] on 6 october , hitler made a public peace overture to the united kingdom and france , but said that the future of poland was to be determined exclusively by germany and the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] the proposal was rejected , and hitler ordered an immediate offensive against france , which would be postponed until the spring of 1940 due to bad weather . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet union forced the baltic countries — estonia , latvia and lithuania , the states that were in the soviet " sphere of influence " under the mo ##lot ##ov - rib ##ben ##tro ##p pact — to sign " mutual assistance pact ##s " that stipulated station ##ing soviet troops in these countries . [SEP]
[CLS] finland refused to sign a similar pact and rejected ce ##ding part of its territory to the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] despite overwhelming numerical superiority , soviet military success was modest , and the finn ##o - soviet war ended in march 1940 with minimal finnish concessions . [SEP]
[CLS] in april 1940 , germany invaded denmark and norway to protect shipments of iron ore from sweden , which the allies were attempting to cut off . [SEP]
[CLS] to ci ##rc ##um ##vent the strong mag ##ino ##t line fortifications on the franco - german border , germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans carried out a flanking man ##oe ##u ##vre through the arden ##nes region , which was mistakenly perceived by allies as an imp ##ene ##tra ##ble natural barrier against armoured vehicles . [SEP]
[CLS] by successfully implementing new blitz ##kr ##ieg tactics , the " wehrmacht " rapidly advanced to the channel and cut off the allied forces in belgium , trapping the bulk of the allied armies in a ca ##uld ##ron on the franco - belgian border near lille . [SEP]
[CLS] the united kingdom was able to evacuate a significant number of allied troops from the continent by early june , although abandoning almost all of their equipment . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans turned south against the weakened french army , and paris fell to them on 14 ##jun ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] eight days later france signed an armistice with germany ; it was divided into german and italian occupation zones , and an uno ##cc ##up ##ied rum ##p state under the vichy regime , which , though officially neutral , was generally aligned with germany . [SEP]
[CLS] france kept its fleet , which the united kingdom attacked on 3 ##ju ##ly in an attempt to prevent its seizure by germany . [SEP]
[CLS] the united kingdom rejected hitler ' s ultimatum , and the german air superiority campaign started in august but failed to defeat raf fighter command . [SEP]
[CLS] the german strategic bombing offensive intensified with night attacks on london and other cities in the blitz , but failed to significantly disrupt the british war effort and largely ended in may 1941 . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 1939 , the united states was taking measures to assist china and the western allies , and amended the neutrality act to allow " cash and carry " purchases by the allies . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1940 , following the german capture of paris , the size of the united states navy was significantly increased . [SEP]
[CLS] in december 1940 roosevelt accused hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless , calling for the united states to become an " arsenal of democracy " and promoting lend - lease programmes of aid to support the british war effort . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of september 1940 , the trip ##art ##ite pact formally united japan , italy and germany as the axis powers . [SEP]
[CLS] romania and hungary would make major contributions to the axis war against the soviet union , in romania ' s case partially to recapture territory ceded to the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] in early june 1940 the italian " reg ##ia aero ##naut ##ica " attacked and besieged malta , a british possession . [SEP]
[CLS] in october italy attacked greece , but the attack was repulsed with heavy italian casualties ; the campaign ended within days with minor territorial changes . [SEP]
[CLS] germany started preparation for an invasion of the balkans to assist italy , to prevent the british from gaining a foot ##hold there , which would be a potential threat for romanian oil fields , and to strike against the british dominance of the mediterranean . [SEP]
[CLS] the offensive ##s were highly successful ; by early february 1941 italy had lost control of eastern libya , and large numbers of italian troops had been taken prisoner . [SEP]
[CLS] the italian navy also suffered significant defeats , with the royal navy putting three italian battleships out of commission by a carrier attack at tara ##nto and neutral ##ising several more warships at the battle of cape mata ##pan . [SEP]
[CLS] italian defeats prompted germany to deploy an expeditionary force to north africa , and at the end of march 1941 rom ##mel ' s af ##rika ko ##rp ##s launched an offensive which drove back the commonwealth forces . [SEP]
[CLS] in under a month , axis forces advanced to western egypt and besieged the port of to ##br ##uk . [SEP]
[CLS] germany responded with simultaneous invasions of both yugoslavia and greece , commencing on 6 april 1941 ; both nations were forced to surrender within the month . [SEP]
[CLS] the airborne invasion of the greek island of crete at the end of may completed the german conquest of the balkans . [SEP]
[CLS] in the middle east , in may commonwealth forces qu ##ash ##ed an uprising in iraq which had been supported by german aircraft from bases within vichy - controlled syria . [SEP]
[CLS] with the situation in europe and asia relatively stable , germany , japan , and the soviet union made preparations . [SEP]
[CLS] with the soviets wary of mounting tensions with germany and the japanese planning to take advantage of the european war by seizing resource - rich european possessions in southeast asia , the two powers signed the soviet – japanese neutrality pact in april 1941 . [SEP]
[CLS] by contrast , the germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the soviet union , mass ##ing forces on the soviet border . [SEP]
[CLS] hitler believed that the united kingdom ' s refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the united states and the soviet union would enter the war against germany sooner or later . [SEP]
[CLS] he therefore decided to try to strengthen germany ' s relations with the soviets , or failing that to attack and eliminate them as a factor . [SEP]
[CLS] in november 1940 , negotiations took place to determine if the soviet union would join the trip ##art ##ite pact . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets showed some interest , but asked for concessions from finland , bulgaria , turkey , and japan that germany considered unacceptable . [SEP]
[CLS] on 18 december 1940 , hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary targets of this surprise offensive were the baltic region , moscow and ukraine , with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the ark ##hang ##els ##k - as ##tra ##khan line , from the caspian to the white seas . [SEP]
[CLS] during the summer , the axis made significant gains into soviet territory , in ##flict ##ing immense losses in both personnel and mater ##iel . [SEP]
[CLS] by the middle of august , however , the german army high command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted army group centre , and to divert the 2nd panzer group to reinforce troops advancing towards central ukraine and leningrad . [SEP]
[CLS] the kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful , resulting in en ##ci ##rcle ##ment and elimination of four soviet armies , and made possible further advance into crimea and industrial ##ly developed eastern ukraine ( the first battle of k ##har ##kov ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in july , the uk and the soviet union formed a military alliance against germany the british and soviets invaded neutral iran to secure the persian corridor and iran ' s oil fields . [SEP]
[CLS] by october axis operational objectives in ukraine and the baltic region were achieved , with only the siege ##s of leningrad and se ##vas ##top ##ol continuing . [SEP]
[CLS] large territorial gains were made by axis forces , but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives : two key cities remained in soviet hands , the soviet capability to resist was not broken , and the soviet union retained a considerable part of its military potential . [SEP]
[CLS] this , as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of soviet troops in the east would be sufficient to deter any attack by the japanese kwan ##tung army , allowed the soviets to begin a massive counter - offensive that started on 5 december all along the front and pushed german troops 100 - west . [SEP]
[CLS] during this time , japan launched its first attack against chang ##sha , a strategically important chinese city , but was repulsed by late september . [SEP]
[CLS] to increase pressure on china by blocking supply routes , and to better position japanese forces in the event of a war with the western powers , japan invaded and occupied northern indochina . [SEP]
[CLS] afterwards , the united states em ##bar ##go ##ed iron , steel and mechanical parts against japan . [SEP]
[CLS] the dutch government agreed to provide japan some oil supplies from the dutch east indies , but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in june 1941 . [SEP]
[CLS] the united states , united kingdom and other western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on japanese assets and a total oil em ##bar ##go . [SEP]
[CLS] during these negotiations japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the americans as inadequate . [SEP]
[CLS] roosevelt reinforced the philippines ( an american protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946 ) and warned japan that the united states would react to japanese attacks against any " neighboring countries " . [SEP]
[CLS] it called for the end of american aid to china and for lifting the em ##bar ##go on the supply of oil and other resources to japan . [SEP]
[CLS] that meant japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in china , or seizing the natural resources it needed in the dutch east indies by force ; the japanese military did not consider the former an option , and many officers considered the oil em ##bar ##go an unspoken declaration of war . [SEP]
[CLS] to prevent american intervention while securing the perimeter , it was further planned to neutral ##ise the united states pacific fleet and the american military presence in the philippines from the outset . [SEP]
[CLS] on 7 december 1941 ( 8 december in asian time zones ) , japan attacked british and american holdings with near - simultaneous offensive ##s against southeast asia and the central pacific . [SEP]
[CLS] these attacks led the united states , united kingdom , china , australia and several other states to formally declare war on japan , whereas the soviet union , being heavily involved in large - scale hostilities with european axis countries , maintained its neutrality agreement with japan . [SEP]
[CLS] germany , followed by the other axis states , declared war on the united states in solidarity with japan , citing as justification the american attacks on german war vessels that had been ordered by roosevelt . [SEP]
[CLS] on 1 january 1942 , the allied big four — the soviet union , china , the united kingdom and the united states — and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the declaration by united nations , thereby af ##firm ##ing the atlantic charter , and agreeing to not to sign a separate peace with the axis powers . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , the british persuaded the americans that a landing in france was in ##fe ##asi ##ble in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the axis out of north africa . [SEP]
[CLS] the british and americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the mediterranean by invading sicily to fully secure the mediterranean supply routes . [SEP]
[CLS] although the british argued for further operations in the balkans to bring turkey into the war , in may 1943 , the americans extracted a british commitment to limit allied operations in the mediterranean to an invasion of the italian mainland and to invade france in 1944 . [SEP]
[CLS] despite stubborn resistance by filipino and us forces , the philippine commonwealth was eventually captured in may 1942 , forcing its government into exile . [SEP]
[CLS] on 16 april , in burma , 7 , 000 british soldiers were encircled by the japanese 33rd division during the battle of yen ##ang ##ya ##ung and rescued by the chinese 38th division . [SEP]
[CLS] the planned invasion was thwarted when an allied task force , centred on two american fleet carriers , fought japanese naval forces to a draw in the battle of the coral sea . [SEP]
[CLS] in early june , japan put its operations into action , but the americans , having broken japanese naval codes in late may , were fully aware of the plans and order of battle , and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at midway over the imperial japanese navy . [SEP]
[CLS] the americans planned a counter - attack against japanese positions in the southern solomon islands , primarily gu ##ada ##lc ##anal , as a first step towards capturing ra ##bau ##l , the main japanese base in southeast asia . [SEP]
[CLS] both plans started in july , but by mid - september , the battle for gu ##ada ##lc ##anal took priority for the japanese , and troops in new guinea were ordered to withdraw from the port more ##sby area to the northern part of the island , where they faced australian and united states troops in the battle of bun ##a - go ##na . [SEP]
[CLS] the second was the insertion of irregular forces behind japanese front - lines in february which , by the end of april , had achieved mixed results . [SEP]
[CLS] despite considerable losses , in early 1942 germany and its allies stopped a major soviet offensive in central and southern russia , keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year . [SEP]
[CLS] in may the germans defeated soviet offensive ##s in the ke ##rch peninsula and at k ##har ##kov , and then launched their main summer offensive against southern russia in june 1942 , to seize the oil fields of the caucasus and occupy ku ##ban steppe , while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets began their second winter counter - offensive , starting with an en ##ci ##rcle ##ment of german forces at stalin ##grad , and an assault on the r ##zh ##ev sal ##ient near moscow , though the latter failed disastrous ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] by early february 1943 , the german army had taken tremendous losses ; german troops at stalin ##grad had been forced to surrender , and the front - line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive . [SEP]
[CLS] in mid - february , after the soviet push had tape ##red off , the germans launched another attack on k ##har ##kov , creating a sal ##ient in their front line around the soviet city of ku ##rsk . [SEP]
[CLS] by november 1941 , commonwealth forces had launched a counter - offensive , operation crusader , in north africa , and reclaimed all the gains the germans and italians had made . [SEP]
[CLS] in north africa , the germans launched an offensive in january , pushing the british back to positions at the gaza ##la line by early february , followed by a temporary lu ##ll in combat which germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensive ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] on the continent , raids of allied commandos on strategic targets , culminating in the disastrous die ##ppe raid , demonstrated the western allies ' inability to launch an invasion of continental europe without much better preparation , equipment , and operational security . [SEP]
[CLS] a few months later , the allies commenced an attack of their own in egypt , di ##sl ##od ##ging the axis forces and beginning a drive west across libya . [SEP]
[CLS] hitler responded to the french colony ' s defect ##ion by ordering the occupation of vichy france ; although vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice , they managed to sc ##ut ##tle their fleet to prevent its capture by german forces . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 1943 the british and americans began a strategic bombing campaign against germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy , reduce morale , and " de - house " the civilian population . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 1943 , canadian and us forces were sent to eliminate japanese forces from the ale ##uti ##ans . [SEP]
[CLS] soon after , the united states , with support from australian and new zealand forces , began major operations to isolate ra ##bau ##l by capturing surrounding islands , and breach the japanese central pacific perimeter at the gilbert and marshall islands . [SEP]
[CLS] in april , the allies launched an operation to re ##take western new guinea . [SEP]
[CLS] in the soviet union , both the germans and the soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensive ##s in central russia . [SEP]
[CLS] this decision was partially affected by the western allies ' invasion of sicily launched on 9 july , which , combined with previous italian failures , resulted in the ou ##sti ##ng and arrest of mussolini later that month . [SEP]
[CLS] on 12 july 1943 , the soviets launched their own counter - offensive ##s , thereby di ##sp ##elling any chance of german victory or even stale ##mate in the east . [SEP]
[CLS] the germans tried to stab ##ilis ##e their eastern front along the hastily fortified panther – wo ##tan line , but the soviets broke through it at sm ##ole ##nsk and by the lower d ##nie ##per offensive ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] germany with the help of fascist ##s responded by di ##sar ##ming italian forces that were in many places without superior orders , seizing military control of italian areas , and creating a series of defensive lines . [SEP]
[CLS] german special forces then rescued mussolini , who then soon established a new client state in german - occupied italy named the italian social republic , causing an italian civil war . [SEP]
[CLS] by may 1943 , as allied counter - measures became increasingly effective , the resulting size ##able german submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the german atlantic naval campaign . [SEP]
[CLS] the former conference determined the post - war return of japanese territory and the military planning for the burma campaign , while the latter included agreement that the western allies would invade europe in 1944 and that the soviet union would declare war on japan within three months of germany ' s defeat . [SEP]
[CLS] from november 1943 , during the seven - week battle of chang ##de , the chinese forced japan to fight a costly war of at ##tri ##tion , while awaiting allied relief . [SEP]
[CLS] on 27 january 1944 , soviet troops launched a major offensive that expelled german forces from the leningrad region , thereby ending the longest and most lethal siege in history . [SEP]
[CLS] the following soviet offensive was halted on the pre - war estonian border by the german army group north aided by estonian ##s hoping to re - establish national independence . [SEP]
[CLS] by late may 1944 , the soviets had liberated crimea , largely expelled axis forces from ukraine , and made inc ##urs ##ions into romania , which were repulsed by the axis troops . [SEP]
[CLS] the allied offensive ##s in italy had succeeded and , at the expense of allowing several german divisions to retreat , on 4 june , rome was captured . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 1944 , british forces mounted a counter - offensive that drove japanese troops back to burma by july , and chinese forces that had invaded northern burma in late 1943 besieged japanese troops in my ##it ##ky ##ina . [SEP]
[CLS] the second japanese invasion of china aimed to destroy china ' s main fighting forces , secure railways between japanese - held territory and capture allied airfields . [SEP]
[CLS] these landings were successful , and led to the defeat of the german army units in france . [SEP]
[CLS] paris was liberated on 25 august by the local resistance assisted by the free french forces , both led by general charles de gaulle , and the western allies continued to push back german forces in western europe during the latter part of the year . [SEP]
[CLS] after that , the western allies slowly pushed into germany , but failed to cross the ru ##hr river in a large offensive . [SEP]
[CLS] on 22 june , the soviets launched a strategic offensive in belarus ( " operation bag ##ration " ) that destroyed the german army group centre almost completely . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviets formed the polish committee of national liberation to control territory in poland and combat the polish arm ##ia k ##raj ##owa ; the soviet red army remained in the pr ##aga district on the other side of the vis ##tula and watched passive ##ly as the germans que ##lled the warsaw uprising initiated by the arm ##ia k ##raj ##owa . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet red army ' s strategic offensive in eastern romania cut off and destroyed the considerable german troops there and triggered a successful coup d ' etat in romania and in bulgaria , followed by those countries ' shift to the allied side . [SEP]
[CLS] in september 1944 , soviet troops advanced into yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of german army groups e and f in greece , albania and yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off . [SEP]
[CLS] by this point , the communist - led partisans under marshal jo ##si ##p bro ##z tito , who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941 , controlled much of the territory of yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against german forces further south . [SEP]
[CLS] in northern serbia , the soviet red army , with limited support from bulgarian forces , assisted the partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of belgrade on 20 october . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike impressive soviet victories in the balkans , bitter finnish resistance to the soviet offensive in the karel ##ian ist ##hm ##us denied the soviets occupation of finland and led to a soviet - finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions , although finland was forced to fight their former ally germany . [SEP]
[CLS] by the start of july 1944 , commonwealth forces in southeast asia had rep ##elled the japanese siege ##s in assam , pushing the japanese back to the chin ##d ##win river while the chinese captured my ##it ##ky ##ina . [SEP]
[CLS] soon after , they invaded the province of gu ##ang ##xi , winning major engagements against chinese forces at gui ##lin and liu ##zhou by the end of november and successfully linking up their forces in china and indochina by mid - december . [SEP]
[CLS] on 16 december 1944 , germany made a last attempt on the western front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter - offensive in the arden ##nes and along the french – german border to split the western allies , en ##ci ##rcle large portions of western allied troops and capture their primary supply port at antwerp to prompt a political settlement . [SEP]
[CLS] in mid - january 1945 , the soviets and poles attacked in poland , pushing from the vis ##tula to the oder river in germany , and over ##ran east prussia . [SEP]
[CLS] in early march , in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in hungary and to re ##take budapest , germany launched its last major offensive against soviet troops near lake bala ##ton . [SEP]
[CLS] american and soviet forces met at the el ##be river on 25 april , leaving several uno ##cc ##up ##ied pockets in southern germany and around berlin . [SEP]
[CLS] two days later , hitler committed suicide in besieged berlin , and he was succeeded by grand admiral karl don ##itz . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , the united states army air forces launched a massive fire ##bo ##mb ##ing campaign of strategic cities in japan in an effort to destroy japanese war industry and civilian morale . [SEP]
[CLS] chinese forces started a counterattack in the battle of west hunan that occurred between 6 april and 7 june 1945 . [SEP]
[CLS] they confirmed earlier agreements about germany , and the american , british and chinese governments reiterated the demand for un ##con ##ditional surrender of japan , specifically stating that " the alternative for japan is prompt and utter destruction " . [SEP]
[CLS] the call for un ##con ##ditional surrender was rejected by the japanese government , which believed it would be capable of negotiating for more favourable surrender terms . [SEP]
[CLS] in early august , the united states dropped atomic bombs on the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki . [SEP]
[CLS] between the two bombings , the soviets , pursuant to the ya ##lta agreement , invaded japanese - held manchu ##ria and quickly defeated the kwan ##tung army , which was the largest japanese fighting force , thereby per ##su ##ading previously adamant imperial army leaders to accept surrender terms . [SEP]
[CLS] on 15 august 1945 , japan surrendered , with the surrender documents finally signed at tokyo bay on the deck of the american battleship uss " missouri " on 2 september 1945 , ending the war . [SEP]
[CLS] the latter was divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the western allies and the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] a den ##azi ##fication programme in germany led to the prosecution of nazi war criminals in the nuremberg trials and the removal of ex - nazis from power , although this policy moved towards amnesty and re - integration of ex - nazis into west german society . [SEP]
[CLS] among the eastern territories , silesia , ne ##uma ##rk and most of pomerania were taken over by poland , and east prussia was divided between poland and the soviet union , followed by the expulsion to germany of the nine million germans from these provinces , as well as three million germans from the sud ##ete ##nl ##and in czechoslovakia . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet union also took over the polish provinces east of the cu ##rz ##on line , from which 2 million poles were expelled ; north - east romania , parts of eastern finland , and the three baltic states were incorporated into the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] in an effort to maintain world peace , the allies formed the united nations , which officially came into existence on 24 october 1945 , and adopted the universal declaration of human rights in 1948 as a common standard for all member nations . [SEP]
[CLS] the great powers that were the victor ##s of the war — france , china , the united kingdom , the soviet union and the united states — became the permanent members of the un ' s security council . [SEP]
[CLS] the five permanent members remain so to the present , although there have been two seat changes , between the republic of china and the people ' s republic of china in 1971 , and between the soviet union and its successor state , the russian federation , following the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 . [SEP]
[CLS] germany had been " de facto " divided , and two independent states , the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic , were created within the borders of allied and soviet occupation zones . [SEP]
[CLS] most eastern and central european countries fell into the soviet sphere , which led to establishment of communist - led regimes , with full or partial support of the soviet occupation authorities . [SEP]
[CLS] the long period of political tensions and military competition between them , the cold war , would be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and proxy wars . [SEP]
[CLS] in asia , the united states led the occupation of japan and ad ##mini ##stra ##ted japan ' s former islands in the western pacific , while the soviets annexed sa ##kha ##lin and the ku ##ril islands . [SEP]
[CLS] korea , formerly under japanese rule , was divided and occupied by the soviet union in the north and the united states in the south between 1945 and 1948 . [SEP]
[CLS] communist forces were victorious and established the people ' s republic of china on the mainland , while nationalist forces retreated to taiwan in 1949 . [SEP]
[CLS] in the middle east , the arab rejection of the united nations partition plan for palestine and the creation of israel marked the es ##cala ##tion of the arab – israeli conflict . [SEP]
[CLS] while european powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires , their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful , leading to deco ##lon ##isation . [SEP]
[CLS] the united states emerged much richer than any other nation , leading to a baby boom , and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers , and it dominated the world economy . [SEP]
[CLS] recovery began with the mid - 1948 currency reform in western germany , and was sped up by the liberal ##isation of european economic policy that the marshall plan ( 1948 – 1951 ) both directly and indirectly caused . [SEP]
[CLS] by contrast , the united kingdom was in a state of economic ruin , and although receiving a quarter of the total marshall plan assistance , more than any other european country , it continued in relative economic decline for decades . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet union , despite enormous human and material losses , also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate post - war era . [SEP]
[CLS] japan experienced incredibly rapid economic growth , becoming one of the most powerful economies in the world by the 1980s . [SEP]
[CLS] estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary , because many deaths went un ##re ##cor ##ded . [SEP]
[CLS] of the total number of deaths in world war ii , approximately 85 per cent — mostly soviet and chinese — were on the allied side . [SEP]
[CLS] the most infamous japanese at ##rocity was the nan ##king massacre , in which fifty to three hundred thousand chinese civilians were raped and murdered . [SEP]
[CLS] both the germans and japanese tested such weapons against civilians , and sometimes on prisoners of war . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet union was responsible for the katy ##n massacre of 22 , 000 polish officers , and the imprisonment or execution of thousands of political prisoners by the nk ##vd , along with mass civilian deportation ##s to siberia , in the baltic states and eastern poland annexed by the red army . [SEP]
[CLS] the mass - bombing of cities in europe and asia has often been called a war crime , although no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or during world war ii . [SEP]
[CLS] nazi germany was responsible for the holocaust ( killing approximately 6 million jews ) , as well as for killing 2 . 7 million ethnic poles and 4 million others who were deemed " un ##worthy of life " ( including the disabled and mentally ill , soviet prisoners of war , romani , homosexual ##s , free ##mas ##ons , and je ##ho ##vah ' s witnesses ) as part of a programme of deliberate ex ##ter ##mina ##tion , in effect becoming a " gen ##oc ##idal state " . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet gu ##lag became a " de facto " system of deadly camps during 1942 – 43 , when wartime pri ##vation and hunger caused numerous deaths of inmates , including foreign citizens of poland and other countries occupied in 1939 – 40 by the soviet union , as well as axis pow ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of the war , most soviet pow ##s liberated from nazi camps and many rep ##at ##riated civilians were detained in special fi ##lt ##ration camps where they were subjected to nk ##vd evaluation , and 226 , 127 were sent to the gu ##lag as real or perceived nazi collaborators . [SEP]
[CLS] the international military tribunal for the far east found the death rate of western prisoners was 27 . 1 per cent ( for american pow ##s , 37 per cent ) , seven times that of pow ##s under the germans and italians . [SEP]
[CLS] at least five million chinese civilians from northern china and manchu ##ku ##o were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the east asia development board , or " ko ##ain " , for work in mines and war industries . [SEP]
[CLS] in western , northern , and central europe ( france , norway , denmark , the low countries , and the annexed portions of czechoslovakia ) germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69 . 5 billion reich ##marks ( 27 . 8 billion us dollars ) by the end of the war ; this figure does not include the size ##able pl ##under of industrial products , military equipment , raw materials and other goods . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the income from occupied nations was over 40 per cent of the income germany collected from taxation , a figure which increased to nearly 40 per cent of total german income as the war went on . [SEP]
[CLS] in the east , the intended gains of " le ##ben ##sr ##au ##m " were never attained as flu ##ct ##uating front - lines and soviet sc ##or ##ched earth policies denied resources to the german invaders . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike in the west , the nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the " inferior people " of slavic descent ; most german advances were thus followed by mass executions . [SEP]
[CLS] although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories , they did not significantly ham ##per german operations in either the east or the west until late 1943 . [SEP]
[CLS] in asia , japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the greater east asia co - prosperity sphere , essentially a japanese he ##ge ##mony which it claimed was for purposes of li ##ber ##ating colon ##ised peoples . [SEP]
[CLS] although japanese forces were originally welcomed as li ##ber ##ators from european domination in some territories , their excessive brutality turned local public opinion against them within weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] in europe , before the outbreak of the war , the allies had significant advantages in both population and economics . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1938 , the western allies ( united kingdom , france , poland and british dominion ##s ) had a 30 per cent larger population and a 30 per cent higher gross domestic product than the european axis powers ( germany and italy ) ; if colonies are included , it then gives the allies more than a 5 : 1 advantage in population and nearly 2 : 1 advantage in gdp . [SEP]
[CLS] in asia at the same time , china had roughly six times the population of japan , but only an 89 per cent higher gdp ; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 per cent higher gdp if japanese colonies are included . [SEP]
[CLS] though the allies ' economic and population advantages were largely mit ##igate ##d during the initial rapid blitz ##kr ##ieg attacks of germany and japan , they became the decisive factor by 1942 , after the united states and soviet union joined the allies , as the war largely settled into one of at ##tri ##tion . [SEP]
[CLS] while the allies ' ability to out - produce the axis is often attributed to the allies having more access to natural resources , other factors , such as germany and japan ' s reluctance to employ women in the labour force , allied strategic bombing , and germany ' s late shift to a war economy contributed significantly . [SEP]
[CLS] innovation included airlift ( the capability to quickly move limited high - priority supplies , equipment , and personnel ) ; and of strategic bombing ( the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy ' s ability to wage war ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and , though late introduction meant it had little impact , it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] in the atlantic , escort carriers proved to be a vital part of allied convoys , increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the mid - atlantic gap . [SEP]
[CLS] submarines , which had proved to be an effective weapon during the first world war , were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late 1930s , tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during world war i , and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed , armour and fire ##power . [SEP]
[CLS] this idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour , and german doctrine of avoiding tank - versus - tank combat . [SEP]
[CLS] this , along with germany ' s use of combined arms , were among the key elements of their highly successful blitz ##kr ##ieg tactics across poland and france . [SEP]
[CLS] even with large - scale me ##chan ##isation , infantry remained the backbone of all forces , and throughout the war , most infantry were equipped similarly to world war i . [SEP]
[CLS] the portable machine gun spread , a notable example being the german mg ##34 , and various sub ##mac ##hine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings . [SEP]
[CLS] the assault rifle , a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and sub ##mac ##hine gun , became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces . [SEP]
[CLS] most major bell ##iger ##ents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large code ##books for crypt ##ography by designing cipher ##ing machines , the most well known being the german enigma machine . [SEP]
[CLS] notable examples were the allied dec ##ry ##ption of japanese naval codes and british ultra , a pioneering method for deco ##ding enigma benefit ##ing from information given to the united kingdom by the polish cipher bureau , which had been deco ##ding early versions of enigma before the war . [SEP]
[CLS] another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception , which the allies used to great effect , such as in operations min ##ce ##me ##at and bodyguard . [SEP]
[CLS] other technological and engineering feat ##s achieved during , or as a result of , the war include the world ' s first program ##mable computers ( z ##3 , col ##oss ##us , and en ##iac ) , guided missiles and modern rockets , the manhattan project ' s development of nuclear weapons , operations research and the development of artificial harbour ##s and oil pipeline ##s under the english channel .
