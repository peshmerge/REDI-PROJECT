of the total number of deaths in world war ii , approximately 85 % — mostly soviet and chinese — were on the allied side .
the most infamous japanese atrocity was the nanking massacre , in which fifty to three hundred thousand chinese civilians were murdered .
both the germans and japanese tested such weapons against civilians , and sometimes on prisoners of war .
the soviet union was responsible for the katyn massacre of 22,000 polish officers , and the imprisonment or execution of thousands of political prisoners by the nkvd , along with mass civilian deportations to siberia , in the baltic states and eastern poland annexed by the red army .

before the war , the allies had a lot of advantages in both population and economics .
if colonies are included , it then gives the allies more than a 5 : 1 advantage in population and nearly 2 .
in asia at the same time , china had roughly six times the population of japan , but only an 89 % higher gdp .
the allies ' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid rapid blitzkrieg attacks of germany and japan .
the allies ' ability to out-produce the axis is often because they have more access to natural resources .
the allies also made strategic bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy 's ability to wage war ashore .

this idea was challenged by the poor performance of the tank guns against armour .
this was a successful tactickrieg tactics across poland and france .
even with large-scale mechanisation , infantry remained the backbone of all forces , and throughout the war , most infantry were equipped similarly to world war i .
the portable machine gun spread , a notable example being the german mg34 , and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings .
the assault rifle was a standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces .
most of the major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security .
notable examples were the allied decryption of japanese naval codes and british ultra , a pioneering method for decoding enigma benefiting from information given to the united kingdom by the polish cipher bureau , which had been decoding early versions of enigma before the war .
another part of military intelligence was the use of deception , which the allies used to great effect , such as in operations mincemeat and bodyguard .
other technological and engineering feats achieved during the war include the world 's first programmable computersttered z3 , colossus , and eniaceux , guided missiles and modern rockets , the manhattan project 's development of nuclear weapons , operations research and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the english channel .
