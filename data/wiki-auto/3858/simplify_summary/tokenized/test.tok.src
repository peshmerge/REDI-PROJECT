[CLS] mvp voting takes place before the postseason , but the results are not announced until after the world series . [SEP]
[CLS] the bb ##wa ##a began by polling three writers in each league city in 1938 , reducing that number to two per league city in 1961 . [SEP]
[CLS] the bb ##wa ##a does not offer a clear - cut definition of what " most valuable " means , instead leaving the judgment to the individual voters . [SEP]

[CLS] the national league went even longer without an mvp award to a pitcher . [SEP]

[CLS] before the 1910 season , hugh chalmers of chalmers automobile announced he would present a chalmers model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average in major league baseball at the end of the season . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1910 race for best average in the american league was between the detroit tigers ' widely disliked ty cobb and nap la ##jo ##ie of the cleveland indians . [SEP]
[CLS] on the last day of the season , la ##jo ##ie overtook cobb ' s batting average with seven bun ##t hits against the st . louis browns . [SEP]
[CLS] american league president ban johnson said a rec ##al ##cula ##tion showed that cobb had won the race anyway , and chalmers ended up awarding cars to both players . [SEP]
[CLS] the following season , chalmers created the chalmers award . [SEP]
[CLS] a committee of baseball writers were to con ##ven ##e after the season to determine the " most important and useful player to the club and to the league " . [SEP]
[CLS] since the award was not as effective at advertising as chalmers had hoped , it was discontinued after 1914 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1922 the american league created a new award to honor " the baseball player who is of the greatest all - around service to his club " . [SEP]
[CLS] winners , voted on by a committee of eight baseball writers chaired by james cr ##us ##in ##berry , received a bronze medal and a cash prize . [SEP]
[CLS] voters were required to select one player from each team and player - coaches and prior award winners were ineligible . [SEP]
[CLS] famously , these criteria resulted in babe ruth winning only a single mvp award before it was dropped after 1928 . [SEP]
[CLS] the national league award , without these restrictions , lasted from 1924 to 1929 . [SEP]
[CLS] the bb ##wa ##a first awarded the modern mvp after the 1931 season , adopting the format the national league used to distribute its league award . [SEP]
[CLS] one writer in each city with a team filled out a ten - place ballot , with ten points for the recipient of a first - place vote , nine for a second - place vote , and so on . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1938 , the bb ##wa ##a raised the number of voters to three per city and gave 14 points for a first - place vote . [SEP]
[CLS] the only significant change since then occurred in 1961 , when the number of voters was reduced to two per league city . [SEP]
