[CLS] writing is a medium of human communication that represents language with signs and symbols . [SEP]
[CLS] for languages that utilize a writing system , inscriptions can complement spoken language by creating a durable version of speech that can be stored for future reference or transmitted across distance . [SEP]
[CLS] writing , in other words , is not a language , but a tool used to make languages read ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] within a language system , writing relies on many of the same structures as speech , such as vocabulary , grammar , and semantics , with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols . [SEP]
[CLS] the result of writing is called " text " , and the recipient of text is called a " reader " . [SEP]
[CLS] h . g . wells argued that writing has the ability to " put agreements , laws , command ##ments on record . [SEP]
[CLS] it made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible . [SEP]
[CLS] it made a continuous historical consciousness possible . [SEP]
[CLS] the command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death " . [SEP]
[CLS] as human societies emerged , collective motivation ##s for the development of writing were driven by pr ##ag ##matic ex ##igen ##cies like keeping history , maintaining culture , cod ##ifying knowledge through cu ##rri ##cula and lists of texts deemed to contain foundation ##al knowledge ( e . g . , " the canon of medicine " ) or artistic ##ally exceptional ( e . g . , a literary canon ) , organizing and governing societies through the formation of legal systems , census records , contracts , deeds of ownership , taxation , trade agreements , treaties , and so on . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , around the 4th millennium bc , the complexity of trade and administration in mesopotamia out ##gre ##w human memory , and writing became a more depend ##able method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form . [SEP]
[CLS] in both ancient egypt and me ##so ##ame ##rica , on the other hand , writing may have evolved through cale ##nd ##ric and political nec ##ess ##ities for recording historical and environmental events . [SEP]
[CLS] individual motivation ##s for writing include improvised additional capacity for the limitations of human memory ( e . g . , to - do lists , recipes , reminder ##s , log ##books , maps , the proper sequence for a complicated task or important ritual ) , dissemination of ideas ( as in an essay , monograph , broad ##side , petition , or manifesto ) , imaginative narratives and other forms of storytelling , personal or business correspondence , and life ##writing ( e . g . , a diary or journal ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the major writing systems — methods of inscription — broadly fall into five categories : logo ##graphic , sy ##lla ##bic , alphabet ##ic , feat ##ural , and id ##eo ##graphic ( symbols for ideas ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a sixth category , pic ##to ##graphic , is insufficient to represent language on its own , but often forms the core of logo ##graph ##ies . [SEP]
[CLS] a logo ##gram is a written character which represents a word or mor ##ph ##eme . [SEP]
[CLS] a vast number of logo ##gram ##s are needed to write chinese characters , cu ##ne ##iform , and maya ##n , where a g ##ly ##ph may stand for a mor ##ph ##eme , a syllable , or both — ( " logo ##con ##son ##anta ##l " in the case of hi ##ero ##gly ##phs ) . [SEP]
[CLS] many logo ##gram ##s have an id ##eo ##graphic component ( chinese " radicals " , hi ##ero ##gly ##phic " determine ##rs " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in maya ##n , the g ##ly ##ph for " fin " , pronounced " ka " , was also used to represent the syllable " ka " whenever the pronunciation of a logo ##gram needed to be indicated , or when there was no logo ##gram . [SEP]
[CLS] in chinese , about 90 % of characters are compounds of a semantic ( meaning ) element called a " radical " with an existing character to indicate the pronunciation , called a " phonetic " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , such phonetic elements complement the logo ##graphic elements , rather than vice versa . [SEP]
[CLS] the main logo ##graphic system in use today is chinese characters , used with some modification for the various languages or dialects of china , japan , and sometimes in korean despite the fact that in south and north korea , the phonetic hangul system is mainly used . [SEP]
[CLS] a sy ##lla ##bar ##y is a set of written symbols that represent ( or approximate ) syllables . [SEP]
[CLS] a g ##ly ##ph in a sy ##lla ##bar ##y typically represents a consonant followed by a vowel , or just a vowel alone , though in some scripts more complex syllables ( such as consonant - vowel - consonant , or consonant - consonant - vowel ) may have dedicated g ##ly ##phs . [SEP]
[CLS] phonetic ##ally related syllables are not so indicated in the script . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , the syllable " ka " may look nothing like the syllable " ki " , nor will syllables with the same vowels be similar . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##lla ##bari ##es are best suited to languages with a relatively simple syllable structure , such as japanese . [SEP]
[CLS] other languages that use sy ##lla ##bic writing include the linear b script for my ##cen ##aea ##n greek ; se ##qu ##oya ##n , n ##d ##ju ##ka , an english - based creole language of sur ##ina ##m ; and the va ##i script of liberia . [SEP]
[CLS] most logo ##graphic systems have a strong sy ##lla ##bic component . [SEP]
[CLS] et ##hi ##op ##ic , though technically an abu ##gi ##da , has fused consonants and vowels together to the point where it is learned as if it were a sy ##lla ##bar ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] an alphabet is a set of symbols , each of which represents or historically represented a phone ##me of the language . [SEP]
[CLS] in a perfectly ph ##ono ##logical alphabet , the phone ##mes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions : a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation , and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling . [SEP]
[CLS] as languages often evolve independently of their writing systems , and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for , the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phone ##mes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language . [SEP]
[CLS] in most of the writing systems of the middle east , it is usually only the consonants of a word that are written , although vowels may be indicated by the addition of various dia ##cr ##itical marks . [SEP]
[CLS] writing systems based primarily on marking the consonant phone ##mes alone date back to the hi ##ero ##gly ##phs of ancient egypt . [SEP]
[CLS] such systems are called " ab ##jad ##s " , derived from the arabic word for " alphabet " . [SEP]
[CLS] in most of the alphabet ##s of india and southeast asia , vowels are indicated through dia ##cr ##itic ##s or modification of the shape of the consonant . [SEP]
[CLS] these are called " abu ##gi ##das " . [SEP]
[CLS] some abu ##gi ##das , such as et ##hi ##op ##ic and cree , are learned by children as sy ##lla ##bari ##es , and so are often called " sy ##lla ##bic ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , unlike true sy ##lla ##bari ##es , there is not an independent g ##ly ##ph for each syllable . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes the term " alphabet " is restricted to systems with separate letters for consonants and vowels , such as the latin alphabet , although abu ##gi ##das and ab ##jad ##s may also be accepted as alphabet ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] because of this use , greek is often considered to be the first alphabet . [SEP]
[CLS] a feat ##ural script not ##ates in an internally consistent way the building blocks of the phone ##mes that make up a language . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , all sounds pronounced with the lips ( " lab ##ial " sounds ) may have some element in common . [SEP]
[CLS] in the latin alphabet , this is accidentally the case with the letters " b " and " p " ; however , lab ##ial " m " is completely di ##ssi ##mi ##lar , and the similar - looking " q " and " d " are not lab ##ial . [SEP]
[CLS] in korean hangul , however , all four lab ##ial consonants are based on the same basic element , but in practice , korean is learned by children as an ordinary alphabet , and the feat ##ural elements tend to pass unnoticed . [SEP]
[CLS] another feat ##ural script is sign ##writing , the most popular writing system for many sign languages , where the shapes and movements of the hands and face are represented iconic ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] feat ##ural scripts are also common in fictional or invented systems , such as j . r . r . tolkien ' s ten ##g ##war . [SEP]
[CLS] historians draw a sharp distinction between pre ##his ##tory and history , with history defined by the advent of writing . [SEP]
[CLS] the cave paintings and pet ##ro ##gly ##phs of prehistoric peoples can be considered precursor ##s of writing , but they are not considered true writing because they did not represent language directly . [SEP]
[CLS] writing systems develop and change based on the needs of the people who use them . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes the shape , orientation , and meaning of individual signs changes over time . [SEP]
[CLS] by tracing the development of a script , it is possible to learn about the needs of the people who used the script as well as how the script changed over time . [SEP]
[CLS] the many tools and writing materials used throughout history include stone tablets , clay tablets , bamboo sl ##ats , papyrus , wax tablets , ve ##llum , parchment , paper , copper ##plate , st ##ylus ##es , qui ##lls , ink brushes , pencil ##s , pens , and many styles of lit ##hog ##raphy . [SEP]
[CLS] the inca ##s used knotted cords known as qui ##pu ( or k ##hip ##u ) for keeping records . [SEP]
[CLS] the type ##writer and various forms of word processors have subsequently become widespread writing tools , and various studies have compared the ways in which writers have framed the experience of writing with such tools as compared with the pen or pencil . [SEP]
[CLS] while neolithic writing is a current research topic , conventional history assumes that the writing process first evolved from economic necessity in the ancient near east . [SEP]
[CLS] writing most likely began as a consequence of political expansion in ancient cultures , which needed reliable means for transmitting information , maintaining financial accounts , keeping historical records , and similar activities . [SEP]
[CLS] around the 4th millennium bc , the complexity of trade and administration out ##gre ##w the power of memory , and writing became a more depend ##able method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form . [SEP]
[CLS] the invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the bronze age of the late 4th millennium bc . [SEP]
[CLS] the sum ##erian archaic cu ##ne ##iform script and the egyptian hi ##ero ##gly ##phs are generally considered the earliest writing systems , both emerging out of their ancestral proto - liter ##ate symbol systems from 340 ##0 to 320 ##0 bc with earliest coherent texts from about 260 ##0 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] it is generally agreed that sum ##erian writing was an independent invention ; however , it is debated whether egyptian writing was developed completely independently of sum ##erian , or was a case of cultural diffusion . [SEP]
[CLS] archaeologist denise sc ##hman ##dt - be ##sser ##at determined the link between previously un ##cate ##gor ##ized clay " token ##s " , the oldest of which have been found in the za ##gr ##os region of iran , and the first known writing , mesopotamia ##n cu ##ne ##iform . [SEP]
[CLS] in approximately 800 ##0 bc , the mesopotamia ##ns began using clay token ##s to count their agricultural and manufactured goods . [SEP]
[CLS] later they began placing these token ##s inside large , hollow clay containers ( bull ##a , or g ##lo ##bular envelope ##s ) which were then sealed . [SEP]
[CLS] the quantity of token ##s in each container came to be expressed by impress ##ing , on the container ' s surface , one picture for each instance of the token inside . [SEP]
[CLS] they next di ##sp ##ense ##d with the token ##s , relying solely on symbols for the token ##s , drawn on clay surfaces . [SEP]
[CLS] to avoid making a picture for each instance of the same object ( for example : 100 pictures of a hat to represent 100 hats ) , they ' counted ' the objects by using various small marks . [SEP]
[CLS] in this way the sum ##erian ##s added " a system for en ##ume ##rating objects to their inc ##ip ##ient system of symbols " . [SEP]
[CLS] the original mesopotamia ##n writing system was derived around 320 ##0 bc from this method of keeping accounts . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of the 4th millennium bc , the mesopotamia ##ns were using a triangular - shaped st ##ylus pressed into soft clay to record numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] this system was gradually augmented with using a sharp st ##ylus to indicate what was being counted by means of pic ##to ##graphs . [SEP]
[CLS] round - st ##ylus and sharp - st ##ylus writing was gradually replaced by writing using a wedge - shaped st ##ylus ( hence the term cu ##ne ##iform ) , at first only for logo ##gram ##s , but by the 29th century bc also for phonetic elements . [SEP]
[CLS] around 270 ##0 bc , cu ##ne ##iform began to represent syllables of spoken sum ##erian . [SEP]
[CLS] about that time , mesopotamia ##n cu ##ne ##iform became a general purpose writing system for logo ##gram ##s , syllables , and numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] this script was adapted to another mesopotamia ##n language , the east semitic ak ##ka ##dian ( assyrian and babylonian ) around 260 ##0 bc , and then to others such as el ##ami ##te , hat ##tian , hu ##rri ##an and hit ##tite . [SEP]
[CLS] scripts similar in appearance to this writing system include those for u ##gar ##itic and old persian . [SEP]
[CLS] with the adoption of aramaic as the ' ling ##ua fran ##ca ' of the neo - assyrian empire ( 911 – 60 ##9 bc ) , old aramaic was also adapted to mesopotamia ##n cu ##ne ##iform . [SEP]
[CLS] the last cu ##ne ##iform scripts in ak ##ka ##dian discovered thus far date from the 1st century ad . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest known hi ##ero ##gly ##phic date back to the second half of the 4th millennium bc , such as the clay labels of a pre ##dy ##nas ##tic ruler called " scorpion i " ( na ##qa ##da iii ##a period , c . 32nd century bc ) recovered at ab ##yd ##os ( modern umm el - q ##a ' ab ) in 1998 or the na ##rm ##er palette , dating to c . 310 ##0 bc , and several recent discoveries that may be slightly older , though these g ##ly ##phs were based on a much older artistic rather than written tradition . [SEP]
[CLS] the hi ##ero ##gly ##phic script was logo ##graphic with phonetic adjunct ##s that included an effective alphabet . [SEP]
[CLS] the world ' s oldest dec ##ip ##hered sentence was found on a seal impression found in the tomb of seth - per ##ib ##sen at umm el - q ##a ' ab , which dates from the second dynasty ( 28th or 27th century bc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there are around 800 hi ##ero ##gly ##phs dating back to the old kingdom , middle kingdom and new kingdom eras . [SEP]
[CLS] by the greco - roman period , there are more than 5 , 000 . [SEP]
[CLS] writing was very important in maintaining the egyptian empire , and literacy was concentrated among an educated elite of scribe ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] only people from certain backgrounds were allowed to train to become scribe ##s , in the service of temple , ph ##ara ##onic , and military authorities . [SEP]
[CLS] the hi ##ero ##gly ##ph system was always difficult to learn , but in later centuries was purposely made even more so , as this preserved the scribe ##s ' status . [SEP]
[CLS] the world ' s oldest known alphabet appears to have been developed by can ##aan ##ite turquoise miners in the sinai desert around the mid - 19th century bc . [SEP]
[CLS] around 30 crude inscriptions have been found at a mountainous egyptian mining site known as sera ##bit el - k ##had ##em . [SEP]
[CLS] this site was also home to a temple of hat ##hor , the " mistress of turquoise " . [SEP]
[CLS] a later , two line inscription has also been found at wadi el - ho ##l in central egypt . [SEP]
[CLS] based on hi ##ero ##gly ##phic prototypes , but also including entirely new symbols , each sign apparently stood for a consonant rather than a word : the basis of an alphabet ##ic system . [SEP]
[CLS] it was not until the 12th to 9th centuries , however , that the alphabet took hold and became widely used . [SEP]
[CLS] over the centuries , three distinct el ##ami ##te scripts developed . [SEP]
[CLS] proto - el ##ami ##te is the oldest known writing system from iran . [SEP]
[CLS] in use only for a brief time ( c . 320 ##0 – 290 ##0 bc ) , clay tablets with proto - el ##ami ##te writing have been found at different sites across iran . [SEP]
[CLS] the proto - el ##ami ##te script is thought to have developed from early cu ##ne ##iform ( proto - cu ##ne ##iform ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the proto - el ##ami ##te script consists of more than 1 , 000 signs and is thought to be partly logo ##graphic . [SEP]
[CLS] linear el ##ami ##te is a writing system attested in a few monumental inscriptions in iran . [SEP]
[CLS] it was used for a very brief period during the last quarter of the 3rd millennium bc . [SEP]
[CLS] it is often claimed that linear el ##ami ##te is a sy ##lla ##bic writing system derived from proto - el ##ami ##te , although this cannot be proven since linear - el ##ami ##te has not been dec ##ip ##hered . [SEP]
[CLS] several scholars have attempted to dec ##ip ##her the script , most notably and . [SEP]
[CLS] the el ##ami ##te cu ##ne ##iform script was used from about 2500 to 331 bc , and was adapted from the ak ##ka ##dian cu ##ne ##iform . [SEP]
[CLS] the el ##ami ##te cu ##ne ##iform script consisted of about 130 symbols , far fewer than most other cu ##ne ##iform scripts . [SEP]
[CLS] cr ##eta ##n hi ##ero ##gly ##phs are found on artifacts of crete ( early - to - mid - 2nd millennium bc , mm i to mm iii , overlapping with linear a from mm ii ##a at the earliest ) . [SEP]
[CLS] linear b , the writing system of the my ##cen ##aea ##n greeks , has been dec ##ip ##hered while linear a has yet to be dec ##ip ##hered . [SEP]
[CLS] the sequence and the geographical spread of the three overlapping , but distinct writing systems can be summarized as follows : cr ##eta ##n hi ##ero ##gly ##phs were used in crete from c . 1625 to 1500 bc ; linear a was used in the aegean islands ( ke ##a , ky ##ther ##a , mel ##os , the ##ra ) , and the greek mainland ( lac ##onia ) from c . 18th century to 145 ##0 bc ; and linear b was used in crete ( kn ##oss ##os ) , and mainland ( p ##yl ##os , my ##cen ##ae , the ##bes , ti ##ryn ##s ) from c . 137 ##5 to 1200 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest surviving examples of writing in china — inscriptions on so - called " oracle bones " , tor ##to ##ise pl ##ast ##rons and ox sc ##ap ##ula ##e used for di ##vina ##tion — date from around 1200 bc in the late shang dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] a small number of bronze inscriptions from the same period have also survived . [SEP]
[CLS] historians have found that the type of media used had an effect on what the writing was documenting and how it was used . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2003 , archaeologists reported discoveries of isolated tor ##to ##ise - shell carvings dating back to the 7th millennium bc , but whether or not these symbols are related to the characters of the later oracle - bone script is disputed . [SEP]
[CLS] indus script refers to short strings of symbols associated with the indus valley civilization ( which spanned modern - day pakistan and north india ) used between 260 ##0 and 1900 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] in spite of many attempts at dec ##ip ##her ##ments and claims , it is as yet und ##ec ##ip ##hered . [SEP]
[CLS] the term ' indus script ' is mainly applied to that used in the mature hara ##ppa ##n phase , which perhaps evolved from a few signs found in early hara ##ppa after 350 ##0 bc , and was followed by the mature hara ##ppa ##n script . [SEP]
[CLS] the script is written from right to left , and sometimes follows a bo ##ust ##rop ##hed ##onic style . [SEP]
[CLS] since the number of principal signs is about 400 – 600 , midway between typical logo ##graphic and sy ##lla ##bic scripts , many scholars accept the script to be logo - sy ##lla ##bic ( typically sy ##lla ##bic scripts have about 50 – 100 signs whereas logo ##graphic scripts have a very large number of principal signs ) . [SEP]
[CLS] several scholars maintain that structural analysis indicates that an ag ##gl ##uti ##nat ##ive language under ##lies the script . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2001 , archaeologists discovered that there was a civilization in central asia that used writing c . 2000 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] an excavation near ash ##ga ##bat , the capital of turkmenistan , revealed an inscription on a piece of stone that was used as a stamp seal . [SEP]
[CLS] the proto - sinai ##tic script , in which proto - can ##aan ##ite is believed to have been first written , is attested as far back as the 19th century bc . [SEP]
[CLS] the ph ##oe ##nic ##ian writing system was adapted from the proto - can ##aan ##ite script sometime before the 14th century bc , which in turn borrowed principles of representing phonetic information from egyptian hi ##ero ##gly ##phs . [SEP]
[CLS] this writing system was an odd sort of sy ##lla ##bar ##y in which only consonants are represented . [SEP]
[CLS] this script was adapted by the greeks , who adapted certain consonant ##al signs to represent their vowels . [SEP]
[CLS] the cum ##ae alphabet , a variant of the early greek alphabet , gave rise to the et ##rus ##can alphabet and its own descendants , such as the latin alphabet and runes . [SEP]
[CLS] other descendants from the greek alphabet include cyrillic , used to write bulgarian , russian and serbian , among others . [SEP]
[CLS] the ph ##oe ##nic ##ian system was also adapted into the aramaic script , from which the hebrew and the arabic scripts are descended . [SEP]
[CLS] the ti ##fin ##agh script ( berber languages ) is descended from the li ##by ##co - berber script , which is assumed to be of ph ##oe ##nic ##ian origin . [SEP]
[CLS] a stone slab with 3 , 000 - year - old writing , known as the cas ##ca ##jal block , was discovered in the mexican state of veracruz and is an example of the oldest script in the western hemisphere , preceding the oldest za ##pot ##ec writing by approximately 500 years . [SEP]
[CLS] it is thought to be ol ##me ##c . [SEP]
[CLS] of several pre - columbian scripts in me ##so ##ame ##rica , the one that appears to have been best developed , and the only one to be dec ##ip ##hered , is the maya script . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest inscription identified as maya dates to the 3rd century bc . [SEP]
[CLS] maya writing used logo ##gram ##s complement ##ed by a set of sy ##lla ##bic g ##ly ##phs , somewhat similar in function to modern japanese writing . [SEP]
[CLS] the inca ##s had no known script . [SEP]
[CLS] their qui ##pu system of recording information — based on knots tied along one or many linked cords — was apparently used for inventory and account ##ancy purposes and could not en ##code textual information . [SEP]
[CLS] three stone slabs were found by romanian archaeologist nicola ##e v ##lass ##a , in the mid - 20th century ( 1961 ) in tar ##tar ##ia ( present - day alba county , transylvania ) , romania , ancient land of da ##cia , inhabited by da ##cian ##s , which were a population who may have been related to the get ##ae ##s and th ##rac ##ians . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the slabs contains 4 groups of pic ##to ##graphs divided by lines . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the characters are also found in ancient greek , as well as in ph ##oe ##nic ##ian , et ##rus ##can , old it ##alic and iberian . [SEP]
[CLS] the origin and the timing of the writings are disputed , because there are no precise evidence in situ , the slabs cannot be carbon dated , because of the bad treatment of the cl ##uj museum . [SEP]
[CLS] there are indirect carbon dates found on a skeleton discovered near the slabs , that ce ##rti ##fies the 530 ##0 – 550 ##0 bc period . [SEP]
[CLS] in many parts of the world , writing has become an even more important part of daily life as digital technologies have helped connect individuals from across the globe through systems such as e - mail and social media . [SEP]
[CLS] such technologies have brought substantial amounts of routine reading and writing into most modern workplace ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , for example , the ability to read and write is necessary for most jobs , and multiple programs are in place to aid both children and adults in improving their literacy skills . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the emergence of the writing center and community - wide literacy councils aim to help students and community members sharpe ##n their writing skills . [SEP]
[CLS] these resources , and many more , span across different age groups in order to offer each individual a better understanding of their language and how to express themselves via writing in order to perhaps improve their socio ##economic status . [SEP]
[CLS] other parts of the world have seen an increase in writing abilities as a result of programs such as the world literacy foundation and international literacy foundation , as well as a general push for increased global communication . [SEP]
