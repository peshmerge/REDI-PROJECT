[CLS] spec ##iation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species . [SEP]
[CLS] the biologist or ##ator f . cook coined the term in 1906 for clad ##ogen ##esis , the splitting of lineage ##s , as opposed to ana ##genesis , ph ##yle ##tic evolution within lineage ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] charles darwin was the first to describe the role of natural selection in spec ##iation in his 1859 book " on the origin of species " . [SEP]
[CLS] he also identified sexual selection as a likely mechanism , but found it problematic . [SEP]
[CLS] there are four geographic modes of spec ##iation in nature , based on the extent to which spec ##iating populations are isolated from one another : all ##opa ##tric , per ##ip ##at ##ric , para ##pa ##tric , and sy ##mp ##at ##ric . [SEP]
[CLS] spec ##iation may also be induced artificial ##ly , through animal husband ##ry , agriculture , or laboratory experiments . [SEP]
[CLS] whether genetic drift is a minor or major contributor to spec ##iation is the subject matter of much ongoing discussion . [SEP]
[CLS] rapid sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation can take place through poly ##pl ##oid ##y , such as by doubling of chromosome number ; the result is pro ##geny which are immediately reproductive ##ly isolated from the parent population . [SEP]
[CLS] new species can also be created through hybrid ##isation followed , if the hybrid is favoured by natural selection , by reproductive isolation . [SEP]
[CLS] in addressing the question of the origin of species , there are two key issues : ( 1 ) what are the evolutionary mechanisms of spec ##iation , and ( 2 ) what accounts for the separate ##ness and individual ##ity of species in the bio ##ta ? [SEP]
[CLS] since charles darwin ' s time , efforts to understand the nature of species have primarily focused on the first aspect , and it is now widely agreed that the critical factor behind the origin of new species is reproductive isolation . [SEP]
[CLS] next we focus on the second aspect of the origin of species . [SEP]
[CLS] in " on the origin of species " ( 1859 ) , darwin interpreted biological evolution in terms of natural selection , but was per ##plex ##ed by the cluster ##ing of organisms into species . [SEP]
[CLS] chapter 6 of darwin ' s book is entitled " difficulties of the theory . " [SEP]
[CLS] in discussing these " difficulties " he noted " firstly , why , if species have descended from other species by ins ##ens ##ibly fine gr ##ada ##tions , do we not everywhere see inn ##ume ##rable transitional forms ? [SEP]
[CLS] why is not all nature in confusion instead of the species being , as we see them , well defined ? " [SEP]
[CLS] this dilemma can be referred to as the absence or ra ##rity of transitional varieties in habitat space . [SEP]
[CLS] another dilemma , related to the first one , is the absence or ra ##rity of transitional varieties in time . [SEP]
[CLS] darwin pointed out that by the theory of natural selection " inn ##ume ##rable transitional forms must have existed , " and wondered " why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth . " [SEP]
[CLS] that clearly defined species actually do exist in nature in both space and time implies that some fundamental feature of natural selection operates to generate and maintain species . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been argued that the resolution of darwin ' s first dilemma lies in the fact that out - crossing sexual reproduction has an intrinsic cost of ra ##rity . [SEP]
[CLS] the cost of ra ##rity arises as follows . [SEP]
[CLS] if , on a resource gradient , a large number of separate species evolve , each exquisite ##ly adapted to a very narrow band on that gradient , each species will , of necessity , consist of very few members . [SEP]
[CLS] finding a mate under these circumstances may present difficulties when many of the individuals in the neighborhood belong to other species . [SEP]
[CLS] under these circumstances , if any species ’ population size happens , by chance , to increase ( at the expense of one or other of its neighboring species , if the environment is saturated ) , this will immediately make it easier for its members to find sexual partners . [SEP]
[CLS] the members of the neighboring species , whose population sizes have decreased , experience greater difficulty in finding mates , and therefore form pairs less frequently than the larger species . [SEP]
[CLS] this has a snow ##ball effect , with large species growing at the expense of the smaller , rare ##r species , eventually driving them to extinction . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , only a few species remain , each distinctly different from the other . [SEP]
[CLS] the cost of ra ##rity not only involves the costs of failure to find a mate , but also indirect costs such as the cost of communication in seeking out a partner at low population den ##sities . [SEP]
[CLS] ra ##rity brings with it other costs . [SEP]
[CLS] rare and unusual features are very seldom advantage ##ous . [SEP]
[CLS] in most instances , they indicate a ( non - silent ) mutation , which is almost certain to be del ##eter ##ious . [SEP]
[CLS] it therefore be ##ho ##ove ##s sexual creatures to avoid mates sporting rare or unusual features ( ko ##ino ##phi ##lia ) . [SEP]
[CLS] sexual populations therefore rapidly shed rare or peripheral ph ##eno ##typic features , thus canal ##izing the entire external appearance , as illustrated in the accompanying illustration of the african p ##y ##gm ##y king ##fish ##er , " is ##pid ##ina pic ##ta " . [SEP]
[CLS] this uniform ##ity of all the adult members of a sexual species has stimulated the proliferation of field guides on birds , mammals , reptiles , insects , and many other taxa , in which a species can be described with a single illustration ( or two , in the case of sexual dim ##or ##phi ##sm ) . [SEP]
[CLS] once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species ( and is illustrated in the photograph of the african p ##y ##gm ##y king ##fish ##er ) , its members will avoid mating with members of other populations that look different from themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the avoidance of mates displaying rare and unusual ph ##eno ##typic features inevitably leads to reproductive isolation , one of the hallmark ##s of spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] in the contrasting case of organisms that reproduce as ##ex ##ually , there is no cost of ra ##rity ; consequently , there are only benefits to fine - scale adaptation . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , as ##ex ##ual organisms very frequently show the continuous variation in form ( often in many different directions ) that darwin expected evolution to produce , making their classification into " species " ( more correctly , mor ##ph ##os ##pe ##cies ) very difficult . [SEP]
[CLS] all forms of natural spec ##iation have taken place over the course of evolution ; however , debate persist ##s as to the relative importance of each mechanism in driving biodiversity . [SEP]
[CLS] one example of natural spec ##iation is the diversity of the three - spine ##d stick ##le ##back , a marine fish that , after the last glacial period , has undergone spec ##iation into new freshwater colonies in isolated lakes and streams . [SEP]
[CLS] over an estimated 10 , 000 generations , the stick ##le ##backs show structural differences that are greater than those seen between different genera of fish including variations in fins , changes in the number or size of their bony plates , variable jaw structure , and color differences . [SEP]
[CLS] during all ##opa ##tric ( from the ancient greek " all ##os " , " other " + " pat ##ra " , " father ##land " ) spec ##iation , a population splits into two geographically isolated populations ( for example , by habitat fragmentation due to geographical change such as mountain formation ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the isolated populations then undergo gen ##ot ##yp ##ic or ph ##eno ##typic diver ##gence as : ( a ) they become subjected to di ##ssi ##mi ##lar selective pressures ; ( b ) they independently undergo genetic drift ; ( c ) different mutations arise in the two populations . [SEP]
[CLS] when the populations come back into contact , they have evolved such that they are reproductive ##ly isolated and are no longer capable of exchanging genes . [SEP]
[CLS] island genetics is the term associated with the tendency of small , isolated genetic pools to produce unusual traits . [SEP]
[CLS] examples include ins ##ular dwarf ##ism and the radical changes among certain famous island chains , for example on ko ##mo ##do . [SEP]
[CLS] the gala ##pa ##gos islands are particularly famous for their influence on charles darwin . [SEP]
[CLS] during his five weeks there he heard that gala ##pa ##gos tor ##to ##ises could be identified by island , and noticed that finch ##es differed from one island to another , but it was only nine months later that he reflected that such facts could show that species were change ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] when he returned to england , his speculation on evolution deepened after experts informed him that these were separate species , not just varieties , and famously that other differing gala ##pa ##gos birds were all species of finch ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] though the finch ##es were less important for darwin , more recent research has shown the birds now known as darwin ' s finch ##es to be a classic case of adaptive evolutionary radiation . [SEP]
[CLS] in per ##ip ##at ##ric spec ##iation , a sub ##form of all ##opa ##tric spec ##iation , new species are formed in isolated , smaller peripheral populations that are prevented from exchanging genes with the main population . [SEP]
[CLS] it is related to the concept of a founder effect , since small populations often undergo bottle ##neck ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] genetic drift is often proposed to play a significant role in per ##ip ##at ##ric spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] case studies include may ##r ' s investigation of bird fauna ; the australian bird " pet ##roi ##ca multi ##color " ; and reproductive isolation in populations of " dr ##oso ##phila " subject to population bottle ##neck ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] in para ##pa ##tric spec ##iation , there is only partial separation of the zones of two diver ##ging populations afforded by geography ; individuals of each species may come in contact or cross habitats from time to time , but reduced fitness of the het ##ero ##zy ##go ##te leads to selection for behaviour ##s or mechanisms that prevent their inter ##bre ##eding . [SEP]
[CLS] para ##pa ##tric spec ##iation is modelled on continuous variation within a " single , " connected habitat acting as a source of natural selection rather than the effects of isolation of habitats produced in per ##ip ##at ##ric and all ##opa ##tric spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] para ##pa ##tric spec ##iation may be associated with differential landscape - dependent selection . [SEP]
[CLS] even if there is a gene flow between two populations , strong differential selection may imp ##ede assimilation and different species may eventually develop . [SEP]
[CLS] habitat differences may be more important in the development of reproductive isolation than the isolation time . [SEP]
[CLS] caucasian rock lizards " dare ##vs ##kia ru ##dis " , " d . valentin ##i " and " d . ports ##chin ##ski ##i " all hybrid ##ize with each other in their hybrid zone ; however , hybrid ##ization is stronger between " d . ports ##chin ##ski ##i " and " d . ru ##dis " , which separated earlier but live in similar habitats than between " d . valentin ##i " and two other species , which separated later but live in climatic ##ally different habitats . [SEP]
[CLS] eco ##logists refer to para ##pa ##tric and per ##ip ##at ##ric spec ##iation in terms of ecological niche ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] a niche must be available in order for a new species to be successful . [SEP]
[CLS] ring species such as " la ##rus " gu ##lls have been claimed to illustrate spec ##iation in progress , though the situation may be more complex . [SEP]
[CLS] the grass " ant ##ho ##xa ##nt ##hum odor ##at ##um " may be starting para ##pa ##tric spec ##iation in areas of mine contamination . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation is the formation of two or more descendant species from a single ancestral species all occupying the same geographic location . [SEP]
[CLS] often - cited examples of sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation are found in insects that become dependent on different host plants in the same area . [SEP]
[CLS] the best known example of sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation is that of the ci ##ch ##lid ##s of east africa inhabit ##ing the rift valley lakes , particularly lake victoria , lake malawi and lake tang ##any ##ika . [SEP]
[CLS] there are over 800 described species , and according to estimates , there could be well over 1 , 600 species in the region . [SEP]
[CLS] their evolution is cited as an example of both natural and sexual selection . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2008 study suggests that sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation has occurred in tennessee cave sal ##aman ##ders . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation driven by ecological factors may also account for the extraordinary diversity of crust ##ace ##ans living in the depths of siberia ' s lake bai ##kal . [SEP]
[CLS] bud ##ding spec ##iation has been proposed as a particular form of sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation , whereby small groups of individuals become progressively more isolated from the ancestral stock by breeding prefer ##ential ##ly with one another . [SEP]
[CLS] this type of spec ##iation would be driven by the conjunction of various advantages of in ##bre ##eding such as the expression of advantage ##ous recess ##ive ph ##eno ##type ##s , reducing the rec ##om ##bina ##tion load , and reducing the cost of sex [SEP]
[CLS] the hawthorn fly ( " r ##ha ##gol ##eti ##s po ##mon ##ella " ) , also known as the apple mag ##go ##t fly , appears to be undergoing sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] different populations of hawthorn fly feed on different fruits . [SEP]
[CLS] a distinct population emerged in north america in the 19th century some time after apples , a non - native species , were introduced . [SEP]
[CLS] this apple - feeding population normally feeds only on apples and not on the historically preferred fruit of hawthorn ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the current hawthorn feeding population does not normally feed on apples . [SEP]
[CLS] some evidence , such as that six out of thirteen all ##oz ##yme lo ##ci are different , that hawthorn flies mature later in the season and take longer to mature than apple flies ; and that there is little evidence of inter ##bre ##eding ( researchers have documented a 4 - 6 % hybrid ##ization rate ) suggests that sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation is occurring . [SEP]
[CLS] reinforcement , sometimes referred to as the wallace effect , is the process by which natural selection increases reproductive isolation . [SEP]
[CLS] it may occur after two populations of the same species are separated and then come back into contact . [SEP]
[CLS] if their reproductive isolation was complete , then they will have already developed into two separate incompatible species . [SEP]
[CLS] if their reproductive isolation is incomplete , then further mating between the populations will produce hybrids , which may or may not be fertile . [SEP]
[CLS] if the hybrids are in ##fer ##tile , or fertile but less fit than their ancestors , then there will be further reproductive isolation and spec ##iation has essentially occurred ( e . g . , as in horses and donkey ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the reasoning behind this is that if the parents of the hybrid offspring each have naturally selected traits for their own certain environments , the hybrid offspring will bear traits from both , therefore would not fit either ecological niche as well as either parent . [SEP]
[CLS] the low fitness of the hybrids would cause selection to favor ass ##ort ##ative mating , which would control hybrid ##ization . [SEP]
[CLS] this is sometimes called the wallace effect after the evolutionary biologist alfred russ ##el wallace who suggested in the late 19th century that it might be an important factor in spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] conversely , if the hybrid offspring are more fit than their ancestors , then the populations will merge back into the same species within the area they are in contact . [SEP]
[CLS] reinforcement favor ##ing reproductive isolation is required for both para ##pa ##tric and sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] without reinforcement , the geographic area of contact between different forms of the same species , called their " hybrid zone , " will not develop into a boundary between the different species . [SEP]
[CLS] hybrid zones are regions where diver ##ged populations meet and inter ##bre ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] hybrid offspring are very common in these regions , which are usually created by diver ##ged species coming into secondary contact . [SEP]
[CLS] without reinforcement , the two species would have un ##con ##tro ##lla ##ble in ##bre ##eding . [SEP]
[CLS] reinforcement may be induced in artificial selection experiments as described below . [SEP]
[CLS] ecological selection is " the interaction of individuals with their environment during resource acquisition " . [SEP]
[CLS] natural selection is inherently involved in the process of spec ##iation , whereby , " under ecological spec ##iation , populations in different environments , or populations exploit ##ing different resources , experience contrasting natural selection pressures on the traits that directly or indirectly bring about the evolution of reproductive isolation " . [SEP]
[CLS] evidence for the role ecology plays in the process of spec ##iation exists . [SEP]
[CLS] studies of stick ##le ##back populations support ecological ##ly - linked spec ##iation arising as a by - product , alongside numerous studies of parallel spec ##iation , where isolation evolve ##s between independent populations of species adapting to contrasting environments than between independent populations adapting to similar environments . [SEP]
[CLS] ecological spec ##iation occurs with much of the evidence , " . . . accumulated from top - down studies of adaptation and reproductive isolation " . [SEP]
[CLS] it is widely appreciated that sexual selection could drive spec ##iation in many clade ##s , independently of natural selection . [SEP]
[CLS] however the term “ spec ##iation ” , in this context , tends to be used in two different , but not mutually exclusive senses . [SEP]
[CLS] the first and most commonly used sense refers to the “ birth ” of new species . [SEP]
[CLS] that is , the splitting of an existing species into two separate species , or the bud ##ding off of a new species from a parent species , both driven by a biological " fashion fa ##d " ( a preference for a feature , or features , in one or both sexes , that do not necessarily have any adaptive qualities ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the second sense , " spec ##iation " refers to the wide - spread tendency of sexual creatures to be grouped into clearly defined species , rather than forming a continuum of ph ##eno ##type ##s both in time and space - which would be the more obvious or logical consequence of natural selection . [SEP]
[CLS] this was indeed recognized by darwin as problematic , and included in his " on the origin of species " ( 1859 ) , under the heading " difficulties with the theory " . [SEP]
[CLS] there are several suggestions as to how mate choice might play a significant role in resolving . [SEP]
[CLS] new species have been created by animal husband ##ry , but the dates and methods of the initiation of such species are not clear . [SEP]
[CLS] often , the domestic counterpart of the wild ancestor can still inter ##bre ##ed and produce fertile offspring as in the case of domestic cattle , that can be considered the same species as several varieties of wild ox , ga ##ur , ya ##k , etc . , or domestic sheep that can inter ##bre ##ed with the mo ##uf ##lon . [SEP]
[CLS] the best - documented creations of new species in the laboratory were performed in the late 1980s . [SEP]
[CLS] william r . rice and george w . salt bred " dr ##oso ##phila mel ##ano ##gas ##ter " fruit flies using a maze with three different choices of habitat such as light / dark and wet / dry . [SEP]
[CLS] each generation was placed into the maze , and the groups of flies that came out of two of the eight exits were set apart to breed with each other in their respective groups . [SEP]
[CLS] after thirty - five generations , the two groups and their offspring were isolated reproductive ##ly because of their strong habitat preferences : they mated only within the areas they preferred , and so did not mate with flies that preferred the other areas . [SEP]
[CLS] the history of such attempts is described by rice and el ##en e . host ##ert ( 1993 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] diane dodd used a laboratory experiment to show how reproductive isolation can develop in " dr ##oso ##phila pseudo ##ob ##scu ##ra " fruit flies after several generations by placing them in different media , star ##ch - and mal ##tose - based media . [SEP]
[CLS] dodd ' s experiment has been easy for many others to replicate , including with other kinds of fruit flies and foods . [SEP]
[CLS] research in 2005 has shown that this rapid evolution of reproductive isolation may in fact be a relic of infection by " wo ##lb ##achi ##a " bacteria . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatively , these observations are consistent with the notion that sexual creatures are inherently reluctant to mate with individuals whose appearance or behavior is different from the norm . [SEP]
[CLS] the risk that such deviation ##s are due to her ##ita ##ble mala ##da ##pta ##tions is very high . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , if a sexual creature , unable to predict natural selection ' s future direction , is conditioned to produce the fit ##test offspring possible , it will avoid mates with unusual habits or features . [SEP]
[CLS] sexual creatures will then inevitably tend to group themselves into reproductive ##ly isolated species . [SEP]
[CLS] few spec ##iation genes have been found . [SEP]
[CLS] they usually involve the reinforcement process of late stages of spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2008 , a spec ##iation gene causing reproductive isolation was reported . [SEP]
[CLS] it causes hybrid ste ##ril ##ity between related subspecies . [SEP]
[CLS] the order of spec ##iation of three groups from a common ancestor may be unclear or unknown ; a collection of three such species is referred to as a " tri ##cho ##tom ##y . " [SEP]
[CLS] poly ##pl ##oid ##y is a mechanism that has caused many rapid spec ##iation events in sy ##mp ##at ##ry because offspring of , for example , te ##tra ##pl ##oid x dip ##loid mating ##s often result in trip ##loid sterile pro ##geny . [SEP]
[CLS] however , not all poly ##pl ##oids are reproductive ##ly isolated from their parental plants , and gene flow may still occur for example through trip ##loid hybrid x dip ##loid mating ##s that produce te ##tra ##pl ##oids , or mating ##s between mei ##otic ##ally un ##red ##uce ##d game ##tes from dip ##loid ##s and game ##tes from te ##tra ##pl ##oids ( see also hybrid spec ##iation ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been suggested that many of the existing plant and most animal species have undergone an event of poly ##pl ##oid ##ization in their evolutionary history . [SEP]
[CLS] reproduction of successful poly ##pl ##oid species is sometimes as ##ex ##ual , by part ##hen ##ogen ##esis or ap ##omi ##xi ##s , as for unknown reasons many as ##ex ##ual organisms are poly ##pl ##oid . [SEP]
[CLS] rare instances of poly ##pl ##oid mammals are known , but most often result in pre ##nat ##al death . [SEP]
[CLS] hybrid ##ization between two different species sometimes leads to a distinct ph ##eno ##type . [SEP]
[CLS] this ph ##eno ##type can also be fit ##ter than the parental lineage and as such natural selection may then favor these individuals . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , if reproductive isolation is achieved , it may lead to a separate species . [SEP]
[CLS] however , reproductive isolation between hybrids and their parents is particularly difficult to achieve and thus hybrid spec ##iation is considered an extremely rare event . [SEP]
[CLS] the mariana mall ##ard is thought to have arise ##n from hybrid spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] hybrid ##ization is an important means of spec ##iation in plants , since poly ##pl ##oid ##y ( having more than two copies of each chromosome ) is tolerated in plants more readily than in animals . [SEP]
[CLS] poly ##pl ##oid ##y is important in hybrids as it allows reproduction , with the two different sets of chromosomes each being able to pair with an identical partner during mei ##osis . [SEP]
[CLS] poly ##pl ##oids also have more genetic diversity , which allows them to avoid in ##bre ##eding depression in small populations . [SEP]
[CLS] hybrid ##ization without change in chromosome number is called homo ##pl ##oid hybrid spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] it is considered very rare but has been shown in " he ##lic ##oni ##us " butterflies and sun ##flower ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] poly ##pl ##oid spec ##iation , which involves changes in chromosome number , is a more common phenomenon , especially in plant species . [SEP]
[CLS] theo ##dos ##ius do ##b ##zh ##ans ##ky , who studied fruit flies in the early days of genetic research in 1930s , speculated that parts of chromosomes that switch from one location to another might cause a species to split into two different species . [SEP]
[CLS] he mapped out how it might be possible for sections of chromosomes to relocate themselves in a genome . [SEP]
[CLS] those mobile sections can cause ste ##ril ##ity in inter - species hybrids , which can act as a spec ##iation pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] in theory , his idea was sound , but scientists long debated whether it actually happened in nature . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually a competing theory involving the gradual accumulation of mutations was shown to occur in nature so often that genetic ##ists largely dismissed the moving gene hypothesis . [SEP]
[CLS] however , 2006 research shows that jumping of a gene from one chromosome to another can contribute to the birth of new species . [SEP]
[CLS] this valid ##ates the reproductive isolation mechanism , a key component of spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] there is debate as to the rate at which spec ##iation events occur over geologic time . [SEP]
[CLS] while some evolutionary biologist ##s claim that spec ##iation events have remained relatively constant and gradual over time ( known as " ph ##yle ##tic gradual ##ism " - see diagram ) , some pal ##ae ##ont ##ologists such as nile ##s el ##dre ##dge and stephen jay gould have argued that species usually remain unchanged over long stretches of time , and that spec ##iation occurs only over relatively brief intervals , a view known as " pun ##ctuated equilibrium " . [SEP]
[CLS] ( see diagram , and . ) [SEP]
[CLS] evolution can be extremely rapid , as shown in the creation of domestic ##ated animals and plants in a very short geological space of time , spanning only a few tens of thousands of years . [SEP]
[CLS] maize ( " ze ##a may ##s " ) , for instance , was created in mexico in only a few thousand years , starting about 7 , 000 to 12 , 000 years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] this raises the question of why the long term rate of evolution is far slower than is theoretically possible . [SEP]
[CLS] evolution is imposed on species or groups . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not planned or strive ##n for in some lamar ##cki ##st way . [SEP]
[CLS] the mutations on which the process depends are random events , and , except for the " silent mutations " which do not affect the functionality or appearance of the carrier , are thus usually disadvantage ##ous , and their chance of proving to be useful in the future is vanishing ##ly small . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , while a species or group might benefit from being able to adapt to a new environment by acc ##um ##ulating a wide range of genetic variation , this is to the det ##rim ##ent of the " individuals " who have to carry these mutations until a small , unpredictable minority of them ultimately contributes to such an adaptation . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the " capability " to evolve would require group selection , a concept disc ##red ##ited by ( for example ) george c . williams , john maynard smith and richard da ##wk ##ins as selective ##ly disadvantage ##ous to the individual . [SEP]
[CLS] if sexual individuals are disadvantaged by passing mutations on to their offspring , they will avoid mutant mates with strange or unusual characteristics . [SEP]
[CLS] mutations that affect the external appearance of their carriers will then rarely be passed on to the next and subsequent generations . [SEP]
[CLS] they would therefore seldom be tested by natural selection . [SEP]
[CLS] evolution is , therefore , effectively halted or slowed down considerably . [SEP]
[CLS] the only mutations that can accumulate in a population , on this pun ##ctuated equilibrium view , are ones that have no noticeable effect on the outward appearance and functionality of their bearer ##s ( i . e . , they are " silent " or " neutral mutations , " which can be , and are , used to trace the related ##ness and age of populations and species . ) [SEP]
[CLS] this argument implies that evolution can only occur if mutant mates cannot be avoided , as a result of a severe scar ##city of potential mates . [SEP]
[CLS] this is most likely to occur in small , isolated communities . [SEP]
[CLS] these occur most commonly on small islands , in remote valleys , lakes , river systems , or caves , or during the aftermath of a mass extinction . [SEP]
[CLS] under these circumstances , not only is the choice of mates severely restricted but population bottle ##neck ##s , founder effects , genetic drift and in ##bre ##eding cause rapid , random changes in the isolated population ' s genetic composition . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , hybrid ##ization with a related species trapped in the same isolate might introduce additional genetic changes . [SEP]
[CLS] if an isolated population such as this survives its genetic up ##hea ##val ##s , and subsequently expands into an uno ##cc ##up ##ied niche , or into a niche in which it has an advantage over its competitors , a new species , or subspecies , will have come in being . [SEP]
[CLS] in geological terms , this will be an abrupt event . [SEP]
[CLS] a res ##ump ##tion of avoiding mutant mates will thereafter result , once again , in evolutionary st ##ag ##nation . [SEP]
[CLS] in apparent confirmation of this pun ##ctuated equilibrium view of evolution , the fossil record of an evolutionary progression typically consists of species that suddenly appear , and ultimately disappear , hundreds of thousands or millions of years later , without any change in external appearance . [SEP]
[CLS] graphical ##ly , these fossil species are represented by lines parallel with the time axis , whose lengths depict how long each of them existed . [SEP]
[CLS] the fact that the lines remain parallel with the time axis illustrates the un ##chang ##ing appearance of each of the fossil species depicted on the graph . [SEP]
[CLS] during each species ' existence new species appear at random intervals , each also lasting many hundreds of thousands of years before disappearing without a change in appearance . [SEP]
[CLS] the exact related ##ness of these concurrent species is generally impossible to determine . [SEP]
[CLS] this is illustrated in the diagram depicting the distribution of ho ##mini ##n species through time since the ho ##mini ##ns separated from the line that led to the evolution of our closest living primate relatives , the chi ##mp ##an ##zee ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] for similar evolutionary time lines see , for instance , the pale ##ont ##ological list of african dinosaurs , asian dinosaurs , the lamp ##ri ##form ##es and ami ##iform ##es . [SEP]
