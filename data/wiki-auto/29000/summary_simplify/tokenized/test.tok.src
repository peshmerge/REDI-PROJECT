[CLS] the biologist or ##ator f . cook coined the term in 1906 for clad ##ogen ##esis , the splitting of lineage ##s , as opposed to ana ##genesis , ph ##yle ##tic evolution within lineage ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] charles darwin was the first to describe the role of natural selection in spec ##iation in his 1859 book " on the origin of species " . [SEP]
[CLS] there are four geographic modes of spec ##iation in nature , based on the extent to which spec ##iating populations are isolated from one another : all ##opa ##tric , per ##ip ##at ##ric , para ##pa ##tric , and sy ##mp ##at ##ric . [SEP]
[CLS] new species can also be created through hybrid ##isation followed , if the hybrid is favoured by natural selection , by reproductive isolation . [SEP]
[CLS] in addressing the question of the origin of species , there are two key issues : ( 1 ) what are the evolutionary mechanisms of spec ##iation , and ( 2 ) what accounts for the separate ##ness and individual ##ity of species in the bio ##ta ? [SEP]
[CLS] since charles darwin ' s time , efforts to understand the nature of species have primarily focused on the first aspect , and it is now widely agreed that the critical factor behind the origin of new species is reproductive isolation . [SEP]
[CLS] in " on the origin of species " ( 1859 ) , darwin interpreted biological evolution in terms of natural selection , but was per ##plex ##ed by the cluster ##ing of organisms into species . [SEP]
[CLS] in discussing these " difficulties " he noted " firstly , why , if species have descended from other species by ins ##ens ##ibly fine gr ##ada ##tions , do we not everywhere see inn ##ume ##rable transitional forms ? [SEP]
[CLS] this dilemma can be referred to as the absence or ra ##rity of transitional varieties in habitat space . [SEP]
[CLS] darwin pointed out that by the theory of natural selection " inn ##ume ##rable transitional forms must have existed , " and wondered " why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth . " [SEP]
[CLS] that clearly defined species actually do exist in nature in both space and time implies that some fundamental feature of natural selection operates to generate and maintain species . [SEP]
[CLS] if , on a resource gradient , a large number of separate species evolve , each exquisite ##ly adapted to a very narrow band on that gradient , each species will , of necessity , consist of very few members . [SEP]
[CLS] finding a mate under these circumstances may present difficulties when many of the individuals in the neighborhood belong to other species . [SEP]
[CLS] under these circumstances , if any species ’ population size happens , by chance , to increase ( at the expense of one or other of its neighboring species , if the environment is saturated ) , this will immediately make it easier for its members to find sexual partners . [SEP]
[CLS] this has a snow ##ball effect , with large species growing at the expense of the smaller , rare ##r species , eventually driving them to extinction . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , only a few species remain , each distinctly different from the other . [SEP]
[CLS] sexual populations therefore rapidly shed rare or peripheral ph ##eno ##typic features , thus canal ##izing the entire external appearance , as illustrated in the accompanying illustration of the african p ##y ##gm ##y king ##fish ##er , " is ##pid ##ina pic ##ta " . [SEP]
[CLS] this uniform ##ity of all the adult members of a sexual species has stimulated the proliferation of field guides on birds , mammals , reptiles , insects , and many other taxa , in which a species can be described with a single illustration ( or two , in the case of sexual dim ##or ##phi ##sm ) . [SEP]
[CLS] once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species ( and is illustrated in the photograph of the african p ##y ##gm ##y king ##fish ##er ) , its members will avoid mating with members of other populations that look different from themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the avoidance of mates displaying rare and unusual ph ##eno ##typic features inevitably leads to reproductive isolation , one of the hallmark ##s of spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] in the contrasting case of organisms that reproduce as ##ex ##ually , there is no cost of ra ##rity ; consequently , there are only benefits to fine - scale adaptation . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , as ##ex ##ual organisms very frequently show the continuous variation in form ( often in many different directions ) that darwin expected evolution to produce , making their classification into " species " ( more correctly , mor ##ph ##os ##pe ##cies ) very difficult . [SEP]
[CLS] all forms of natural spec ##iation have taken place over the course of evolution ; however , debate persist ##s as to the relative importance of each mechanism in driving biodiversity . [SEP]
[CLS] one example of natural spec ##iation is the diversity of the three - spine ##d stick ##le ##back , a marine fish that , after the last glacial period , has undergone spec ##iation into new freshwater colonies in isolated lakes and streams . [SEP]
[CLS] over an estimated 10 , 000 generations , the stick ##le ##backs show structural differences that are greater than those seen between different genera of fish including variations in fins , changes in the number or size of their bony plates , variable jaw structure , and color differences . [SEP]
[CLS] the isolated populations then undergo gen ##ot ##yp ##ic or ph ##eno ##typic diver ##gence as : ( a ) they become subjected to di ##ssi ##mi ##lar selective pressures ; ( b ) they independently undergo genetic drift ; ( c ) different mutations arise in the two populations . [SEP]
[CLS] when the populations come back into contact , they have evolved such that they are reproductive ##ly isolated and are no longer capable of exchanging genes . [SEP]
[CLS] island genetics is the term associated with the tendency of small , isolated genetic pools to produce unusual traits . [SEP]
[CLS] during his five weeks there he heard that gala ##pa ##gos tor ##to ##ises could be identified by island , and noticed that finch ##es differed from one island to another , but it was only nine months later that he reflected that such facts could show that species were change ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] when he returned to england , his speculation on evolution deepened after experts informed him that these were separate species , not just varieties , and famously that other differing gala ##pa ##gos birds were all species of finch ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] though the finch ##es were less important for darwin , more recent research has shown the birds now known as darwin ' s finch ##es to be a classic case of adaptive evolutionary radiation . [SEP]
[CLS] in per ##ip ##at ##ric spec ##iation , a sub ##form of all ##opa ##tric spec ##iation , new species are formed in isolated , smaller peripheral populations that are prevented from exchanging genes with the main population . [SEP]
[CLS] it is related to the concept of a founder effect , since small populations often undergo bottle ##neck ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in para ##pa ##tric spec ##iation , there is only partial separation of the zones of two diver ##ging populations afforded by geography ; individuals of each species may come in contact or cross habitats from time to time , but reduced fitness of the het ##ero ##zy ##go ##te leads to selection for behaviour ##s or mechanisms that prevent their inter ##bre ##eding . [SEP]
[CLS] para ##pa ##tric spec ##iation is modelled on continuous variation within a " single , " connected habitat acting as a source of natural selection rather than the effects of isolation of habitats produced in per ##ip ##at ##ric and all ##opa ##tric spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] habitat differences may be more important in the development of reproductive isolation than the isolation time . [SEP]
[CLS] a niche must be available in order for a new species to be successful . [SEP]
[CLS] ring species such as " la ##rus " gu ##lls have been claimed to illustrate spec ##iation in progress , though the situation may be more complex . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation is the formation of two or more descendant species from a single ancestral species all occupying the same geographic location . [SEP]
[CLS] bud ##ding spec ##iation has been proposed as a particular form of sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation , whereby small groups of individuals become progressively more isolated from the ancestral stock by breeding prefer ##ential ##ly with one another . [SEP]
[CLS] this type of spec ##iation would be driven by the conjunction of various advantages of in ##bre ##eding such as the expression of advantage ##ous recess ##ive ph ##eno ##type ##s , reducing the rec ##om ##bina ##tion load , and reducing the cost of sex [SEP]
[CLS] the hawthorn fly ( " r ##ha ##gol ##eti ##s po ##mon ##ella " ) , also known as the apple mag ##go ##t fly , appears to be undergoing sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] a distinct population emerged in north america in the 19th century some time after apples , a non - native species , were introduced . [SEP]
[CLS] some evidence , such as that six out of thirteen all ##oz ##yme lo ##ci are different , that hawthorn flies mature later in the season and take longer to mature than apple flies ; and that there is little evidence of inter ##bre ##eding ( researchers have documented a 4 - 6 % hybrid ##ization rate ) suggests that sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation is occurring . [SEP]
[CLS] if their reproductive isolation is incomplete , then further mating between the populations will produce hybrids , which may or may not be fertile . [SEP]
[CLS] if the hybrids are in ##fer ##tile , or fertile but less fit than their ancestors , then there will be further reproductive isolation and spec ##iation has essentially occurred ( e . g . , as in horses and donkey ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the reasoning behind this is that if the parents of the hybrid offspring each have naturally selected traits for their own certain environments , the hybrid offspring will bear traits from both , therefore would not fit either ecological niche as well as either parent . [SEP]
[CLS] this is sometimes called the wallace effect after the evolutionary biologist alfred russ ##el wallace who suggested in the late 19th century that it might be an important factor in spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] conversely , if the hybrid offspring are more fit than their ancestors , then the populations will merge back into the same species within the area they are in contact . [SEP]
[CLS] without reinforcement , the geographic area of contact between different forms of the same species , called their " hybrid zone , " will not develop into a boundary between the different species . [SEP]
[CLS] hybrid offspring are very common in these regions , which are usually created by diver ##ged species coming into secondary contact . [SEP]
[CLS] natural selection is inherently involved in the process of spec ##iation , whereby , " under ecological spec ##iation , populations in different environments , or populations exploit ##ing different resources , experience contrasting natural selection pressures on the traits that directly or indirectly bring about the evolution of reproductive isolation " . [SEP]
[CLS] evidence for the role ecology plays in the process of spec ##iation exists . [SEP]
[CLS] the first and most commonly used sense refers to the “ birth ” of new species . [SEP]
[CLS] that is , the splitting of an existing species into two separate species , or the bud ##ding off of a new species from a parent species , both driven by a biological " fashion fa ##d " ( a preference for a feature , or features , in one or both sexes , that do not necessarily have any adaptive qualities ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the second sense , " spec ##iation " refers to the wide - spread tendency of sexual creatures to be grouped into clearly defined species , rather than forming a continuum of ph ##eno ##type ##s both in time and space - which would be the more obvious or logical consequence of natural selection . [SEP]
[CLS] this was indeed recognized by darwin as problematic , and included in his " on the origin of species " ( 1859 ) , under the heading " difficulties with the theory " . [SEP]
[CLS] there are several suggestions as to how mate choice might play a significant role in resolving . [SEP]
[CLS] new species have been created by animal husband ##ry , but the dates and methods of the initiation of such species are not clear . [SEP]
[CLS] often , the domestic counterpart of the wild ancestor can still inter ##bre ##ed and produce fertile offspring as in the case of domestic cattle , that can be considered the same species as several varieties of wild ox , ga ##ur , ya ##k , etc . , or domestic sheep that can inter ##bre ##ed with the mo ##uf ##lon . [SEP]
[CLS] diane dodd used a laboratory experiment to show how reproductive isolation can develop in " dr ##oso ##phila pseudo ##ob ##scu ##ra " fruit flies after several generations by placing them in different media , star ##ch - and mal ##tose - based media . [SEP]
[CLS] dodd ' s experiment has been easy for many others to replicate , including with other kinds of fruit flies and foods . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatively , these observations are consistent with the notion that sexual creatures are inherently reluctant to mate with individuals whose appearance or behavior is different from the norm . [SEP]
[CLS] they usually involve the reinforcement process of late stages of spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] the order of spec ##iation of three groups from a common ancestor may be unclear or unknown ; a collection of three such species is referred to as a " tri ##cho ##tom ##y . " [SEP]
[CLS] poly ##pl ##oid ##y is a mechanism that has caused many rapid spec ##iation events in sy ##mp ##at ##ry because offspring of , for example , te ##tra ##pl ##oid x dip ##loid mating ##s often result in trip ##loid sterile pro ##geny . [SEP]
[CLS] however , not all poly ##pl ##oids are reproductive ##ly isolated from their parental plants , and gene flow may still occur for example through trip ##loid hybrid x dip ##loid mating ##s that produce te ##tra ##pl ##oids , or mating ##s between mei ##otic ##ally un ##red ##uce ##d game ##tes from dip ##loid ##s and game ##tes from te ##tra ##pl ##oids ( see also hybrid spec ##iation ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this ph ##eno ##type can also be fit ##ter than the parental lineage and as such natural selection may then favor these individuals . [SEP]
[CLS] however , reproductive isolation between hybrids and their parents is particularly difficult to achieve and thus hybrid spec ##iation is considered an extremely rare event . [SEP]
[CLS] poly ##pl ##oid ##y is important in hybrids as it allows reproduction , with the two different sets of chromosomes each being able to pair with an identical partner during mei ##osis . [SEP]
[CLS] theo ##dos ##ius do ##b ##zh ##ans ##ky , who studied fruit flies in the early days of genetic research in 1930s , speculated that parts of chromosomes that switch from one location to another might cause a species to split into two different species . [SEP]
[CLS] he mapped out how it might be possible for sections of chromosomes to relocate themselves in a genome . [SEP]
[CLS] in theory , his idea was sound , but scientists long debated whether it actually happened in nature . [SEP]
[CLS] however , 2006 research shows that jumping of a gene from one chromosome to another can contribute to the birth of new species . [SEP]
[CLS] this valid ##ates the reproductive isolation mechanism , a key component of spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] while some evolutionary biologist ##s claim that spec ##iation events have remained relatively constant and gradual over time ( known as " ph ##yle ##tic gradual ##ism " - see diagram ) , some pal ##ae ##ont ##ologists such as nile ##s el ##dre ##dge and stephen jay gould have argued that species usually remain unchanged over long stretches of time , and that spec ##iation occurs only over relatively brief intervals , a view known as " pun ##ctuated equilibrium " . [SEP]
[CLS] evolution can be extremely rapid , as shown in the creation of domestic ##ated animals and plants in a very short geological space of time , spanning only a few tens of thousands of years . [SEP]
[CLS] this raises the question of why the long term rate of evolution is far slower than is theoretically possible . [SEP]
[CLS] the mutations on which the process depends are random events , and , except for the " silent mutations " which do not affect the functionality or appearance of the carrier , are thus usually disadvantage ##ous , and their chance of proving to be useful in the future is vanishing ##ly small . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , while a species or group might benefit from being able to adapt to a new environment by acc ##um ##ulating a wide range of genetic variation , this is to the det ##rim ##ent of the " individuals " who have to carry these mutations until a small , unpredictable minority of them ultimately contributes to such an adaptation . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the " capability " to evolve would require group selection , a concept disc ##red ##ited by ( for example ) george c . williams , john maynard smith and richard da ##wk ##ins as selective ##ly disadvantage ##ous to the individual . [SEP]
[CLS] mutations that affect the external appearance of their carriers will then rarely be passed on to the next and subsequent generations . [SEP]
[CLS] the only mutations that can accumulate in a population , on this pun ##ctuated equilibrium view , are ones that have no noticeable effect on the outward appearance and functionality of their bearer ##s ( i . e . , they are " silent " or " neutral mutations , " which can be , and are , used to trace the related ##ness and age of populations and species . ) [SEP]
[CLS] this argument implies that evolution can only occur if mutant mates cannot be avoided , as a result of a severe scar ##city of potential mates . [SEP]
[CLS] under these circumstances , not only is the choice of mates severely restricted but population bottle ##neck ##s , founder effects , genetic drift and in ##bre ##eding cause rapid , random changes in the isolated population ' s genetic composition . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , hybrid ##ization with a related species trapped in the same isolate might introduce additional genetic changes . [SEP]
[CLS] if an isolated population such as this survives its genetic up ##hea ##val ##s , and subsequently expands into an uno ##cc ##up ##ied niche , or into a niche in which it has an advantage over its competitors , a new species , or subspecies , will have come in being . [SEP]
[CLS] in apparent confirmation of this pun ##ctuated equilibrium view of evolution , the fossil record of an evolutionary progression typically consists of species that suddenly appear , and ultimately disappear , hundreds of thousands or millions of years later , without any change in external appearance . [SEP]
[CLS] the fact that the lines remain parallel with the time axis illustrates the un ##chang ##ing appearance of each of the fossil species depicted on the graph . [SEP]
[CLS] during each species ' existence new species appear at random intervals , each also lasting many hundreds of thousands of years before disappearing without a change in appearance . [SEP]
[CLS] this is illustrated in the diagram depicting the distribution of ho ##mini ##n species through time since the ho ##mini ##ns separated from the line that led to the evolution of our closest living primate relatives , the chi ##mp ##an ##zee ##s . [SEP]
