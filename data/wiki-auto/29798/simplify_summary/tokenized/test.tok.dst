[CLS] the lord of the rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by english author and scholar j . r . r . tolkien . [SEP]

[CLS] from quiet beginnings in the shire , a ho ##bb ##it land not unlike the english countryside , the story ranges across middle - earth , following the course of the war of the ring through the eyes of its characters , most notably the ho ##bb ##its fr ##od ##o bag ##gins , sam , merry and pip ##pin . [SEP]
[CLS] although generally known to readers as a trilogy , the work was initially intended by tolkien to be one volume of a two - volume set , the other to be " the si ##lma ##rill ##ion " , but this idea was dismissed by his publisher . [SEP]
[CLS] for economic reasons , " the lord of the rings " was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 july 1954 to 20 october 1955 . [SEP]
[CLS] the three volumes were titled " the fellowship of the ring " , " the two towers " and " the return of the king " . [SEP]

[CLS] although a major work in itself , the story was only the last movement of a larger epic tolkien had worked on since 1917 , in a process he described as " myth ##op ##oe ##ia " . [SEP]
[CLS] influences on this earlier work , and on the story of " the lord of the rings " , include philology , mythology , religion and the author ' s di ##sta ##ste for the effects of industrial ##ization , as well as earlier fantasy works and tolkien ' s experiences in world war i . " the lord of the rings " in its turn is considered to have had a great effect on modern fantasy ; the impact of tolkien ' s works is such that the use of the words " tolkien ##ian " and " tolkien ##es ##que " has been recorded in the " oxford english dictionary " .

[CLS] in 2003 , it was named britain ' s best novel of all time in the bbc ' s the big read . [SEP]
[CLS] thousands of years before the events of the novel , the dark lord sa ##uron had forged the one ring to rule the other rings of power and corrupt those who wore them : three for elves , seven for dwarves , and nine for men . [SEP]
[CLS] sa ##uron was defeated by an alliance of elves and men led by gil - gala ##d and el ##end ##il , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] in the final battle , isil ##dur , son of el ##end ##il , cut the one ring from sa ##uron ' s finger , causing sa ##uron to lose his physical form . [SEP]
[CLS] isil ##dur claimed the ring as an heir ##lo ##om for his line , but when he was later ambushed and killed by the or ##cs , the ring was lost in the river and ##uin . [SEP]
[CLS] over two thousand years later , the ring was found by one of the river - folk called dea ##gol . [SEP]
[CLS] his friend sm ##ea ##gol fell under the ring ' s influence and strangled dea ##gol to acquire it . [SEP]
[CLS] sm ##ea ##gol was banished and hid under the misty mountains . [SEP]
[CLS] the ring gave him long life and changed him over hundreds of years into a twisted , corrupted creature called go ##llum . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##llum lost the ring , his " precious " , and as told in " the ho ##bb ##it " , bi ##lb ##o bag ##gins found it . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , sa ##uron assumed a new form and took back his old realm of mor ##dor . [SEP]
[CLS] when go ##llum set out in search of the ring , he was captured and tortured by sa ##uron . [SEP]
[CLS] sa ##uron learned from go ##llum that " bag ##gins " of the shire had taken the ring . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##llum was set loose . [SEP]
[CLS] sa ##uron , who needed the ring to regain his full power , sent forth his powerful servants , the na ##z ##gul , to seize it . [SEP]
[CLS] the story begins in the shire , where the ho ##bb ##it fr ##od ##o bag ##gins inherit ##s the ring from bi ##lb ##o bag ##gins , his cousin and guardian . [SEP]
[CLS] neither ho ##bb ##it is aware of the ring ' s nature , but gan ##dal ##f the grey , a wizard and an old friend of bi ##lb ##o , suspects it to be sa ##uron ' s ring . [SEP]
[CLS] seventeen years later , after gan ##dal ##f confirms his guess , he tells fr ##od ##o the history of the ring and counsel ##s him to take it away from the shire . [SEP]

[CLS] den ##eth ##or is dec ##ei ##ved by sa ##uron and falls into despair . [SEP]

[CLS] they set out across mor ##dor . [SEP]
[CLS] ara ##gor ##n leads an army of men from go ##ndo ##r and rohan to march on the black gate to distract sa ##uron from his true danger . [SEP]
[CLS] his army is vastly outnumbered by the great might of sa ##uron . [SEP]
[CLS] fr ##od ##o and sam reach the edge of the cracks of doom , but fr ##od ##o cannot resist the ring any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] he claims it for himself and puts it on his finger . [SEP]
[CLS] he struggles with fr ##od ##o and bites off fr ##od ##o ' s finger with the ring still on it . [SEP]
[CLS] celebrating wildly , go ##llum loses his footing and falls into the fire , taking the ring with him . [SEP]
[CLS] when the ring is destroyed , sa ##uron loses his power forever . [SEP]
[CLS] all he created collapses , the na ##z ##gul per ##ish , and his armies are thrown into such di ##sar ##ray that ara ##gor ##n ' s forces emerge victorious . [SEP]

[CLS] the four ho ##bb ##its make their way back to the shire , only to find that it has been taken over by men directed by one " shark ##ey " ( whom they later discover to be sar ##uman ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the ho ##bb ##its raise a rebellion and li ##ber ##ate the shire , though 19 ho ##bb ##its are killed and 30 wounded . [SEP]
[CLS] fr ##od ##o stops the ho ##bb ##its from killing the wizard after sar ##uman attempts to stab fr ##od ##o , but grim ##a turns on sar ##uman and kills him in front of bag end , fr ##od ##o ' s home . [SEP]
[CLS] he is slain in turn by ho ##bb ##it archers , and the war of the ring comes to its true end on fr ##od ##o ' s very doorstep . [SEP]
[CLS] merry and pip ##pin are celebrated as heroes . [SEP]
[CLS] sam marries rosie cotton and uses his gifts from gala ##dr ##iel to help heal the shire . [SEP]
[CLS] but fr ##od ##o is still wounded in body and spirit , having borne the ring for so long . [SEP]
[CLS] a few years later , in the company of bi ##lb ##o and gan ##dal ##f , fr ##od ##o sails from the grey haven ##s west over the sea to the und ##ying lands to find peace . [SEP]
[CLS] in the app ##end ##ices , sam gives his daughter el ##anor the " red book of west ##mar ##ch " , which contains the story of bi ##lb ##o ' s adventures and the war of the ring as witnessed by the ho ##bb ##its . [SEP]
[CLS] sam is then said to have crossed west over the sea himself , the last of the ring - bearer ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] some characters in " the lord of the rings " are une ##qui ##vo ##cal protagonists , and others are absolute antagonist ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] however despite criticism that the book ' s characters " are all either black or white " , some of the ' good ' characters have darker sides that feature in the story , and likewise some of the villains have " good impulse ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore the cat ##ego ##rization of characters as either ' protagonists ' or ' antagonist ##s ' below indicates their " general " role in the story . [SEP]
[CLS] " the lord of the rings " started as a sequel to j . r . r . tolkien ' s work " the ho ##bb ##it , " published in 1937 . [SEP]
[CLS] the popularity of " the ho ##bb ##it " had led george allen & un ##win , the publishers , to request a sequel . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien warned them that he wrote quite slowly , and responded with several stories he had already developed . [SEP]
[CLS] having rejected his contemporary drafts for " the si ##lma ##rill ##ion " , putting on hold " rover ##ando ##m " , and accepting " farmer giles of ham " , allen & un ##win thought more stories about ho ##bb ##its would be popular . [SEP]
[CLS] so at the age of 45 , tolkien began writing the story that would become " the lord of the rings . " [SEP]
[CLS] the story would not be finished until 12 years later , in 1949 , and would not be fully published until 1955 , when tolkien was 63 years old . [SEP]
[CLS] persuaded by his publishers , he started " a new ho ##bb ##it " in december 1937 . [SEP]
[CLS] after several false starts , the story of the one ring emerged . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea for the first chapter ( " a long - expected party " ) arrived fully formed , although the reasons behind bi ##lb ##o ' s disappearance , the significance of the ring , and the title " the lord of the rings " did not arrive until the spring of 1938 . [SEP]
[CLS] originally , he planned to write a story in which bi ##lb ##o had used up all his treasure and was looking for another adventure to gain more ; however , he remembered the ring and its powers and thought that would be a better focus for the new work . [SEP]
[CLS] as the story progressed , he also brought in elements from " the si ##lma ##rill ##ion " mythology . [SEP]
[CLS] writing was slow , because tolkien had a full - time academic position , and needed to earn further money as a university examiner . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien abandoned " the lord of the rings " during most of 1943 and only restarted it in april 1944 , as a serial for his son christopher tolkien , who was sent chapters as they were written while he was serving in south africa with the royal air force . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien made another concert ##ed effort in 1946 , and showed the manuscript to his publishers in 1947 . [SEP]
[CLS] the story was effectively finished the next year , but tolkien did not complete the revision of earlier parts of the work until 1949 . [SEP]
[CLS] the original manuscripts , which total 9 , 250 pages , now reside in the j . r . r . tolkien collection at marquette university . [SEP]
[CLS] the influence of the welsh language , which tolkien had learned , is summarized in his essay english and welsh : " if i may once more refer to my work . [SEP]
[CLS] the lord of the rings , in evidence : the names of persons and places in this story were mainly composed on patterns deliberately modelled on those of welsh ( closely similar but not identical ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this element in the tale has given perhaps more pleasure to more readers than anything else in it . " [SEP]
[CLS] " the lord of the rings " developed as a personal exploration by tolkien of his interests in philology , religion ( particularly catholicism ) , fairy tales , norse and general germanic mythology , and also celtic , slavic , persian , greek , and finnish mythology . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien acknowledged , and external critics have verified , the influences of george macdonald and william morris and the anglo - saxon poem " be ##ow ##ulf " . [SEP]
[CLS] the question of a direct influence of wagner ' s " the ni ##bel ##ung ' s ring " on tolkien ' s work is debated by critics . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien included neither any explicit religion nor cult in his work . [SEP]
[CLS] rather the themes , moral philosophy , and co ##smo ##logy of " the lord of the rings " reflect his catholic world ##view . [SEP]
[CLS] in one of his letters tolkien states , " the lord of the rings is of course a fundamentally religious and catholic work ; unconscious ##ly so at first , but consciously in the revision . [SEP]
[CLS] that is why i have not put in , or have cut out , practically all references to anything like ' religion ' , to cult ##s or practices , in the imaginary world . [SEP]
[CLS] for the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism . " [SEP]
[CLS] some locations and characters were inspired by tolkien ' s childhood in birmingham , where he first lived near sar ##eh ##ole mill , and later near ed ##gb ##ast ##on reservoir . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also hints of the black country , which is within easy reach of northwest ed ##gb ##ast ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] this shows in such names as " under ##hill " , and the description of sar ##uman ' s industrial ##ization of is ##eng ##ard and the shire . [SEP]
[CLS] it has also been suggested that the shire and its surroundings were based on the countryside around stony ##hurst college in lancashire where tolkien frequently stayed during the 1940s . [SEP]
[CLS] the work was influenced by the effects of his military service during world war i , to the point that fr ##od ##o has been diagnosed as suffering from post ##tra ##umatic stress disorder , which was first diagnosed as " shell - shock " at the battle of the somme , in which tolkien served . [SEP]
[CLS] a dispute with his publisher , george allen & un ##win , led to the book being offered to collins in 1950 . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien intended " the si ##lma ##rill ##ion " ( itself largely un ##re ##vis ##ed at this point ) to be published along with " the lord of the rings , " but a & u were unwilling to do this . [SEP]
[CLS] after milton wal ##dman , his contact at collins , expressed the belief that " the lord of the rings " itself " urgently wanted cutting " , tolkien eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952 . [SEP]
[CLS] collins did not ; and so tolkien wrote to allen and un ##win , saying , " i would gladly consider the publication of any part of the stuff " , fearing his work would never see the light of day . [SEP]
[CLS] for publication , the book was divided into three volumes to minimize any potential financial loss due to the high cost of type - setting and modest anticipated sales : " the fellowship of the ring " ( books i and ii ) , " the two towers " ( books iii and iv ) , and " the return of the king " ( books v and vi plus six app ##end ##ices ) . [SEP]
[CLS] delays in producing app ##end ##ices , maps and especially an index led to the volumes being published later than originally hoped – on 29 july 1954 , on 11 november 1954 and on 20 october 1955 respectively in the united kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , houghton mi ##ff ##lin published " the fellowship of the ring " on 21 october 1954 , " the two towers " on 21 april 1955 , and " the return of the king " on 5 january 1956 . [SEP]
[CLS] " the return of the king " was especially delayed due to tolkien rev ##ising the ending and preparing app ##end ##ices ( some of which had to be left out because of space constraints ) . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien did not like the title " the return of the king " , believing it gave away too much of the storyline , but def ##erre ##d to his publisher ' s preference . [SEP]
[CLS] he suggested the title " the two towers " in a deliberately ambiguous attempt to link the un ##connected books iii and iv , and as such the eponymous towers could be either or ##than ##c and bar ##ad - du ##r , or minas ti ##rith and bar ##ad - du ##r , or or ##than ##c and ci ##rith un ##gol . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien was initially opposed to titles being given to each two - book volume , preferring instead the use of book titles : e . g . " the lord of the rings " : vol . [SEP]
[CLS] 1 , " the ring sets out " and " the ring goes south " ; vol . [SEP]
[CLS] 2 , " the treason of is ##eng ##ard " and " the ring goes east " ; vol . [SEP]
[CLS] 3 , " the war of the ring " and " the end of the third age " . [SEP]
[CLS] however these individual book titles were later scrapped , and after pressure from his publishers , tolkien initially suggested the titles : vol . [SEP]
[CLS] 1 , " the shadow grows " ; vol . [SEP]
[CLS] 2 , " the ring in the shadow " ; vol . [SEP]
[CLS] 3 , " the war of the ring " or " the return of the king " . [SEP]
[CLS] because the three - volume binding was so widely distributed , the work is often referred to as the " lord of the rings " " trilogy " . [SEP]
[CLS] in a letter to the poet w . h . au ##den ( who famously reviewed the final volume in 1956 ) , tolkien himself made use of the term " trilogy " for the work though he did at other times consider this incorrect , as it was written and conceived as a single book . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also often called a novel ; however , tolkien also objected to this term as he viewed it as a heroic romance . [SEP]
[CLS] the books were published under a profit - sharing arrangement , whereby tolkien would not receive an advance or royalties until the books had broken even , after which he would take a large share of the profits . [SEP]
[CLS] it has ultimately become one of the best - selling novels ever written , with 50 million copies sold by 2003 and over 150 million copies sold by 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] the book was published in the uk by allen & un ##win until 1990 when the publisher and its assets were acquired by harper ##coll ##ins . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 1960s donald a . wo ##ll ##heim , science fiction editor of the paperback publisher ace books , claimed that " the lord of the rings " was not protected in the united states under american copyright law because houghton mi ##ff ##lin , the us hardcover publisher , had neglected to copyright the work in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] then , in 1965 , ace books proceeded to publish an edition , unauthorized by tolkien and without paying royalties to him . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien took issue with this and quickly notified his fans of this objection . [SEP]
[CLS] grass - roots pressure from these fans became so great that ace books withdrew their edition and made a nominal payment to tolkien . [SEP]
[CLS] authorized editions followed from ball ##ant ##ine books and houghton mi ##ff ##lin to tremendous commercial success . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien undertook various textual revisions to produce a version of the book that would be published with his consent and establish an un ##quest ##ioned us copyright . [SEP]
[CLS] this text became the second edition of " the lord of the rings " , published in 1965 . [SEP]
[CLS] the first ball ##ant ##ine paperback edition was printed in october that year , and sold a quarter of a million copies within ten months . [SEP]
[CLS] on september 4 , 1966 , the novel debuted on new york times ' paperback bestseller ##s list as number three , and was number one by december 4 , a position it held for eight weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] houghton mi ##ff ##lin editions after 1994 consolidate variant revisions by tolkien , and corrections supervised by christopher tolkien , which resulted , after some initial g ##lit ##ches , in a computer - based unified text . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2004 , for the 50th anniversary edition , wayne g . hammond and christina sc ##ull , under supervision from christopher tolkien , studied and revised the text to eliminate as many errors and inc ##ons ##iste ##ncies as possible , some of which had been introduced by well - meaning com ##po ##sitor ##s of the first printing in 1954 , and never been corrected . [SEP]
[CLS] the 2005 edition of the book contained further corrections noticed by the editors and submitted by readers . [SEP]
[CLS] further corrections were added to the 60th anniversary edition in 2014 . [SEP]
[CLS] several editions , notably the 50th anniversary edition , combine all three books into one volume , with the result that pa ##gina ##tion varies widely over the various editions . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1988 to 1992 christopher tolkien published the surviving drafts of " the lord of the rings " , chronic ##ling and illuminating with commentary the stages of the text ' s development , in volumes 6 – 9 of his history of middle - earth series . [SEP]

[CLS] tolkien , an expert in philology , examined many of these translations , and made comments on each that reflect both the translation process and his work . [SEP]
[CLS] as he was unhappy with some choices made by early translators , such as the swedish translation by ak ##e oh ##lma ##rks , tolkien wrote a " guide to the names in the lord of the rings " ( 1967 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] because " the lord of the rings " pu ##rp ##ort ##s to be a translation of the fictitious " red book of west ##mar ##ch " , with the english language representing the west ##ron of the " original " , tolkien suggested that translators attempt to capture the inter ##play between english and the invented nomenclature of the english work , and gave several examples along with general guidance . [SEP]
[CLS] while early reviews for " the lord of the rings " were mixed , reviews in various media have been , on the whole , highly positive and acknowledge tolkien ' s literary achievement as a significant one . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial review in the " sunday telegraph " described it as " among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century " . [SEP]
[CLS] the " sunday times " echoed this sentiment , stating that " the english - speaking world is divided into those who have read " the lord of the rings " and " the ho ##bb ##it " and those who are going to read them " . [SEP]
[CLS] the " new york herald tribune " also seemed to have an idea of how popular the books would become , writing in its review that they were " destined to out ##las ##t our time " . [SEP]
[CLS] w . h . au ##den , an admire ##r of tolkien ' s writings , regarded " the lord of the rings " as a " masterpiece " , further stating that in some cases it out ##di ##d the achievement of john milton ' s " paradise lost " . [SEP]
[CLS] " new york times " reviewer judith shu ##lev ##itz criticized the " pe ##dant ##ry " of tolkien ' s literary style , saying that he " formulated a high - minded belief in the importance of his mission as a literary preservation ##ist , which turns out to be death to literature itself " . [SEP]
[CLS] critic richard jen ##ky ##ns , writing in " the new republic " , criticized the work for a lack of psychological depth . [SEP]
[CLS] both the characters and the work itself are , according to jen ##ky ##ns , " an ##emi ##c , and lacking in fibre " . [SEP]
[CLS] even within tolkien ' s literary group , the ink ##lings , reviews were mixed . [SEP]
[CLS] hugo d ##yson complained loudly at its readings . [SEP]
[CLS] however , another ink ##ling , c . s . lewis , had very different feelings , writing , " here are beau ##ties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron . [SEP]
[CLS] here is a book which will break your heart . " [SEP]
[CLS] despite these reviews and its lack of paperback printing until the 1960s , " the lord of the rings " initially sold well in hard ##back . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1957 , " the lord of the rings " was awarded the international fantasy award . [SEP]
[CLS] despite its numerous det ##rac ##tors , the publication of the ace books and ball ##ant ##ine paperback ##s helped " the lord of the rings " become immensely popular in the united states in the 1960s . [SEP]
[CLS] the book has remained so ever since , ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century , judged by both sales and reader surveys . [SEP]

[CLS] although " the lord of the rings " was published in the 1950s , tolkien insisted that the one ring was not an all ##ego ##ry for the atomic bomb , nor were his works a strict all ##ego ##ry of any kind , but were open to interpretation as the reader saw fit . [SEP]
[CLS] a few critics have found what they consider racial elements in the story , which are generally based upon their views of how tolkien ' s imagery depicts good and evil , characters ' race ( e . g . elf , dwarf , ho ##bb ##it , south ##ron , nu ##men ##ore ##an , or ##c ) , and how the characters ' race is seen as determining their behaviour . [SEP]
[CLS] on the contrary , counter - arguments note that race - focused critique ##s often om ##it relevant textual evidence , cite imagery from adaptations rather than the work itself , ignore the absence of evidence of racist attitudes or events in the author ' s personal life , and claim that the perception of racism is itself a marginal view . [SEP]
[CLS] the opinions that pit races against each other most likely reflect tolkien ' s criticism of war rather than a racist perspective . [SEP]
[CLS] in " the two towers " , the character sam ##wise sees a fallen foe and for a moment he considers the humanity of this fallen south ##ron who , just moments before , was shown to be a man of color . [SEP]
[CLS] director peter jackson considers sam in the director ' s commentary of the scene and argues that tolkien isn ' t projecting any negative sentiments towards the individual soldier because of his race , but the evil that ' s driving them from their authority . [SEP]
[CLS] these sentiments , jackson argues , were derived from tolkien ' s experience in the great war and found their way into his writings to show the evil ##s of war itself , not of other races . [SEP]
[CLS] critics have also seen social class rather than race as being the determining factor in the portrayal of good and evil . [SEP]
[CLS] commentators such as science fiction author david br ##in have interpreted the work to hold un ##quest ##ion ##ing devotion to a traditional eli ##tist social structure . [SEP]
[CLS] in his essay " epic po ##oh " , science fiction and fantasy author michael moor ##cock critique ##s the world - view displayed by the book as deeply conservative , in both the " paternal ##ism " of the narrative voice and the power - structures in the narrative . [SEP]
[CLS] tom ship ##pe ##y cites the origin of this portrayal of evil as a reflection of the prejudice ##s of european middle - classes during the inter - war years towards the industrial working class . [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] the eventual director of the film adaptation peter jackson further explained that a major hind ##rance to the project ' s progression was tolkien ' s opposition to the involvement of the beatles . [SEP]
[CLS] british director john boo ##rman also tried to make an adaptation of " the lord of the rings " for united artists in 1970 . [SEP]

[CLS] however , gary g ##y ##ga ##x , lead designer of the game , maintained that he was influenced very little by " the lord of the rings " , stating that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity the work enjoyed at the time he was developing the game . [SEP]
[CLS] because d & d has gone on to influence many popular role - playing video games , the influence of " the lord of the rings " extends to many of them as well , with titles such as " dragon quest " , the " ul ##ti ##ma " series , " ever ##quest " , the " war ##craft " series , and the " elder scrolls " series of games as well as video games set in middle - earth itself .
