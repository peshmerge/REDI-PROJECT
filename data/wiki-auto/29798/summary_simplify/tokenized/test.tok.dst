[CLS] the lord of the rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by english author and scholar j . r . r . tolkien . [SEP]
[CLS] the story began as a sequel to tolkien ' s 1937 fantasy novel " the ho ##bb ##it " , but eventually developed into a much larger work . [SEP]
[CLS] written in stages between 1937 and 1949 , " the lord of the rings " is one of the best - selling novels ever written , with over 150 million copies sold . [SEP]
[CLS] the title of the novel refers to the story ' s main antagonist , the dark lord sa ##uron , who had in an earlier age created the one ring to rule the other rings of power as the ultimate weapon in his campaign to conquer and rule all of middle - earth . [SEP]
[CLS] from quiet beginnings in the shire , a ho ##bb ##it land not unlike the english countryside , the story ranges across middle - earth , following the course of the war of the ring through the eyes of its characters , most notably the ho ##bb ##its fr ##od ##o bag ##gins , sam , merry and pip ##pin . [SEP]
[CLS] although generally known to readers as a trilogy , the work was initially intended by tolkien to be one volume of a two - volume set , the other to be " the si ##lma ##rill ##ion " , but this idea was dismissed by his publisher . [SEP]
[CLS] for economic reasons , " the lord of the rings " was published in three volumes over the course of a year from 29 july 1954 to 20 october 1955 . [SEP]
[CLS] structurally , the novel is divided internally into six books , two per volume , with several app ##end ##ices of background material included at the end . [SEP]
[CLS] " the lord of the rings " has since been reprinted numerous times and translated into 38 languages . [SEP]
[CLS] although a major work in itself , the story was only the last movement of a larger epic tolkien had worked on since 1917 , in a process he described as " myth ##op ##oe ##ia " . [SEP]
[CLS] influences on this earlier work , and on the story of " the lord of the rings " , include philology , mythology , religion and the author ' s di ##sta ##ste for the effects of industrial ##ization , as well as earlier fantasy works and tolkien ' s experiences in world war i . [SEP]
[CLS] " the lord of the rings " in its turn is considered to have had a great effect on modern fantasy ; the impact of tolkien ' s works is such that the use of the words " tolkien ##ian " and " tolkien ##es ##que " has been recorded in the " oxford english dictionary " . [SEP]

[CLS] award - winning adaptations of " the lord of the rings " have been made for radio , theatre , and film . [SEP]
[CLS] thousands of years before the events of the novel , the dark lord sa ##uron had forged the one ring to rule the other rings of power and corrupt those who wore them : three for elves , seven for dwarves , and nine for men . [SEP]
[CLS] isil ##dur claimed the ring as an heir ##lo ##om for his line , but when he was later ambushed and killed by the or ##cs , the ring was lost in the river and ##uin . [SEP]
[CLS] over two thousand years later , the ring was found by one of the river - folk called dea ##gol . [SEP]
[CLS] the ring gave him long life and changed him over hundreds of years into a twisted , corrupted creature called go ##llum . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , sa ##uron assumed a new form and took back his old realm of mor ##dor . [SEP]
[CLS] when go ##llum set out in search of the ring , he was captured and tortured by sa ##uron . [SEP]
[CLS] sa ##uron learned from go ##llum that " bag ##gins " of the shire had taken the ring . [SEP]
[CLS] sa ##uron , who needed the ring to regain his full power , sent forth his powerful servants , the na ##z ##gul , to seize it . [SEP]
[CLS] neither ho ##bb ##it is aware of the ring ' s nature , but gan ##dal ##f the grey , a wizard and an old friend of bi ##lb ##o , suspects it to be sa ##uron ' s ring . [SEP]
[CLS] seventeen years later , after gan ##dal ##f confirms his guess , he tells fr ##od ##o the history of the ring and counsel ##s him to take it away from the shire . [SEP]

[CLS] the black riders nearly capture him at the ford of br ##uin ##en , but flood waters summoned by el ##ron ##d , master of ri ##ven ##dell , rise up and over ##w ##helm them . [SEP]
[CLS] the council of el ##ron ##d discusses the history of sa ##uron and the ring . [SEP]
[CLS] gan ##dal ##f reports that the chief wizard sar ##uman has betrayed them and is now working to become a power in his own right . [SEP]
[CLS] the council decides that the ring must be destroyed , but that can only be done by sending it to the fire of mount doom in mor ##dor , where it was forged . [SEP]
[CLS] the company of the ring are nine in number : fr ##od ##o , sam , merry , pip ##pin , ara ##gor ##n , gan ##dal ##f , gi ##ml ##i the dwarf , lego ##las the elf , and the man bo ##rom ##ir , son of den ##eth ##or , the ruling steward of the land of go ##ndo ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] after a failed attempt to cross the misty mountains over the red ##horn pass , the company take the per ##ilo ##us path through the mines of mori ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] with boats and gifts from gala ##dr ##iel , the company travel down the river and ##uin to the hill of am ##on hen . [SEP]

[CLS] it is revealed to be a " pal ##ant ##ir " , a seeing - stone that sar ##uman used to speak with sa ##uron and through which sar ##uman was en ##s ##nare ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] they find that the black gate of mor ##dor is too well guarded , so instead they travel to a secret way go ##llum knows . [SEP]
[CLS] on the way , they encounter far ##ami ##r , who , unlike his brother bo ##rom ##ir , resist ##s the temptation to seize the ring . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##llum – who is torn between his loyalty to fr ##od ##o and his desire for the ring – betray ##s fr ##od ##o by leading him to the great spider she ##lo ##b in the tunnels of ci ##rith un ##gol . [SEP]

[CLS] all he created collapses , the na ##z ##gul per ##ish , and his armies are thrown into such di ##sar ##ray that ara ##gor ##n ' s forces emerge victorious . [SEP]
[CLS] the four ho ##bb ##its make their way back to the shire , only to find that it has been taken over by men directed by one " shark ##ey " ( whom they later discover to be sar ##uman ) . [SEP]
[CLS] he is slain in turn by ho ##bb ##it archers , and the war of the ring comes to its true end on fr ##od ##o ' s very doorstep . [SEP]
[CLS] sam marries rosie cotton and uses his gifts from gala ##dr ##iel to help heal the shire . [SEP]
[CLS] a few years later , in the company of bi ##lb ##o and gan ##dal ##f , fr ##od ##o sails from the grey haven ##s west over the sea to the und ##ying lands to find peace . [SEP]
[CLS] in the app ##end ##ices , sam gives his daughter el ##anor the " red book of west ##mar ##ch " , which contains the story of bi ##lb ##o ' s adventures and the war of the ring as witnessed by the ho ##bb ##its . [SEP]
[CLS] some characters in " the lord of the rings " are une ##qui ##vo ##cal protagonists , and others are absolute antagonist ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] having rejected his contemporary drafts for " the si ##lma ##rill ##ion " , putting on hold " rover ##ando ##m " , and accepting " farmer giles of ham " , allen & un ##win thought more stories about ho ##bb ##its would be popular . [SEP]
[CLS] so at the age of 45 , tolkien began writing the story that would become " the lord of the rings . " [SEP]
[CLS] the idea for the first chapter ( " a long - expected party " ) arrived fully formed , although the reasons behind bi ##lb ##o ' s disappearance , the significance of the ring , and the title " the lord of the rings " did not arrive until the spring of 1938 . [SEP]
[CLS] originally , he planned to write a story in which bi ##lb ##o had used up all his treasure and was looking for another adventure to gain more ; however , he remembered the ring and its powers and thought that would be a better focus for the new work . [SEP]
[CLS] writing was slow , because tolkien had a full - time academic position , and needed to earn further money as a university examiner . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien abandoned " the lord of the rings " during most of 1943 and only restarted it in april 1944 , as a serial for his son christopher tolkien , who was sent chapters as they were written while he was serving in south africa with the royal air force . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien made another concert ##ed effort in 1946 , and showed the manuscript to his publishers in 1947 . [SEP]
[CLS] the story was effectively finished the next year , but tolkien did not complete the revision of earlier parts of the work until 1949 . [SEP]
[CLS] the original manuscripts , which total 9 , 250 pages , now reside in the j . r . r . tolkien collection at marquette university . [SEP]
[CLS] the influence of the welsh language , which tolkien had learned , is summarized in his essay english and welsh : " if i may once more refer to my work . [SEP]
[CLS] the lord of the rings , in evidence : the names of persons and places in this story were mainly composed on patterns deliberately modelled on those of welsh ( closely similar but not identical ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this element in the tale has given perhaps more pleasure to more readers than anything else in it . " [SEP]
[CLS] in one of his letters tolkien states , " the lord of the rings is of course a fundamentally religious and catholic work ; unconscious ##ly so at first , but consciously in the revision . [SEP]
[CLS] that is why i have not put in , or have cut out , practically all references to anything like ' religion ' , to cult ##s or practices , in the imaginary world . [SEP]
[CLS] for the religious element is absorbed into the story and the symbolism . " [SEP]
[CLS] some locations and characters were inspired by tolkien ' s childhood in birmingham , where he first lived near sar ##eh ##ole mill , and later near ed ##gb ##ast ##on reservoir . [SEP]
[CLS] it has also been suggested that the shire and its surroundings were based on the countryside around stony ##hurst college in lancashire where tolkien frequently stayed during the 1940s . [SEP]
[CLS] the work was influenced by the effects of his military service during world war i , to the point that fr ##od ##o has been diagnosed as suffering from post ##tra ##umatic stress disorder , which was first diagnosed as " shell - shock " at the battle of the somme , in which tolkien served . [SEP]
[CLS] a dispute with his publisher , george allen & un ##win , led to the book being offered to collins in 1950 . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien intended " the si ##lma ##rill ##ion " ( itself largely un ##re ##vis ##ed at this point ) to be published along with " the lord of the rings , " but a & u were unwilling to do this . [SEP]
[CLS] after milton wal ##dman , his contact at collins , expressed the belief that " the lord of the rings " itself " urgently wanted cutting " , tolkien eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952 . [SEP]
[CLS] for publication , the book was divided into three volumes to minimize any potential financial loss due to the high cost of type - setting and modest anticipated sales : " the fellowship of the ring " ( books i and ii ) , " the two towers " ( books iii and iv ) , and " the return of the king " ( books v and vi plus six app ##end ##ices ) . [SEP]
[CLS] " the return of the king " was especially delayed due to tolkien rev ##ising the ending and preparing app ##end ##ices ( some of which had to be left out because of space constraints ) . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien did not like the title " the return of the king " , believing it gave away too much of the storyline , but def ##erre ##d to his publisher ' s preference . [SEP]
[CLS] he suggested the title " the two towers " in a deliberately ambiguous attempt to link the un ##connected books iii and iv , and as such the eponymous towers could be either or ##than ##c and bar ##ad - du ##r , or minas ti ##rith and bar ##ad - du ##r , or or ##than ##c and ci ##rith un ##gol . [SEP]
[CLS] because the three - volume binding was so widely distributed , the work is often referred to as the " lord of the rings " " trilogy " . [SEP]
[CLS] in a letter to the poet w . h . au ##den ( who famously reviewed the final volume in 1956 ) , tolkien himself made use of the term " trilogy " for the work though he did at other times consider this incorrect , as it was written and conceived as a single book . [SEP]
[CLS] the books were published under a profit - sharing arrangement , whereby tolkien would not receive an advance or royalties until the books had broken even , after which he would take a large share of the profits . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 1960s donald a . wo ##ll ##heim , science fiction editor of the paperback publisher ace books , claimed that " the lord of the rings " was not protected in the united states under american copyright law because houghton mi ##ff ##lin , the us hardcover publisher , had neglected to copyright the work in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] grass - roots pressure from these fans became so great that ace books withdrew their edition and made a nominal payment to tolkien . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien undertook various textual revisions to produce a version of the book that would be published with his consent and establish an un ##quest ##ioned us copyright . [SEP]
[CLS] this text became the second edition of " the lord of the rings " , published in 1965 . [SEP]
[CLS] the first ball ##ant ##ine paperback edition was printed in october that year , and sold a quarter of a million copies within ten months . [SEP]
[CLS] houghton mi ##ff ##lin editions after 1994 consolidate variant revisions by tolkien , and corrections supervised by christopher tolkien , which resulted , after some initial g ##lit ##ches , in a computer - based unified text . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2004 , for the 50th anniversary edition , wayne g . hammond and christina sc ##ull , under supervision from christopher tolkien , studied and revised the text to eliminate as many errors and inc ##ons ##iste ##ncies as possible , some of which had been introduced by well - meaning com ##po ##sitor ##s of the first printing in 1954 , and never been corrected . [SEP]
[CLS] several editions , notably the 50th anniversary edition , combine all three books into one volume , with the result that pa ##gina ##tion varies widely over the various editions . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1988 to 1992 christopher tolkien published the surviving drafts of " the lord of the rings " , chronic ##ling and illuminating with commentary the stages of the text ' s development , in volumes 6 – 9 of his history of middle - earth series . [SEP]
[CLS] the novel has been translated , with various degrees of success , into at least 56 languages . [SEP]
[CLS] tolkien , an expert in philology , examined many of these translations , and made comments on each that reflect both the translation process and his work . [SEP]
[CLS] as he was unhappy with some choices made by early translators , such as the swedish translation by ak ##e oh ##lma ##rks , tolkien wrote a " guide to the names in the lord of the rings " ( 1967 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] because " the lord of the rings " pu ##rp ##ort ##s to be a translation of the fictitious " red book of west ##mar ##ch " , with the english language representing the west ##ron of the " original " , tolkien suggested that translators attempt to capture the inter ##play between english and the invented nomenclature of the english work , and gave several examples along with general guidance . [SEP]
[CLS] while early reviews for " the lord of the rings " were mixed , reviews in various media have been , on the whole , highly positive and acknowledge tolkien ' s literary achievement as a significant one . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial review in the " sunday telegraph " described it as " among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century " . [SEP]
[CLS] the " new york herald tribune " also seemed to have an idea of how popular the books would become , writing in its review that they were " destined to out ##las ##t our time " . [SEP]
[CLS] w . h . au ##den , an admire ##r of tolkien ' s writings , regarded " the lord of the rings " as a " masterpiece " , further stating that in some cases it out ##di ##d the achievement of john milton ' s " paradise lost " . [SEP]
[CLS] " new york times " reviewer judith shu ##lev ##itz criticized the " pe ##dant ##ry " of tolkien ' s literary style , saying that he " formulated a high - minded belief in the importance of his mission as a literary preservation ##ist , which turns out to be death to literature itself " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , another ink ##ling , c . s . lewis , had very different feelings , writing , " here are beau ##ties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron . [SEP]
[CLS] despite these reviews and its lack of paperback printing until the 1960s , " the lord of the rings " initially sold well in hard ##back . [SEP]
[CLS] despite its numerous det ##rac ##tors , the publication of the ace books and ball ##ant ##ine paperback ##s helped " the lord of the rings " become immensely popular in the united states in the 1960s . [SEP]
[CLS] the book has remained so ever since , ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century , judged by both sales and reader surveys . [SEP]
[CLS] in a 1999 poll of amazon . com customers , " the lord of the rings " was judged to be their favourite " book of the millennium " . [SEP]
[CLS] although " the lord of the rings " was published in the 1950s , tolkien insisted that the one ring was not an all ##ego ##ry for the atomic bomb , nor were his works a strict all ##ego ##ry of any kind , but were open to interpretation as the reader saw fit . [SEP]
[CLS] a few critics have found what they consider racial elements in the story , which are generally based upon their views of how tolkien ' s imagery depicts good and evil , characters ' race ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] on the contrary , counter - arguments note that race - focused critique ##s often om ##it relevant textual evidence , cite imagery from adaptations rather than the work itself , ignore the absence of evidence of racist attitudes or events in the author ' s personal life , and claim that the perception of racism is itself a marginal view . [SEP]
[CLS] in " the two towers " , the character sam ##wise sees a fallen foe and for a moment he considers the humanity of this fallen south ##ron who , just moments before , was shown to be a man of color . [SEP]
[CLS] director peter jackson considers sam in the director ' s commentary of the scene and argues that tolkien isn ' t projecting any negative sentiments towards the individual soldier because of his race , but the evil that ' s driving them from their authority . [SEP]
[CLS] these sentiments , jackson argues , were derived from tolkien ' s experience in the great war and found their way into his writings to show the evil ##s of war itself , not of other races . [SEP]
[CLS] critics have also seen social class rather than race as being the determining factor in the portrayal of good and evil . [SEP]
[CLS] commentators such as science fiction author david br ##in have interpreted the work to hold un ##quest ##ion ##ing devotion to a traditional eli ##tist social structure . [SEP]
[CLS] in his essay " epic po ##oh " , science fiction and fantasy author michael moor ##cock critique ##s the world - view displayed by the book as deeply conservative , in both the " paternal ##ism " of the narrative voice and the power - structures in the narrative . [SEP]
[CLS] tom ship ##pe ##y cites the origin of this portrayal of evil as a reflection of the prejudice ##s of european middle - classes during the inter - war years towards the industrial working class . [SEP]
[CLS] " the lord of the rings " has been adapted for film , radio and stage . [SEP]
[CLS] a 1979 drama ##ti ##zation of " the lord of the rings " was broadcast in the united states and subsequently issued on tape and cd . [SEP]
[CLS] following j . r . r . tolkien ' s sale of the film rights for " the lord of the rings " to united artists in 1969 , rock band the beatles considered a corresponding film project and approached stanley ku ##brick as a potential director ; however , ku ##brick turned down the offer , explaining to john lennon that he thought the novel could not be adapted into a film due to its im ##men ##sity . [SEP]
[CLS] the eventual director of the film adaptation peter jackson further explained that a major hind ##rance to the project ' s progression was tolkien ' s opposition to the involvement of the beatles . [SEP]
[CLS] a three - issue comic book version of the movie was also published in europe ( but not printed in english ) , with illustrations by luis be ##rm ##ej ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] when ba ##kshi ' s investors shi ##ed away of financing the second film that would complete the story , the remainder of the story was covered in an animated television special by rankin - bass . [SEP]
[CLS] the final ins ##tal ##ment of this trilogy was the second film to break the one - billion - dollar barrier and won a total of 11 oscar ##s ( something only two other films in history , " ben - hu ##r " and " titanic " , have accomplished ) , including best picture , best director and best adapted screenplay .

[CLS] largely thanks to " the lord of the rings , " the genre flower ##ed throughout the 1960s , and enjoys popularity to the present day . [SEP]
[CLS] the opus has spawned many im ##ita ##tors , such as " the sword of shan ##nar ##a " , which lin carter called " the single most cold - blooded , complete rip - off of another book that i have ever read " . [SEP]
[CLS] " dungeons & dragons " , which popularized the role - playing game ( rpg ) genre in the 1970s , features many races found in " the lord of the rings , " most notably half ##lings ( another term for ho ##bb ##its ) , elves , dwarves , half - elves , or ##cs , and dragons . [SEP]
[CLS] however , gary g ##y ##ga ##x , lead designer of the game , maintained that he was influenced very little by " the lord of the rings " , stating that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity the work enjoyed at the time he was developing the game . [SEP]
[CLS] because d & d has gone on to influence many popular role - playing video games , the influence of " the lord of the rings " extends to many of them as well , with titles such as " dragon quest " , the " ul ##ti ##ma " series , " ever ##quest " , the " war ##craft " series , and the " elder scrolls " series of games as well as video games set in middle - earth itself . [SEP]
[CLS] research also suggests that some consumers of fantasy games derive their motivation from trying to create an epic fantasy narrative which is influenced by " the lord of the rings " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1965 , songwriter donald swan ##n , who was best known for his collaboration with michael flanders as flanders & swan ##n , set six poems from " the lord of the rings " and one from " the adventures of tom bomb ##adi ##l " ( " er ##rant ##ry " ) to music . [SEP]
[CLS] when swan ##n met with tolkien to play the songs for his approval , tolkien suggested for " nam ##ari ##e " ( gala ##dr ##iel ' s lame ##nt ) a setting reminiscent of plain chant , which swan ##n accepted . [SEP]
[CLS] the songs were published in 1967 as " the road goes ever on : a song cycle " , and a recording of the songs performed by singer william el ##vin with swan ##n on piano was issued that same year by ca ##ed ##mon records as " poems and songs of middle earth " . [SEP]
[CLS] rock bands of the 1970s were musically and lyrical ##ly inspired by the fantasy embracing counter - culture of the time ; british 70s rock band led zeppelin recorded several songs that contain explicit references to " the lord of the rings " , such as mentioning go ##llum in " ram ##ble on " , the misty mountains in " misty mountain hop " , and ring ##wr ##aith ##s in " the battle of ever ##more " .

[CLS] the album was subsequently released internationally as " music inspired by lord of the rings " in 1972 . [SEP]
[CLS] styx also paid homage to tolkien on their album " pieces of eight " with the song " lords of the ring " , while black sabbath ' s song , " the wizard " , which appeared on their debut album , was influenced by tolkien ' s hero , gan ##dal ##f . [SEP]
[CLS] progressive rock group camel paid homage to the text in their lengthy composition " ni ##m ##rod ##el / the procession / the white rider " , and progressive rock band barclay james harvest was inspired by the character gala ##dr ##iel to write a song by that name , and used " bomb ##adi ##l " , the name of another character , as a pseudonym under which their 1972 single " breathless " / " when the city sleeps " was released ; there are other references scattered through the b ##j ##h o ##eu ##vre .

[CLS] later , from the 1980s to the present day , many heavy metal acts have been influenced by tolkien . [SEP]
[CLS] summon ##ing ' s music is based upon tolkien and holds the distinction of the being the only artist to have crafted a song entirely in the black speech of mor ##dor . [SEP]
[CLS] the finnish metal band night ##wi ##sh and the norwegian metal band tristan ##ia have also incorporated many tolkien references into their music . [SEP]
