Complications may include seizures, hallucinations, trouble speaking, memory problems, and problems with hearing.
Causes of encephalitis include viruses such as herpes simplex virus and rabies as well as bacteria, fungi, or parasites.
Once the immediate problem is under control, rehabilitation may be required.
Adults with encephalitis present with acute onset of fever, headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures.
Younger children or infants may present with irritability, poor appetite and fever.
Stiff neck, due to the irritation of the meninges covering the brain, indicates that the patient has either meningitis or meningoencephalitis.
Viral encephalitis can occur either as a direct effect of an acute infection, or as one of the sequelae of a latent infection.
The majority of viral cases of encephalitis have an unknown cause, however the most common identifiable cause of viral encephalitis is from herpes simplex infection.
The Powassan virus is a rare cause of encephalitis.
It can be caused by a bacterial infection, such as bacterial meningitis, or may be a complication of a current infectious disease syphilis (secondary encephalitis).
Certain parasitic or protozoal infestations, such as toxoplasmosis, malaria, or primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, can also cause encephalitis in people with compromised immune systems.
Other bacterial pathogens, like "Mycoplasma" and those causing rickettsial disease, cause inflammation of the meninges and consequently encephalitis.
Limbic encephalitis refers to inflammatory disease confined to the limbic system of the brain.
The clinical presentation often includes disorientation, disinhibition, memory loss, seizures, and behavioral anomalies.
MRI imaging reveals T2 hyperintensity in the structures of the medial temporal lobes, and in some cases, other limbic structures.
Some cases of limbic encephalitis are of autoimmune origin.
Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is the most common autoimmune form, and is accompanied by ovarian teratoma in 58 percent of affected women 18–45 years of age.
Individuals can exhibit upper body weakness, muscular pains, and tremors, though the cause of encephalitis lethargica is not currently known.
People should only be diagnosed with encephalitis if they have a decreased or altered level of consciousness, lethargy, or personality change for at least twenty-four hours without any other explainable cause.
Vaccination is available against tick-borne and Japanese encephalitis and should be considered for at-risk individuals.
Contraindication to Pertussis immunization should be observed in patients with encephalitis.
Pyrimethamine-based maintenance therapy is often used to treat Toxoplasmic Encephalitis (TE), which is caused by Toxoplasma gondii and can be life-threatening for people with weak immune systems.
The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), in conjunction with the established pyrimethamine-based maintenance therapy, decreases the chance of relapse in patients with HIV and TE from approximately 18% to 11%.
This is a significant difference as relapse may impact the severity and prognosis of disease and result in an increase in healthcare expenditure.
Identification of poor prognostic factors include cerebral edema, status epilepticus, and thrombocytopenia.
In contrast, a normal encephalogram at the early stages of diagnosis is associated with high rates of survival.
The number of new cases a year of acute encephalitis in Western countries is 7.4 cases per 100,000 people per year.
Herpes simplex encephalitis has an incidence of 2–4 per million of the population per year.
