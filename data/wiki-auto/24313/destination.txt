A phantom island is an island that was thought to exist at some point in time.
Because of this, the island was shown on a map.
Later, the islands were removed from maps.
Some islands are described and later on change their name, or with the description given it is possible to associate a real island.
Other islands sink below sea level because of natural causes such as erosion.
Such islands still exist.
Two examples are Earnest Legouve Reef and Maria-Theresa Reef in the South Pacific.

One example of this is New South Greenland, which was observed in the Weddell Sea in 1823, and has not been seen since.
Some phantom islands may have existed, but they have been destroyed, or are no longer above the water line.
These include Thompson Island in the South Atlantic, and Bermeja, off the coast of Yucatán.
