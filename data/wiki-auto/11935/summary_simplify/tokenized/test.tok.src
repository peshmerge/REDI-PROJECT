[CLS] germany is a democratic , federal parliamentary republic , where federal legislative power is vested in the bun ##des ##tag ( the parliament of germany ) and the bun ##des ##rat ( the representative body of the land ##er , germany ' s regional states ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the multi ##lateral system has , since 1949 , been dominated by the christian democratic union ( cd ##u ) and the social democratic party of germany ( spd ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the judiciary of germany is independent of the executive and the legislature , while it is common for leading members of the executive to be members of the legislature as well . [SEP]
[CLS] the political system is laid out in the 1949 constitution , the " gr ##und ##ges ##etz " ( basic law ) , which remained in effect with minor amendments after german reunification in 1990 . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution emphasizes the protection of individual liberty in an extensive catalogue of human and civil rights and divides powers both between the federal and state levels and between the legislative , executive and judicial branches . [SEP]
[CLS] the economist intelligence unit has rated germany as a " full democracy " in 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] after 1949 , the federal republic of germany had christian democratic chancellor ##s for 20 years until a coalition between the social democrats and the liberals took over . [SEP]
[CLS] in this period fell the reunification of germany , in 1990 : the german democratic republic joined the federal republic . [SEP]
[CLS] the political system of the federal republic remained more or less unchanged . [SEP]
[CLS] specific provisions for the former g ##dr territory were enabled via the " unification treaty " between the federal republic and the g ##dr prior to the unification day of 3 october 1990 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , germany saw in the following two distinct party systems : the green party and the liberals remained mostly west german parties , while in the east the former socialist state party , now called pd ##s , flourished along with the christian democrats and social democrats . [SEP]
[CLS] after 16 years of the christian – liberal coalition , led by helmut ko ##hl , the social democratic party of germany ( spd ) together with the greens won the bun ##des ##tag elections of 1998 . [SEP]
[CLS] the ko ##hl government was hurt at the polls by slower economic growth in the east in the previous two years , and constantly high unemployment . [SEP]
[CLS] the final margin of victory was sufficiently high to permit a " red - green " coalition of the spd with alliance 90 / the greens ( " bun ##d ##nis ' 90 / die gr ##une ##n " ) , bringing the greens into a national government for the first time . [SEP]
[CLS] initial problems of the new government , marked by policy disputes between the moderate and traditional left wings of the spd , resulted in some voter di ##sa ##ffe ##ction . [SEP]
[CLS] gerhard sc ##hr ##oder led the coalition of spd and greens to an eleven - seat victory over the christian democrat challenger ##s headed by edmund st ##oi ##ber ( cs ##u ) . [SEP]
[CLS] three factors are generally cited that enabled sc ##hr ##oder to win the elections despite poor approval ratings a few months before and a weaker economy : good handling of the 100 - year flood , firm opposition to the us 2003 invasion of iraq , and st ##oi ##ber ' s unpopular ##ity in the east , which cost the cd ##u crucial seats there . [SEP]
[CLS] in its second term , the red – green coalition lost several very important state elections , for example in lower saxony where sc ##hr ##oder was the prime minister from 1990 to 1998 . [SEP]
[CLS] although these reforms sparked massive protests , they are now credited with being in part responsible for the relatively strong economic performance of germany during the euro - crisis and the decrease in unemployment in germany in the years 2006 - 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] half an hour after the election results , the spd chairman franz mu ##nte ##fer ##ing announced that the chancellor would clear the way for new federal elections . [SEP]
[CLS] new for the 2005 election was the alliance between the newly formed electoral alternative for labor and social justice ( was ##g ) and the pd ##s , planning to fuse into a common party ( see left party . pd ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] whereas in may and june 2005 victory of the christian democrats seemed highly likely , with some polls giving them an absolute majority , this picture changed shortly before the election on 18 september 2005 . [SEP]
[CLS] the christian democrats even lost votes compared to 2002 , narrowly reaching the first place with only 35 . 2 % , and failed to get a majority for a " black – yellow " government of cd ##u / cs ##u and liberal f ##dp . [SEP]
[CLS] three party coalition ##s and coalition ##s involving the left had been ruled out by all interested parties ( including the left itself ) . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result of that federal election , the grand coalition brought losses for both parties and came to an end . [SEP]
[CLS] the spd suffered the heaviest losses in its history and was unable to form a coalition government . [SEP]
[CLS] the three smaller parties thus had more seats in the german " bun ##des ##tag " than ever before , with the liberal party f ##dp winning 14 . 6 % of votes . [SEP]
[CLS] the f ##dp had promised to lower taxes in the electoral campaign , but after being part of the coalition they had to con ##cede that this was not possible due to the economic crisis of 2008 . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the losses , guido west ##er ##well ##e had to resign as chair of the f ##dp in favor of philipp ro ##sler , federal minister of health , who was consequently appointed as vice chancellor . [SEP]
[CLS] he resigned on 16 january 2017 and proposed his longtime friend and president of european parliament martin sc ##hul ##z as his successor and chancellor candidate . [SEP]
[CLS] germany has seen increased political activity by citizens outside the established political parties with respect to local and environmental issues such as the location of stuttgart 21 , a railway hub , and construction of berlin brandenburg airport . [SEP]
[CLS] the 18th federal elections in germany resulted in the re - election of angela mer ##kel and her christian democratic parliamentary group of the parties cd ##u and cs ##u , receiving 41 . 5 % of all votes . [SEP]
[CLS] following mer ##kel ' s first two historically low results , her third campaign marked the cd ##u / cs ##u ' s best result since 1994 and only for the second time in german history the possibility of gaining an absolute majority . [SEP]
[CLS] their former coalition partner , the f ##dp , narrowly failed to reach the 5 % threshold and did not gain seats in the bun ##des ##tag . [SEP]
[CLS] not having reached an absolute majority , the cd ##u / cs ##u formed a grand coalition with the social - democratic spd after the longest coalition talks in history , making the head of the party sigma ##r gabriel vice - chancellor and federal minister for economic affairs and energy . [SEP]
[CLS] the only two opposition parties were the left ( 64 seats ) and alliance ' 90 / the greens ( 63 seats ) , which was acknowledged as creating a critical situation in which the opposition parties did not even have enough seats to use the special controlling powers of the opposition . [SEP]
[CLS] the two big parties , the conservative parliamentary group cd ##u / cs ##u and the social democrat spd were in a similar situation as in 2009 , after the last grand coalition had ended , and both had suffered severe losses ; reaching their second worst and worst result respectively in 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] many votes in the 2017 elections went to smaller parties , leading the right - wing pop ##uli ##st party af ##d ( alternative for germany ) into the bun ##des ##tag which marked a big shift in german politics since it was the first far - right party to win seats in parliament since the 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] coalition talks between the three " jamaican " parties were held but the final proposal was rejected by the liberals of the f ##dp , leaving the government in limb ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] following the unprecedented situation , for the first time in german history different minority coalition ##s or even direct snap coalition ##s were also heavily discussed . [SEP]
[CLS] at this point , federal president stein ##mei ##er invited leaders of all parties for talks about a government , being the first president in the history of the federal republic to do so . [SEP]
[CLS] official coalition talks between cd ##u / cs ##u and spd started in january 2018 and led to a renewal of the grand coalition on 12 march 2018 as well as the subsequent re - election of angela mer ##kel as chancellor . [SEP]
[CLS] the " basic law for the federal republic of germany " ( gr ##und ##ges ##etz der bun ##des ##re ##pu ##bl ##ik deutschland ) is the constitution of germany . [SEP]
[CLS] it was formally approved on 8 may 1949 , and , with the signature of the allies of world war ii on 12 may , came into effect on 23 may , as the constitution of those states of west germany that were initially included within the federal republic . [SEP]
[CLS] since 1990 , in the course of the reunification process after the fall of the berlin wall , the basic law also applies to the eastern states of the former german democratic republic . [SEP]
[CLS] as in germany ' s parliamentary system of government , the federal chancellor runs the government and day - to - day politics , the role of the federal president is mostly ceremonial . [SEP]
[CLS] nearly all actions of the federal president become valid only after a counters ##ign ##at ##ure of a government member . [SEP]
[CLS] the president is not obliged by constitution to refrain from political views . [SEP]
[CLS] he or she is expected to give direction to general political and societal debates , but not in a way that links him to party politics . [SEP]
[CLS] most german presidents were active politicians and party members prior to the office , which means that they have to change their political style when becoming president . [SEP]
[CLS] under article 59 ( 1 ) of the basic law , the federal president represents the federal republic of germany in matters of international law , concludes treaties with foreign states on its behalf and acc ##red ##its diplomats . [SEP]
[CLS] all federal laws must be signed by the president before they can come into effect ; he or she does not have a veto , but the conditions for refusing to sign a law on the basis of unconstitutional ##ity are the subject of debate . [SEP]
[CLS] the federal president does have a role in the political system , especially at the establishment of a new government and the dissolution of the bun ##des ##tag ( parliament ) . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , a federal president together with the federal council can support the government in a " legislator ##y emergency state " to enable laws against the will of the bun ##des ##tag ( article 81 of the basic law ) . [SEP]
[CLS] germany , like the united kingdom , can thus be classified as a parliamentary system . [SEP]
[CLS] the chancellor cannot be removed from office during a four - year term unless the " bun ##des ##tag " has agreed on a successor . [SEP]
[CLS] this constructive vote of no confidence is intended to avoid a similar situation to that of the weimar republic in which the executive did not have enough support in the legislature to govern effectively , but the legislature was too divided to name a successor . [SEP]
[CLS] except in the periods 1969 – 1972 and 1976 – 1982 , when the social democratic party of chancellor brandt and schmidt came in second in the elections , the chancellor has always been the candidate of the largest party , usually supported by a coalition of two parties with a majority in the parliament . [SEP]
[CLS] the chancellor appoint ##s one of the federal ministers as their deputy , who has the unofficial title vice chancellor . [SEP]
[CLS] the federal legislature has powers of exclusive jurisdiction and concurrent jurisdiction with the states in areas specified in the constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] the " bun ##des ##tag " is more powerful than the " bun ##des ##rat " and only needs the latter ' s consent for proposed legislation related to revenue shared by the federal and state governments , and the imp ##osition of responsibilities on the states . [SEP]
[CLS] in practice , however , the agreement of the " bun ##des ##rat " in the legislative process is often required , since federal legislation frequently has to be executed by state or local agencies . [SEP]
[CLS] parties that obtain fewer constituency seats than their national share of the vote are allotted seats from party lists to make up the difference . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , parties that obtain more constituency seats than their national share of the vote are allowed to keep these so - called over ##hang seats . [SEP]
[CLS] after bun ##des ##tag elections since 2013 , other parties obtain extra seats ( " balance seats " ) that offset advantages from their rival ' s over ##hang seats . [SEP]
[CLS] a party must receive either five percent of the national vote or win at least three directly elected seats to be eligible for non - constituency seats in the " bun ##des ##tag " . [SEP]
[CLS] this rule , often called the " five percent hurdle " , was incorporated into germany ' s election law to prevent political fragmentation and strong minor parties . [SEP]
[CLS] the main difference between the federal constitutional court and the federal court of justice is that the federal constitutional court may only be called if a constitutional matter within a case is in question ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] germany is a member of the nato defence alliance , the organisation of economic co - operation and development ( o ##ec ##d ) , the g ##8 , the g ##20 , the world bank and the international monetary fund ( im ##f ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the alliance was especially close in the late 1980s and early 1990s under the leadership of christian democrat helmut ko ##hl and socialist francois mit ##ter ##rand . [SEP]
[CLS] germany is at the forefront of european states seeking to advance the creation of a more unified european political , defence , and security apparatus . [SEP]
[CLS] for a number of decades after wwii , the federal republic of germany kept a notably low profile in international relations , because of both its recent history and its occupation by foreign powers . [SEP]
[CLS] the governments of germany and the united states are close political allies . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1948 marshall plan and strong cultural ties have crafted a strong bond between the two countries , although sc ##hr ##oder ' s very vocal opposition to the iraq war had suggested the end of atlantic ##ism and a relative cooling of german – american relations . [SEP]
[CLS] the two countries are also economically inter ##de ##pen ##dent : 5 . 0 % of german exports in goods are us - bound and 3 . 5 % of german imported goods originate from the us with a trade deficit of - 63 , 67 ##8 . 5 million dollars for the united states ( 2017 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] other signs of the close ties include the continuing position of german – americans as the largest reported ethnic group in the us , and the status of rams ##tein air base ( near kaiser ##sl ##au ##tern ) as the largest us military community outside the us . [SEP]
[CLS] it is formulated by the federal ministry for economic cooperation and development ( b ##m ##z ) and carried out by the implementing organisations . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the world ' s fourth biggest aid donor after the united states , the united kingdom and france . [SEP]
[CLS] due to differences in size and population , the subdivision of these states varies especially between city - states ( " st ##adt ##sta ##ate ##n " ) and states with larger territories ( " fl ##ache ##nl ##ander " ) . [SEP]
