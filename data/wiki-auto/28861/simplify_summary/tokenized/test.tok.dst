[CLS] the ser ##eng ##eti ecosystem is a geographical region in africa . [SEP]
[CLS] it is located in northern tanzania . [SEP]
[CLS] it spans approximately 3000 ##0 km ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the ser ##eng ##eti hosts the second largest terrestrial mammal migration in the world , which helps secure it as one of the seven natural wonders of africa , and as one of the ten natural travel wonders of the world . [SEP]
[CLS] the ser ##eng ##eti is also renowned for its large lion population and is one of the best places to observe pride ##s in their natural environment . [SEP]
[CLS] the region contains the ser ##eng ##eti national park in tanzania and several game reserves . [SEP]
[CLS] approximately 70 large mammal and 500 bird species are found there . [SEP]
[CLS] this high diversity is a function of diverse habitats , including river ##ine forests , swamps , ko ##p ##je ##s , grasslands , and woodlands . [SEP]
[CLS] blue wilde ##bee ##sts , gaze ##lles , zebra ##s , and buffalo ##s are some of the commonly found large mammals in the region . [SEP]
[CLS] there has been controversy about a proposal to build a road through the ser ##eng ##eti . [SEP]
[CLS] ser ##eng ##eti is derived from the ma ##asa ##i language , ma ##a ; specifically , " ser ##eng ##it " meaning " endless plains " . [SEP]
[CLS] much of the ser ##eng ##eti was known to outsiders as ma ##asa ##ila ##nd . [SEP]
[CLS] the ma ##asa ##i are known as fierce warriors and live alongside most wild animals with an ave ##rs ##ion to eating game and birds , sub ##sis ##ting exclusively on their cattle . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , their strength and reputation kept the newly arrived europeans from exploit ##ing the animals and resources of most of their land . [SEP]
[CLS] a ri ##nder ##pes ##t epidemic and drought during the 1890s greatly reduced the numbers of both ma ##asa ##i and animal populations . [SEP]
[CLS] the tanzania ##n government later in the 20th century re - settled the ma ##asa ##i around the ngo ##rong ##oro crater . [SEP]
[CLS] po ##achi ##ng and the absence of fires , which had been the result of human activity , set the stage for the development of dense woodlands and thick ##ets over the next 30 – 50 years . [SEP]
[CLS] ts ##ets ##e fly populations now prevented any significant human settlement in the area . [SEP]
[CLS] by the mid - 1970s , wilde ##bee ##st and the cape buffalo populations had recovered and were increasingly crop ##ping the grass , reducing the amount of fuel available for fires . [SEP]
[CLS] the reduced intensity of fires has allowed acacia to once again become established . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 21st century , mass ra ##bies va ##cci ##nation programmes for domestic dogs in the ser ##eng ##eti have not only indirectly prevented hundreds of human deaths , but also protected wildlife species such as the endangered african wild dog . [SEP]
[CLS] each year around the same time , the circular great wilde ##bee ##st migration begins in the ngo ##rong ##oro conservation area of the southern ser ##eng ##eti in tanzania and loops in a clockwise direction through the ser ##eng ##eti national park and north towards the mas ##ai mara reserve in kenya . [SEP]
[CLS] this migration is a natural phenomenon determined by the availability of grazing . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial phase lasts from approximately january to march , when the calvin ##g season begins – a time when there is plenty of rain - ripe ##ned grass available for the 260 , 000 zebra that pre ##cede 1 . 7 million wilde ##bee ##st and the following hundreds of thousands of other plains game , including around 470 , 000 gaze ##lles . [SEP]
[CLS] during february , the wilde ##bee ##st spend their time on the short grass plains of the southeastern part of the ecosystem , grazing and giving birth to approximately 500 , 000 calves within a 2 to 3 - week period . [SEP]
[CLS] few calves are born ahead of time and of these , hardly any survive . [SEP]
[CLS] the main reason is that very young calves are more noticeable to predators when mixed with older calves from the previous year . [SEP]
[CLS] as the rains end in may , the animals start moving northwest into the areas around the gr ##ume ##ti river , where they typically remain until late june . [SEP]
[CLS] the crossings of the gr ##ume ##ti and mara rivers beginning in july are a popular safari attraction because crocodile ##s are lying in wait . [SEP]
[CLS] the herds arrive in kenya in late july / august , where they stay for the remainder of the dry season , except that the thomson ' s and grant ' s gaze ##lles move only east / west . [SEP]
[CLS] in early november , with the start of the short rains the migration starts moving south again , to the short grass plains of the southeast , usually arriving in december in plenty of time for calvin ##g in february . [SEP]
[CLS] about 250 , 000 wilde ##bee ##st die during the journey from tanzania to the ma ##asa ##i mara national reserve in southwestern kenya , a total of 800 km . [SEP]
[CLS] death is usually from thirst , hunger , exhaustion , or pre ##dation . [SEP]
[CLS] the ser ##eng ##eti has some of east africa ' s finest game areas . [SEP]
[CLS] besides being known for the great migration , the ser ##eng ##eti is also famous for its abundant large predators . [SEP]
[CLS] the ecosystem is home to over 3 , 000 lions ( " panther ##a leo " ) , 1 , 000 leopard ##s ( " panther ##a par ##dus " ) , and 7 , 700 to 8 , 700 spotted h ##yen ##as ( " cr ##oc ##uta cr ##oc ##uta ) . " . [SEP]
[CLS] the east african che ##eta ##h are also present in ser ##eng ##eti . [SEP]
[CLS] wild dogs are relatively scarce in much of the ser ##eng ##eti . [SEP]
[CLS] this is particularly true in places such as ser ##eng ##eti national park ( where they became extinct in 1992 ) , in which lions and spotted h ##yen ##as , predators that steal wild dog kills and are a direct cause of wild dog mortality , are abundant . [SEP]
[CLS] the ser ##eng ##eti is also home to a diversity of graz ##ers , including african buffalo , war ##th ##og ##s , grant ' s gaze ##lle , el ##and , water ##buck , and top ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] the ser ##eng ##eti can support this remarkable variety of graz ##ers only because each species , even those that are closely related , has a different diet . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , wilde ##bee ##sts prefer to consume shorter grasses , while zebra ##s prefer taller ones . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , di ##k - di ##ks eat the lowest leaves of a tree , imp ##ala ##s eat the leaves that are higher up , and gi ##raf ##fe ##s eat leaves that are even higher . [SEP]
[CLS] the governments of tanzania and kenya maintain a number of protected areas , including national parks , conservation areas , and game reserves , that give legal protection to over 80 percent of the ser ##eng ##eti . [SEP]
[CLS] the southeastern area lies in the rain shadow of the ngo ##rong ##oro conservation area ' s highlands and is composed of short ##grass tree ##less plains with abundant small di ##cot ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] soils are high in nutrients , overly ##ing a shallow cal ##care ##ous hard ##pan due to nat ##ro ##carbon ##ati ##te eruptions from ol doin ##yo len ##gai . [SEP]
[CLS] a gradient of soil depth northwest ##ward across the plains results in changes in the herb ##aceous community and taller grass . [SEP]
[CLS] about 70 km west , acacia woodlands appear suddenly and stretch west to lake victoria and north to the lo ##ita plains , north of the ma ##asa ##i mara national reserve . [SEP]
[CLS] the sixteen acacia species vary over this range , their distribution determined by ed ##ap ##hic conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] near lake victoria , flood ##pl ##ains have developed from ancient lake ##bed ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in the far northwest , acacia woodlands are replaced by broad ##lea ##ved terminal ##ia - comb ##ret ##um woodlands , caused by a change in geology . [SEP]
[CLS] this area has the highest rainfall in the system and forms a refuge for the migrating un ##gul ##ates at the end of the dry season . [SEP]
[CLS] altitudes in the ser ##eng ##eti range from 92 ##0 to with mean temperatures varying from 15 to . [SEP]
[CLS] although the climate is usually warm and dry , rainfall occurs in two rainy seasons : march to may , and a shorter season in october and november . [SEP]
[CLS] rainfall amounts vary from a low of 50 ##8 mm in the lee of the ngo ##rong ##oro highlands to a high of 1200 mm on the shores of lake victoria . [SEP]
[CLS] the highlands , which are considerably cooler than the plains and are covered by montane forest , mark the eastern border of the basin in which the ser ##eng ##eti lies . [SEP]
[CLS] the ser ##eng ##eti plain is pun ##ctuated by granite and g ##ne ##iss out ##cr ##op ##ping ##s known as ko ##p ##je ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] these out ##cr ##op ##ping ##s are the result of volcanic activity . [SEP]
[CLS] ko ##p ##je ##s provide a micro ##hab ##ita ##t for non - plains wildlife . [SEP]
[CLS] one ko ##p ##je likely to be seen by visitors to the ser ##eng ##eti is the sim ##ba ko ##p ##je ( lion ko ##p ##je ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the area is also home to the ngo ##rong ##oro conservation area , which contains ngo ##rong ##oro crater and the old ##u ##va ##i gorge , where some of the oldest ho ##mini ##n fossils have been found . [SEP]
