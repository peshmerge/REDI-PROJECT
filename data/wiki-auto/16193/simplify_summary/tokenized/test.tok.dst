[CLS] jack roosevelt robinson ( january 31 , 1919 – october 24 , 1972 ) was an american professional baseball player who became the first african american to play in major league baseball ( mlb ) in the modern era . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson broke the baseball color line when he started at first base for the brooklyn dodgers on april 15 , 1947 . [SEP]
[CLS] when the dodgers signed robinson , they herald ##ed the end of racial segregation in professional baseball that had relegated black players to the negro leagues since the 1880s . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson was inducted into the baseball hall of fame in 1962 . [SEP]
[CLS] during his 10 - year mlb career , robinson won the inaugural rookie of the year award in 1947 , was an all - star for six consecutive seasons from 1949 through 1954 , and won the national league most valuable player award in 1949 — the first black player so honored . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson played in six world series and contributed to the dodgers ' 1955 world series championship . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1997 , mlb retired his uniform number 42 across all major league teams ; he was the first professional athlete in any sport to be so honored . [SEP]
[CLS] mlb also adopted a new annual tradition , " jackie robinson day " , for the first time on april 15 , 2004 , on which every player on every team wears no . 42 . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s character , his use of non ##vio ##lence , and his un ##quest ##ion ##able talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation that had then marked many other aspects of american life . [SEP]
[CLS] he influenced the culture of and contributed significantly to the civil rights movement . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson also was the first black television analyst in mlb and the first black vice president of a major american corporation , cho ##ck full o ' nuts . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1960s , he helped establish the freedom national bank , an african - american - owned financial institution based in harlem , new york . [SEP]
[CLS] after his death in 1972 , robinson was awarded the congressional gold medal and presidential medal of freedom in recognition of his achievements on and off the field . [SEP]
[CLS] jack roosevelt robinson was born on january 31 , 1919 , into a family of share ##cr ##op ##pers in cairo , georgia . [SEP]
[CLS] he was the youngest of five children born to mall ##ie ( mc ##gr ##iff ) and jerry robinson , after siblings edgar , frank , matthew ( nicknamed " mack " ) , and will ##a mae . [SEP]
[CLS] his middle name was in honor of former president theodore roosevelt , who died 25 days before robinson was born . [SEP]
[CLS] after robinson ' s father left the family in 1920 , they moved to pasadena , california . [SEP]
[CLS] the extended robinson family established itself on a residential plot containing two small houses at 121 pepper street in pasadena . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s mother worked various odd jobs to support the family . [SEP]
[CLS] growing up in relative poverty in an otherwise affluent community , robinson and his minority friends were excluded from many recreational opportunities . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , robinson joined a neighborhood gang , but his friend carl anderson persuaded him to abandon it . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1935 , robinson graduated from washington junior high school and enrolled at john muir high school ( muir tech ) . [SEP]
[CLS] recognizing his athletic talents , robinson ' s older brothers mack ( himself an accomplished athlete and silver medalist at the 1936 summer olympics ) and frank inspired jackie to pursue his interest in sports . [SEP]
[CLS] at muir tech , robinson played several sports at the varsity level and letter ##ed in four of them : football , basketball , track , and baseball . [SEP]
[CLS] he played shortstop and catcher on the baseball team , quarterback on the football team , and guard on the basketball team . [SEP]
[CLS] with the track and field squad , he won awards in the broad jump . [SEP]
[CLS] he was also a member of the tennis team . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1936 , robinson won the junior boys singles championship in the annual pacific coast negro tennis tournament and earned a place on the po ##mona annual baseball tournament all - star team , which included future hall of fame ##rs ted williams and bob lemon . [SEP]
[CLS] in late january 1937 , the " pasadena star - news " newspaper reported that robinson " for two years has been the outstanding athlete at muir , starring in football , basketball , track , baseball and tennis . " [SEP]
[CLS] after muir , robinson attended pasadena junior college ( p ##j ##c ) , where he continued his athletic career by participating in basketball , football , baseball , and track . [SEP]
[CLS] on the football team , he played quarterback and safety . [SEP]
[CLS] he was a shortstop and lead ##off hitter for the baseball team , and he broke school broad - jump records held by his brother mack . [SEP]
[CLS] as at muir high school , most of jackie ' s teammates were white . [SEP]
[CLS] while playing football at p ##j ##c , robinson suffered a fractured ankle , complications from which would eventually delay his deployment status while in the military . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1938 , he was elected to the all - southland junior college team for baseball and selected as the region ' s most valuable player . [SEP]
[CLS] that year , robinson was one of 10 students named to the school ' s order of the mast and dagger ( " om ##ic ##ron mu delta " ) , awarded to students performing " outstanding service to the school and whose scholastic and citizenship record is worthy of recognition . " [SEP]
[CLS] also while at p ##j ##c , he was elected to the lance ##rs , a student - run police organization responsible for patrolling various school activities . [SEP]
[CLS] an incident at p ##j ##c illustrated robinson ' s impatience with authority figures he perceived as racist — a character trait that would res ##ur ##face repeatedly in his life . [SEP]
[CLS] on january 25 , 1938 , he was arrested after vocal ##ly di ##sp ##uting the detention of a black friend by police . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson received a two - year suspended sentence , but the incident — along with other rumored run - ins between robinson and police — gave robinson a reputation for combat ##ive ##ness in the face of racial ant ##ago ##nism . [SEP]
[CLS] while at p ##j ##c , he was motivated by a preacher ( the rev . karl downs ) to attend church on a regular basis , and downs became a con ##fi ##dant for robinson , a christian . [SEP]
[CLS] toward the end of his p ##j ##c tenure , frank robinson ( to whom robinson felt closest among his three brothers ) was killed in a motorcycle accident . [SEP]
[CLS] the event motivated jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby university of california , los angeles ( ucla ) , where he could remain closer to frank ' s family . [SEP]
[CLS] after graduating from p ##j ##c in spring 1939 , robinson enrolled at ucla , where he became the school ' s first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports : baseball , basketball , football , and track . [SEP]
[CLS] he was one of four black players on the bruins ' 1939 football team ; the others were woody strode , kenny washington , and ray bartlett . [SEP]
[CLS] washington , strode , and robinson made up three of the team ' s four back ##field players . [SEP]
[CLS] at a time when only a few black students played mainstream college football , this made ucla college football ' s most integrated team . [SEP]
[CLS] they went undefeated with four ties at 6 – 0 – 4 . [SEP]
[CLS] in track and field , robinson won the 1940 ncaa championship in the long jump at 24 ft . [SEP]
[CLS] bel ##ying his future career , baseball was robinson ' s " worst sport " at ucla ; he hit . 09 ##7 in his only season , although in his first game he went 4 - for - 4 and twice stole home . [SEP]
[CLS] while a senior at ucla , robinson met his future wife , rachel is ##um ( b . 1922 ) , a ucla freshman who was familiar with robinson ' s athletic career at p ##j ##c . [SEP]
[CLS] he played football as a senior , but the 1940 bruins won only one game . [SEP]
[CLS] in the spring , robinson left college just shy of graduation , despite the reservations of his mother and is ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] he took a job as an assistant athletic director with the government ' s national youth administration ( ny ##a ) [SEP]
[CLS] after the government ceased ny ##a operations , robinson traveled to honolulu in the fall of 1941 to play football for the semi - professional , racial ##ly integrated honolulu after a short season , robinson returned to california in december 1941 to pursue a career as running back for the los angeles bulldogs of the pacific coast football league . [SEP]
[CLS] by that time , however , the japanese attack on pearl harbor had taken place , which drew the united states into world war ii and ended robinson ' s nas ##cent football career . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1942 , robinson was drafted and assigned to a segregated army cavalry unit in fort riley , kansas . [SEP]
[CLS] having the re ##quisite qualifications , robinson and several other black soldiers applied for admission to an officer candidate school ( o ##cs ) then located at fort riley . [SEP]
[CLS] although the army ' s initial july 1941 guidelines for o ##cs had been drafted as race neutral , few black applicants were admitted into o ##cs until after subsequent directive ##s by army leadership . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , the applications of robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months . [SEP]
[CLS] after protests by heavyweight boxing champion joe louis ( then stationed at fort riley ) and the help of truman gibson ( then an assistant civilian aide to the secretary of war ) , the men were accepted into o ##cs . [SEP]
[CLS] the experience led to a personal friendship between robinson and louis . [SEP]
[CLS] upon finishing o ##cs , robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in january 1943 . [SEP]
[CLS] shortly afterward , robinson and is ##um were formally engaged . [SEP]
[CLS] after receiving his commission , robinson was reassigned to fort hood , texas , where he joined the 76 ##1 ##st " black panthers " tank battalion . [SEP]
[CLS] while at fort hood , robinson often used his weekend leave to visit the rev . karl downs , president of sam hu ##ston college ( now hu ##ston - till ##ots ##on university ) in nearby austin , texas ; downs had been robinson ' s pastor at scott united methodist church while robinson attended p ##j ##c . [SEP]
[CLS] an event on july 6 , 1944 der ##ailed robinson ' s military career . [SEP]
[CLS] while awaiting results of hospital tests on the ankle he had injured in junior college , robinson boarded an army bus with a fellow officer ' s wife ; although the army had commissioned its own un ##se ##gre ##gated bus line , the bus driver ordered robinson to move to the back of the bus . [SEP]
[CLS] the driver backed down , but after reaching the end of the line , summoned the military police , who took robinson into custody . [SEP]
[CLS] when robinson later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant , the officer recommended robinson be court - martial ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] after robinson ' s commander in the 76 ##1 ##st , paul l . bates , refused to author ##ize the legal action , robinson was sum ##mar ##ily transferred to the 75 ##8th battalion — where the commander quickly consent ##ed to charge robinson with multiple offenses , including , among other charges , public drunken ##ness , even though robinson did not drink . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time of the court - martial in august 1944 , the charges against robinson had been reduced to two counts of ins ##ub ##ord ##ination during questioning . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson was acquitted by an all - white panel of nine officers . [SEP]
[CLS] the experiences robinson was subjected to during the court proceedings would be remembered when he later joined mlb and was subjected to racist attacks . [SEP]
[CLS] although his former unit , the 76 ##1 ##st tank battalion , became the first black tank unit to see combat in world war ii , robinson ' s court - martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas ; thus , he never saw combat action . [SEP]
[CLS] after his ac ##qui ##ttal , he was transferred to camp br ##eck ##in ##ridge , kentucky , where he served as a coach for army athletics until receiving an honorable discharge in november 1944 . [SEP]
[CLS] while there , robinson met a former player for the kansas city monarchs of the negro american league , who encouraged robinson to write the monarchs and ask for a try ##out . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson took the former player ' s advice and wrote to monarchs ' co - owner thomas baird . [SEP]
[CLS] after his discharge , robinson briefly returned to his old football club , the los angeles bulldogs . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor rev . karl downs to be the athletic director at samuel hu ##ston college in austin , then of the southwestern athletic conference . [SEP]
[CLS] the job included coaching the school ' s basketball team for the 1944 – 45 season . [SEP]
[CLS] as it was a fledgling program , few students tried out for the basketball team , and robinson even resort ##ed to insert ##ing himself into the lineup for exhibition games . [SEP]
[CLS] although his teams were out ##mat ##ched by opponents , robinson was respected as a disc ##ip ##lina ##rian coach , and drew the admiration of , among others , lang ##ston university basketball player mar ##ques haynes , a future member of the harlem globe ##tro ##tters . [SEP]
[CLS] in early 1945 , while robinson was at sam hu ##ston college , the kansas city monarchs sent him a written offer to play professional baseball in the negro leagues . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson accepted a contract for $ 400 per month . [SEP]
[CLS] although he played well for the monarchs , robinson was frustrated with the experience . [SEP]
[CLS] he had grown used to a structured playing environment in college , and the negro leagues ' di ##sor ##gan ##ization and embrace of gambling interests appalled him . [SEP]
[CLS] the he ##ctic travel schedule also placed a burden on his relationship with is ##um , with whom he could now communicate only by letter . [SEP]
[CLS] in all , robinson played 47 games at shortstop for the monarchs , hitting . 38 ##7 with five home runs , and registering 13 stolen bases . [SEP]
[CLS] he also appeared in the 1945 east – west all - star game , going hit ##less in five at - bats . [SEP]
[CLS] during the season , robinson pursued potential major league interests . [SEP]
[CLS] no black man had played in the major leagues since moses fleetwood walker in 1884 , but the boston red sox nevertheless held a try ##out at fen ##way park for robinson and other black players on april 16 . [SEP]
[CLS] the try ##out , however , was a far ##ce chiefly designed to ass ##ua ##ge the des ##eg ##re ##gation ##ist sen ##si ##bilities of powerful boston city council ##man isa ##dor ##e h . y . much ##nick . [SEP]
[CLS] even with the stands limited to management , robinson was subjected to racial epithet ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] he left the try ##out humiliated , and more than fourteen years later , in july 1959 , the red sox became the last major league team to integrate its roster . [SEP]
[CLS] other teams , however , had more serious interest in signing a black ball ##play ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] in the mid - 1940s , branch rick ##ey , club president and general manager of the brooklyn dodgers , began to scout the negro leagues for a possible addition to the dodgers ' roster . [SEP]
[CLS] rick ##ey selected robinson from a list of promising black players and interviewed him for possible assignment to brooklyn ' s international league farm club , the montreal royals . [SEP]
[CLS] rick ##ey was especially interested in making sure his eventual sign ##ee could withstand the inevitable racial abuse that would be directed at him . [SEP]
[CLS] in a famous three - hour exchange on august 28 , 1945 , rick ##ey asked robinson if he could face the racial an ##imus without taking the bait and reacting angrily — a concern given robinson ' s prior arguments with law enforcement officials at p ##j ##c and in the military . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson was ag ##has ##t : " are you looking for a negro who is afraid to fight back ? " [SEP]
[CLS] rick ##ey replied that he needed a negro player " with guts enough not to fight back . " [SEP]
[CLS] after obtaining a commitment from robinson to " turn the other cheek " to racial ant ##ago ##nism , rick ##ey agreed to sign him to a contract for $ 600 a month , equal to $ today . [SEP]
[CLS] rick ##ey did not offer compensation to the monarchs , instead believing all negro league players were free agents due to the contracts not containing a reserve clause . [SEP]
[CLS] among those rick ##ey discussed prospects with was wendell smith , writer for the black weekly " pittsburgh courier " , who according to cleveland indians owner and team president bill ve ##eck " influenced rick ##ey to take jack robinson , for which he ' s never completely gotten credit . " [SEP]
[CLS] although he required robinson to keep the arrangement a secret for the time being , rick ##ey committed to formally signing robinson before november 1 , 1945 . [SEP]
[CLS] on october 23 , it was publicly announced that robinson would be assigned to the royals for the 1946 season . [SEP]
[CLS] on the same day , with representatives of the royals and dodgers present , robinson formally signed his contract with the royals . [SEP]
[CLS] in what was later referred to as " the noble experiment " , robinson was the first black baseball player in the international league since the 1880s . [SEP]
[CLS] he was not necessarily the best player in the negro leagues , and black talents sat ##chel paige and josh gibson were upset when robinson was selected first . [SEP]
[CLS] larry do ##by , who broke the color line in the american league the same year as robinson , said , " one of the things that was disappointing and dish ##ear ##ten ##ing to a lot of the black players at the time was that jack was not the best player . [SEP]
[CLS] the best was josh gibson . [SEP]
[CLS] i think that ' s one of the reasons why josh died so early — he was heart ##broken . " [SEP]
[CLS] rick ##ey ' s offer allowed robinson to leave behind the monarchs and their gr ##uel ##ing bus rides , and he went home to pasadena . [SEP]
[CLS] that september , he signed with chet brewer ' s kansas city royals , a post - season barns ##torm ##ing team in the california winter league . [SEP]
[CLS] later that off - season , he briefly toured south america with another barns ##torm ##ing team , while his fiancee is ##um pursued nursing opportunities in new york city . [SEP]
[CLS] on february 10 , 1946 , robinson and is ##um were married by their old friend , the rev . karl downs . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1946 , robinson arrived at daytona beach , florida , for spring training with the montreal royals of the class aaa international league ( the designation of " aaa " for the highest level of minor league baseball was first used in the 1946 season ) . [SEP]
[CLS] clay hopper , the manager of the royals , asked rick ##ey to assign robinson to any other dodge ##r affiliate , but rick ##ey refused . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s presence was controversial in racial ##ly charged florida . [SEP]
[CLS] he was not allowed to stay with his white teammates at the team hotel , and instead lodged at the home of joe and duff ##erin harris , a politically active african - american couple who introduced the robinson ##s to mary mcleod beth ##une . [SEP]
[CLS] since the dodgers organization did not own a spring training facility ( the dodge ##r - controlled spring training compound in ve ##ro beach known as " dodge ##rt ##own " did not open until spring 1948 ) , scheduling was subject to the w ##him of area localities , several of which turned down any event involving robinson or johnny wright , another black player whom rick ##ey had signed to the dodgers ' organization in january . [SEP]
[CLS] in sanford , florida , the police chief threatened to cancel games if robinson and wright did not cease training activities there ; as a result , robinson was sent back to daytona beach . [SEP]
[CLS] in jacksonville , the stadium was pad ##lock ##ed shut without warning on game day , by order of the city ' s parks and public property director . [SEP]
[CLS] in del ##and , a scheduled day game was postponed , ostensibly because of issues with the stadium ' s electrical lighting . [SEP]
[CLS] after much lobbying of local officials by rick ##ey himself , the royals were allowed to host a game involving robinson in daytona beach . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson made his royals debut at daytona beach ' s city island ball ##park on march 17 , 1946 , in an exhibition game against the team ' s parent club , the dodgers . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson thus became the first black player to openly play for a minor league team against a major league team since the " de facto " baseball color line had been implemented in the 1880s . [SEP]
[CLS] later in spring training , after some less - than - stellar performances , robinson was shifted from shortstop to second base , allowing him to make shorter throws to first base . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s performance soon rebound ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] on april 18 , 1946 , roosevelt stadium hosted the jersey city giants ' season opener against the montreal royals , marking the professional debut of the royals ' jackie robinson and the first time the color barrier had been broken in a game between two minor league clubs . [SEP]
[CLS] pitching against robinson was warren sand ##el who had played against him when they both lived in california . [SEP]
[CLS] during robinson ' s first at bat , the jersey city catcher , dick bo ##uk ##night , demanded that sand ##el throw at robinson , but sand ##el refused . [SEP]
[CLS] although sand ##el induced robinson to ground out at his first at bat , robinson ended up with four hits in his five trips to the plate ; his first hit was a three - run home run in the game ' s third inning . [SEP]
[CLS] he also scored four runs , drove in three , and stole two bases in the royals ' 14 – 1 victory . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson proceeded to lead the international league that season with a . 34 ##9 batting average and . 98 ##5 fielding percentage , and he was named the league ' s most valuable player . [SEP]
[CLS] although he often faced hostility while on road trips ( the royals were forced to cancel a southern exhibition tour , for example ) , the montreal fan base enthusiastically supported robinson . [SEP]
[CLS] whether fans supported or opposed it , robinson ' s presence on the field was a boon to attendance ; more than one million people went to games involving robinson in 1946 , an amazing figure by international league standards . [SEP]
[CLS] in the fall of 1946 , following the baseball season , robinson returned home to california and briefly played professional basketball for the short - lived los angeles red devils . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1947 , the dodgers called robinson up to the major leagues six days before the start of the season . [SEP]
[CLS] with eddie stan ##ky en ##tre ##nched at second base for the dodgers , robinson played his initial major league season as a first baseman . [SEP]
[CLS] on april 15 , robinson made his major league debut at the relatively advanced age of 28 at e ##bbe ##ts field before a crowd of 26 , 62 ##3 spectators , more than 14 , 000 of whom were black . [SEP]
[CLS] although he failed to get a base hit , he walked and scored a run in the dodgers ' 5 – 3 victory . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson became the first player since 1884 to openly break the major league baseball color line . [SEP]
[CLS] black fans began flock ##ing to see the dodgers when they came to town , abandoning their negro league teams . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s promotion met a generally positive , although mixed , reception among newspapers and white major league players . [SEP]
[CLS] however , racial tension existed in the dodge ##r clubhouse . [SEP]
[CLS] some dodge ##r players ins ##in ##uated they would sit out rather than play alongside robinson . [SEP]
[CLS] the brewing mutiny ended when dodgers management took a stand for robinson . [SEP]
[CLS] manager leo du ##ro ##cher informed the team , " i do not care if the guy is yellow or black , or if he has stripes like a fuck ##in ' zebra . [SEP]
[CLS] i ' m the manager of this team , and i say he plays . [SEP]
[CLS] what ' s more , i say he can make us all rich . [SEP]
[CLS] and if any of you cannot use the money , i will see that you are all traded . " [SEP]
[CLS] robinson was also der ##ided by opposing teams . [SEP]
[CLS] according to a press report , the st . louis cardinals threatened to strike if robinson played and to spread the walk ##out across the entire national league . [SEP]
[CLS] existence of the plot was said to have been leaked by the cardinals ' team physician , robert h ##yla ##nd , to a friend , the " new york herald tribune " ' s rutherford " ru ##d " ren ##nie . [SEP]
[CLS] the reporter , concerned about protecting h ##yla ##nd ' s an ##ony ##mity and job , in turn leaked it to his " tribune " colleague and editor , stanley woodward , whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected h ##yla ##nd . [SEP]
[CLS] the woodward article made national headlines . [SEP]
[CLS] after it was published , national league president ford fr ##ick and baseball commissioner happy chandler let it be known that any striking players would be suspended . [SEP]
[CLS] " you will find that the friends that you think you have in the press box will not support you , that you will be out ##cast ##s , " fr ##ick was quoted as saying . [SEP]
[CLS] " i do not care if half the league strikes . [SEP]
[CLS] those who do it will encounter quick retribution . [SEP]
[CLS] all will be suspended and i don ' t care if it wreck ##s the national league for five years . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the united states of america and one citizen has as much right to play as another . " [SEP]
[CLS] woodward ' s article received the e . p . dutton award in 1947 for best sports reporting . [SEP]
[CLS] the cardinals players denied that they were planning to strike , and woodward later told author roger kahn that fr ##ick was his true source ; writer warren corbett said that fr ##ick ' s speech " never happened " . [SEP]
[CLS] regardless , the report led to robinson receiving increased support from the sports media . [SEP]
[CLS] even " the sporting news " , a publication that had backed the color line , came out against the idea of a strike . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson nonetheless became the target of rough physical play by opponents ( particularly the cardinals ) . [SEP]
[CLS] at one time , he received a seven - inch gas ##h in his leg from en ##os slaughter . [SEP]
[CLS] on april 22 , 1947 , during a game between the dodgers and the philadelphia phillies , phillies players and manager ben chapman called robinson a " ni ##gger " from their dug ##out and yelled that he should " go back to the cotton fields " . [SEP]
[CLS] rick ##ey later recalled that chapman " did more than anybody to unite the dodgers . [SEP]
[CLS] when he poured out that string of un ##con ##sc ##ion ##able abuse , he solid ##ified and united thirty men . " [SEP]
[CLS] robinson did , however , receive significant encouragement from several major league players . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson named lee " jeep " handle ##y , who played for the phillies at the time , as the first opposing player to wish him well . [SEP]
[CLS] dodgers teammate pee wee reese once came to robinson ' s defense with the famous line , " you can hate a man for many reasons . [SEP]
[CLS] color is not one of them . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1947 or 1948 , reese is said to have put his arm around robinson in response to fans who shouted racial sl ##urs at robinson before a game in boston or cincinnati . [SEP]
[CLS] a statue by sculptor william be ##hre ##nds , unveiled at keys ##pan park on november 1 , 2005 , depicts reese with his arm around robinson . [SEP]
[CLS] jewish baseball star hank greenberg , who had to deal with ethnic epithet ##s during his career , also encouraged robinson . [SEP]
[CLS] following an incident where greenberg collided with robinson at first base , he " whispered a few words into robinson ' s ear " , which robinson later characterized as " words of encouragement . " [SEP]
[CLS] greenberg had advised him to overcome his critics by defeating them in games . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson also talked frequently with larry do ##by , who endured his own hardship ##s since becoming the first black player in the american league with the cleveland indians , as the two spoke to one another via telephone throughout the season . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson finished the season having played in 151 games for the dodgers , with a batting average of . 297 , an on - base percentage of . 38 ##3 , and a . 42 ##7 slug ##ging percentage . [SEP]
[CLS] he had 175 hits ( scoring 125 runs ) including 31 doubles , 5 triple ##s , and 12 home runs , driving in 48 runs for the year . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson led the league in sacrifice hits , with 28 , and in stolen bases , with 29 . [SEP]
[CLS] his cumulative performance earned him the inaugural major league baseball rookie of the year award ( separate national and american league rookie of the year honors were not awarded until 1949 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] following stan ##ky ' s trade to the boston braves in march 1948 , robinson took over second base , where he logged a . 980 fielding percentage that year ( second in the national league at the position , fraction ##ally behind stan ##ky ) . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson had a batting average of . 296 and 22 stolen bases for the season . [SEP]
[CLS] in a 12 – 7 win against the st . louis cardinals on august 29 , 1948 , he hit for the cycle — a home run , a triple , a double , and a single in the same game . [SEP]
[CLS] the dodgers briefly moved into first place in the national league in late august 1948 , but they ultimately finished third as the braves went on to win the league title and lose to the cleveland indians in the world series . [SEP]
[CLS] racial pressure on robinson eased in 1948 when a number of other black players entered the major leagues . [SEP]
[CLS] larry do ##by ( who broke the color barrier in the american league on july 5 , 1947 , just 11 weeks after robinson ) and sat ##chel paige played for the cleveland indians , and the dodgers had three other black players besides robinson . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 1948 , he signed a $ 12 , 500 contract ( equal to $ today ) with the dodgers ; while a significant amount , this was less than robinson made in the off - season from a vaudeville tour , where he answered pre - set baseball questions and a speaking tour of the south . [SEP]
[CLS] between the tours , he underwent surgery on his right ankle . [SEP]
[CLS] because of his off - season activities , robinson reported to training camp 30 lb over ##weight . [SEP]
[CLS] he lost the weight during training camp , but diet ##ing left him weak at the plate . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1948 , wendell smith ' s book , " jackie robinson : my own story " , was released . [SEP]
[CLS] in the spring of 1949 , robinson turned to hall of fame ##r george sis ##ler , working as an advisor to the dodgers , for batting help . [SEP]
[CLS] at sis ##ler ' s suggestion , robinson spent hours at a batting tee , learning to hit the ball to right field . [SEP]
[CLS] sis ##ler taught robinson to anti ##ci ##pate a fast ##ball , on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curve ##ball . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson also noted that " sis ##ler showed me how to stop lung ##ing , how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second " . [SEP]
[CLS] the tu ##tel ##age helped robinson raise his batting average from . 296 in 1948 to . 34 ##2 in 1949 . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to his improved batting average , robinson stole 37 bases that season , was second place in the league for both doubles and triple ##s , and registered 124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored . [SEP]
[CLS] for the performance robinson earned the most valuable player award for the national league . [SEP]
[CLS] baseball fans also voted robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 all - star game — the first all - star game to include black players . [SEP]
[CLS] that year , a song about robinson by buddy johnson , " did you see jackie robinson hit that ball ? " , [SEP]
[CLS] , reached number 13 on the charts ; count bas ##ie recorded a famous version . [SEP]
[CLS] ultimately , the dodgers won the national league pennant , but lost in five games to the new york yankees in the 1949 world series . [SEP]
[CLS] summer 1949 brought an unwanted distraction for robinson . [SEP]
[CLS] in july , he was called to testify before the united states house of representatives ' committee on un - american activities ( hua ##c ) concerning statements made that april by black athlete and actor paul robes ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson was reluctant to testify , but he eventually agreed to do so , fearing it might negatively affect his career if he declined . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1950 , robinson led the national league in double plays made by a second baseman with 133 . [SEP]
[CLS] his salary that year was the highest any dodge ##r had been paid to that point : $ 35 , 000 ( $ in dollars ) . [SEP]
[CLS] he finished the year with 99 runs scored , a . 328 batting average , and 12 stolen bases . [SEP]
[CLS] the year saw the release of a film biography of robinson ' s life , " the jackie robinson story " , in which robinson played himself , and actress ruby dee played ra ##cha ##el " rae " ( is ##um ) robinson . [SEP]
[CLS] the project had been previously delayed when the film ' s producers refused to acc ##ede to demands of two hollywood studios that the movie include scenes of robinson being tutor ##ed in baseball by a white man . [SEP]
[CLS] " the new york times " wrote that robinson , " doing that rare thing of playing himself in the picture ' s leading role , displays a calm assurance and composure that might be en ##vie ##d by many a hollywood star . " [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s hollywood exploits , however , did not sit well with dodgers co - owner walter o ' malley , who referred to robinson as " rick ##ey ' s prima donna " . [SEP]
[CLS] in late 1950 , rick ##ey ' s contract as the dodgers ' team president expired . [SEP]
[CLS] weary of constant disagreements with o ' malley , and with no hope of being re - appointed as president of the dodgers , rick ##ey cash ##ed out his one - quarter financial interest in the team , leaving o ' malley in full control of the franchise . [SEP]
[CLS] rick ##ey shortly thereafter became general manager of the pittsburgh pirates . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to rick ##ey , whom he considered a father figure , stating , " regardless of what happens to me in the future , it all can be placed on what you have done and , believe me , i appreciate it . " [SEP]
[CLS] before the 1951 season , o ' malley reportedly offered robinson the job of manager of the montreal royals , effective at the end of robinson ' s playing career . [SEP]
[CLS] o ' malley was quoted in the " montreal standard " as saying , " jackie told me that he would be both delighted and honored to tackle this managerial post " — although reports differed as to whether a position was ever formally offered . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1951 season , robinson led the national league in double plays made by a second baseman for the second year in a row , with 137 . [SEP]
[CLS] he also kept the dodgers in contention for the 1951 pennant . [SEP]
[CLS] during the last game of the regular season , in the 13th inning , he had a hit to tie the game and then hit a home run in the 14th inning , which proved to be the winning margin . [SEP]
[CLS] this forced a best - of - three playoff series against the cross ##town rival new york giants . [SEP]
[CLS] despite robinson ' s regular - season heroic ##s , on october 3 , 1951 , the dodgers lost the pennant on bobby thomson ' s famous home run , known as the shot heard ' round the world . [SEP]
[CLS] overcoming his de ##ject ##ion , robinson du ##ti ##fully observed thomson ' s feet to ensure he touched all the bases . [SEP]
[CLS] dodgers sports ##caster vin scully later noted that the incident showed " how much of a competitor robinson was . " [SEP]
[CLS] he finished the season with 106 runs scored , a batting average of . 335 , and 25 stolen bases . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson had what was an average year for him in 1952 . [SEP]
[CLS] he finished the year with 104 runs , a . 308 batting average , and 24 stolen bases . [SEP]
[CLS] he did , however , record a career - high on - base percentage of . 43 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] the dodgers improved on their performance from the year before , winning the national league pennant before losing the 1952 world series to the new york yankees in seven games . [SEP]
[CLS] that year , on the television show " youth wants to know " , robinson challenged the yankees ' general manager , george weiss , on the racial record of his team , which had yet to sign a black player . [SEP]
[CLS] sports ##writer dick young , whom robinson had described as a " big ##ot " , said , " if there was one flaw in jackie , it was the common one . [SEP]
[CLS] he believed that everything unpleasant that happened to him happened because of his blackness . " [SEP]
[CLS] the 1952 season was the last year robinson was an everyday starter at second base . [SEP]
[CLS] afterward , robinson played variously at first , second , and third bases , shortstop , and in the out ##field , with jim gill ##iam , another black player , taking over everyday second base duties . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s interests began to shift toward the prospect of managing a major league team . [SEP]
[CLS] he had hoped to gain experience by managing in the puerto rican winter league , but according to the " new york post " , commissioner happy chandler denied the request . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1953 , robinson had 109 runs , a . 329 batting average , and 17 steals , leading the dodgers to another national league pennant ( and another world series loss to the yankees , this time in six games ) . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s continued success spawned a string of death threats . [SEP]
[CLS] he was not di ##ss ##ua ##ded , however , from addressing racial issues publicly . [SEP]
[CLS] that year , he served as editor for " our sports " magazine , a periodical focusing on negro sports issues ; contributions to the magazine included an article on golf course segregation by robinson ' s old friend joe louis . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson also openly criticized segregated hotels and restaurants that served the dodge ##r organization ; a number of these establishments integrated as a result , including the five - star chase park hotel in st . louis . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1954 , robinson had 62 runs scored , a . 311 batting average , and 7 steals . [SEP]
[CLS] his best day at the plate was on june 17 , when he hit two home runs and two doubles . [SEP]
[CLS] the following autumn , robinson won his only championship when the dodgers beat the new york yankees in the 1955 world series . [SEP]
[CLS] although the team enjoyed ultimate success , 1955 was the worst year of robinson ' s individual career . [SEP]
[CLS] he hit . 256 and stole only 12 bases . [SEP]
[CLS] the dodgers tried robinson in the out ##field and as a third baseman , both because of his dim ##ini ##shing abilities and because gill ##iam was established at second base . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson , then 37 years old , missed 49 games and did not play in game 7 of the world series . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson missed the game because manager walter als ##ton decided to play gill ##iam at second and don ho ##ak at third base . [SEP]
[CLS] that season , the dodgers ' don new ##combe became the first black major league pitcher to win twenty games in a year . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1956 , robinson had 61 runs scored , a . 275 batting average , and 12 steals . [SEP]
[CLS] by then , he had begun to exhibit the effects of diabetes and to lose interest in the prospect of playing or managing professional baseball . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ended his major league career when he struck out to end game 7 of the 1956 world series . [SEP]
[CLS] after the season , the dodgers traded robinson to the arch - rival new york giants for dick little ##field and $ 35 , 000 cash ( equal to $ today ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the trade , however , was never completed ; un ##bek ##now ##nst to the dodgers , robinson had already agreed with the president of cho ##ck full o ' nuts to quit baseball and become an executive with the company . [SEP]
[CLS] since robinson had sold exclusive rights to any retirement story to " look " magazine two years previously , his retirement decision was revealed through the magazine , instead of through the dodgers organization . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s major league debut brought an end to approximately sixty years of segregation in professional baseball , known as the baseball color line . [SEP]
[CLS] after world war ii , several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks , including their accelerated migration to the north , where their political cl ##out grew , and president harry truman ' s des ##eg ##re ##gation of the military in 1948 . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbol ##ized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter . [SEP]
[CLS] martin luther king , jr . said that he was " a legend and a symbol in his own time " , and that he " challenged the dark skies of into ##ler ##ance and frustration . " [SEP]
[CLS] according to historian doris ke ##arns goodwin , robinson ' s " efforts were a monumental step in the civil - rights revolution in america . . . his accomplishments allowed black and white americans to be more respectful and open to one another and more app ##re ##cia ##tive of everyone ' s abilities . " [SEP]
[CLS] beginning his major league career at the relatively advanced age of twenty - eight , he played only ten seasons from 1947 to 1956 , all of them for the brooklyn dodgers . [SEP]
[CLS] during his career , the dodgers played in six world series , and robinson himself played in six all - star games . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1999 , he was posthumously named to the major league baseball all - century team . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s career is generally considered to mark the beginning of the post – " long ball " era in baseball , in which a reliance on raw power - hitting gave way to balanced offensive strategies that used foot ##sp ##eed to create runs through aggressive base ##run ##ning . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson exhibited the combination of hitting ability and speed which exemplified the new era . [SEP]
[CLS] he scored more than 100 runs in six of his ten seasons ( averaging more than 110 runs from 1947 to 1953 ) , had a . 311 career batting average , a . 40 ##9 career on - base percentage , a . 47 ##4 slug ##ging percentage , and substantially more walks than strikeouts ( 740 to 291 ) . [SEP]

[CLS] he accumulated 197 stolen bases in total , including 19 steals of home . [SEP]
[CLS] none of the latter were double steals ( in which a player stealing home is assisted by a player stealing another base at the same time ) . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson has been referred to by author david fa ##lk ##ner as " the father of modern base - stealing " . [SEP]

[CLS] assessing himself , robinson said , " i ' m not concerned with your liking or di ##sl ##iki ##ng me . . . all i ask is that you respect me as a human being . " [SEP]
[CLS] regarding robinson ' s qualities on the field , leo du ##ro ##cher said , " ya want a guy that comes to play . [SEP]
[CLS] this guy didn ' t just come to play . [SEP]
[CLS] he come to beat ya . [SEP]
[CLS] he come to stuff the goddamn bat right up your ass . " [SEP]
[CLS] robinson portrayed himself in the 1950 motion picture " the jackie robinson story " . [SEP]

[CLS] he identified himself as a political independent , although he held conservative opinions on several issues , including the vietnam war ( he once wrote to martin luther king , jr . to defend the johnson administration ' s military policy ) . [SEP]
[CLS] after supporting richard nixon in his 1960 presidential race against john f . kennedy , robinson later praised kennedy e ##ff ##us ##ively for his stance on civil rights . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson was angered by conservative republican opposition to the civil rights act of 1964 , though a higher percentage of democrats voted against it in both the house and senate . [SEP]
[CLS] he became one of six national directors for nelson rockefeller ' s unsuccessful campaign to be nominated as the republican candidate for the 1964 presidential election . [SEP]
[CLS] after the party nominated senator barry gold ##water of arizona instead , robinson left the party ' s convention commenting that he now had " a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a jew in hitler ' s germany " . [SEP]

[CLS] this wish was only fulfilled after robinson ' s death : following the 1974 season , the cleveland indians gave their managerial post to frank robinson ( no relation to jackie ) , a hall of fame - bound player who would go on to manage three other teams . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the success of these two robinson ##s and other black players , the number of african - american players in major league baseball has declined since the 1970s . [SEP]
