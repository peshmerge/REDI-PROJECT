[CLS] jack roosevelt robinson ( january 31 , 1919 – october 24 , 1972 ) was an american professional baseball player who became the first african american to play in major league baseball ( mlb ) in the modern era . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson broke the baseball color line when he started at first base for the brooklyn dodgers on april 15 , 1947 . [SEP]
[CLS] when the dodgers signed robinson , they herald ##ed the end of racial segregation in professional baseball that had relegated black players to the negro leagues since the 1880s . [SEP]
[CLS] during his 10 - year mlb career , robinson won the inaugural rookie of the year award in 1947 , was an all - star for six consecutive seasons from 1949 through 1954 , and won the national league most valuable player award in 1949 — the first black player so honored . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson played in six world series and contributed to the dodgers ' 1955 world series championship . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1997 , mlb retired his uniform number 42 across all major league teams ; he was the first professional athlete in any sport to be so honored . [SEP]
[CLS] mlb also adopted a new annual tradition , " jackie robinson day " , for the first time on april 15 , 2004 , on which every player on every team wears no . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s character , his use of non ##vio ##lence , and his un ##quest ##ion ##able talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation that had then marked many other aspects of american life . [SEP]
[CLS] after his death in 1972 , robinson was awarded the congressional gold medal and presidential medal of freedom in recognition of his achievements on and off the field . [SEP]
[CLS] he was the youngest of five children born to mall ##ie ( mc ##gr ##iff ) and jerry robinson , after siblings edgar , frank , matthew ( nicknamed " mack " ) , and will ##a mae . [SEP]
[CLS] his middle name was in honor of former president theodore roosevelt , who died 25 days before robinson was born . [SEP]
[CLS] recognizing his athletic talents , robinson ' s older brothers mack ( himself an accomplished athlete and silver medalist at the 1936 summer olympics ) and frank inspired jackie to pursue his interest in sports . [SEP]
[CLS] he played shortstop and catcher on the baseball team , quarterback on the football team , and guard on the basketball team . [SEP]
[CLS] in late january 1937 , the " pasadena star - news " newspaper reported that robinson " for two years has been the outstanding athlete at muir , starring in football , basketball , track , baseball and tennis . " [SEP]
[CLS] that year , robinson was one of 10 students named to the school ' s order of the mast and dagger ( " om ##ic ##ron mu delta " ) , awarded to students performing " outstanding service to the school and whose scholastic and citizenship record is worthy of recognition . " [SEP]
[CLS] on january 25 , 1938 , he was arrested after vocal ##ly di ##sp ##uting the detention of a black friend by police . [SEP]
[CLS] toward the end of his p ##j ##c tenure , frank robinson ( to whom robinson felt closest among his three brothers ) was killed in a motorcycle accident . [SEP]
[CLS] the event motivated jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby university of california , los angeles ( ucla ) , where he could remain closer to frank ' s family . [SEP]
[CLS] after graduating from p ##j ##c in spring 1939 , robinson enrolled at ucla , where he became the school ' s first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports : baseball , basketball , football , and track . [SEP]
[CLS] he was one of four black players on the bruins ' 1939 football team ; the others were woody strode , kenny washington , and ray bartlett . [SEP]
[CLS] washington , strode , and robinson made up three of the team ' s four back ##field players . [SEP]
[CLS] in track and field , robinson won the 1940 ncaa championship in the long jump at 24 ft . [SEP]
[CLS] bel ##ying his future career , baseball was robinson ' s " worst sport " at ucla ; he hit . 09 ##7 in his only season , although in his first game he went 4 - for - 4 and twice stole home . [SEP]
[CLS] he played football as a senior , but the 1940 bruins won only one game . [SEP]
[CLS] in the spring , robinson left college just shy of graduation , despite the reservations of his mother and is ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] he took a job as an assistant athletic director with the government ' s national youth administration ( ny ##a ) [SEP]
[CLS] after the government ceased ny ##a operations , robinson traveled to honolulu in the fall of 1941 to play football for the semi - professional , racial ##ly integrated honolulu after a short season , robinson returned to california in december 1941 to pursue a career as running back for the los angeles bulldogs of the pacific coast football league . [SEP]
[CLS] by that time , however , the japanese attack on pearl harbor had taken place , which drew the united states into world war ii and ended robinson ' s nas ##cent football career . [SEP]
[CLS] having the re ##quisite qualifications , robinson and several other black soldiers applied for admission to an officer candidate school ( o ##cs ) then located at fort riley . [SEP]
[CLS] although the army ' s initial july 1941 guidelines for o ##cs had been drafted as race neutral , few black applicants were admitted into o ##cs until after subsequent directive ##s by army leadership . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , the applications of robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months . [SEP]
[CLS] after protests by heavyweight boxing champion joe louis ( then stationed at fort riley ) and the help of truman gibson ( then an assistant civilian aide to the secretary of war ) , the men were accepted into o ##cs . [SEP]
[CLS] after receiving his commission , robinson was reassigned to fort hood , texas , where he joined the 76 ##1 ##st " black panthers " tank battalion . [SEP]
[CLS] karl downs , president of sam hu ##ston college ( now hu ##ston - till ##ots ##on university ) in nearby austin , texas ; downs had been robinson ' s pastor at scott united methodist church while robinson attended p ##j ##c . [SEP]
[CLS] while awaiting results of hospital tests on the ankle he had injured in junior college , robinson boarded an army bus with a fellow officer ' s wife ; although the army had commissioned its own un ##se ##gre ##gated bus line , the bus driver ordered robinson to move to the back of the bus . [SEP]
[CLS] the driver backed down , but after reaching the end of the line , summoned the military police , who took robinson into custody . [SEP]
[CLS] after robinson ' s commander in the 76 ##1 ##st , paul l . bates , refused to author ##ize the legal action , robinson was sum ##mar ##ily transferred to the 75 ##8th battalion — where the commander quickly consent ##ed to charge robinson with multiple offenses , including , among other charges , public drunken ##ness , even though robinson did not drink . [SEP]
[CLS] although his former unit , the 76 ##1 ##st tank battalion , became the first black tank unit to see combat in world war ii , robinson ' s court - martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas ; thus , he never saw combat action . [SEP]
[CLS] after his ac ##qui ##ttal , he was transferred to camp br ##eck ##in ##ridge , kentucky , where he served as a coach for army athletics until receiving an honorable discharge in november 1944 . [SEP]
[CLS] while there , robinson met a former player for the kansas city monarchs of the negro american league , who encouraged robinson to write the monarchs and ask for a try ##out . [SEP]
[CLS] karl downs to be the athletic director at samuel hu ##ston college in austin , then of the southwestern athletic conference . [SEP]
[CLS] as it was a fledgling program , few students tried out for the basketball team , and robinson even resort ##ed to insert ##ing himself into the lineup for exhibition games . [SEP]
[CLS] although his teams were out ##mat ##ched by opponents , robinson was respected as a disc ##ip ##lina ##rian coach , and drew the admiration of , among others , lang ##ston university basketball player mar ##ques haynes , a future member of the harlem globe ##tro ##tters . [SEP]
[CLS] in early 1945 , while robinson was at sam hu ##ston college , the kansas city monarchs sent him a written offer to play professional baseball in the negro leagues . [SEP]
[CLS] he had grown used to a structured playing environment in college , and the negro leagues ' di ##sor ##gan ##ization and embrace of gambling interests appalled him . [SEP]
[CLS] in all , robinson played 47 games at shortstop for the monarchs , hitting . 38 ##7 with five home runs , and registering 13 stolen bases . [SEP]
[CLS] no black man had played in the major leagues since moses fleetwood walker in 1884 , but the boston red sox nevertheless held a try ##out at fen ##way park for robinson and other black players on april 16 . [SEP]
[CLS] the try ##out , however , was a far ##ce chiefly designed to ass ##ua ##ge the des ##eg ##re ##gation ##ist sen ##si ##bilities of powerful boston city council ##man isa ##dor ##e h . y . much ##nick . [SEP]
[CLS] even with the stands limited to management , robinson was subjected to racial epithet ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] other teams , however , had more serious interest in signing a black ball ##play ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] in the mid - 1940s , branch rick ##ey , club president and general manager of the brooklyn dodgers , began to scout the negro leagues for a possible addition to the dodgers ' roster . [SEP]
[CLS] rick ##ey selected robinson from a list of promising black players and interviewed him for possible assignment to brooklyn ' s international league farm club , the montreal royals . [SEP]
[CLS] in a famous three - hour exchange on august 28 , 1945 , rick ##ey asked robinson if he could face the racial an ##imus without taking the bait and reacting angrily — a concern given robinson ' s prior arguments with law enforcement officials at p ##j ##c and in the military . [SEP]
[CLS] rick ##ey did not offer compensation to the monarchs , instead believing all negro league players were free agents due to the contracts not containing a reserve clause . [SEP]
[CLS] among those rick ##ey discussed prospects with was wendell smith , writer for the black weekly " pittsburgh courier " , who according to cleveland indians owner and team president bill ve ##eck " influenced rick ##ey to take jack robinson , for which he ' s never completely gotten credit . " [SEP]
[CLS] although he required robinson to keep the arrangement a secret for the time being , rick ##ey committed to formally signing robinson before november 1 , 1945 . [SEP]
[CLS] on october 23 , it was publicly announced that robinson would be assigned to the royals for the 1946 season . [SEP]
[CLS] on the same day , with representatives of the royals and dodgers present , robinson formally signed his contract with the royals . [SEP]
[CLS] in what was later referred to as " the noble experiment " , robinson was the first black baseball player in the international league since the 1880s . [SEP]
[CLS] he was not necessarily the best player in the negro leagues , and black talents sat ##chel paige and josh gibson were upset when robinson was selected first . [SEP]
[CLS] larry do ##by , who broke the color line in the american league the same year as robinson , said , " one of the things that was disappointing and dish ##ear ##ten ##ing to a lot of the black players at the time was that jack was not the best player . [SEP]
[CLS] rick ##ey ' s offer allowed robinson to leave behind the monarchs and their gr ##uel ##ing bus rides , and he went home to pasadena . [SEP]
[CLS] that september , he signed with chet brewer ' s kansas city royals , a post - season barns ##torm ##ing team in the california winter league . [SEP]
[CLS] later that off - season , he briefly toured south america with another barns ##torm ##ing team , while his fiancee is ##um pursued nursing opportunities in new york city . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1946 , robinson arrived at daytona beach , florida , for spring training with the montreal royals of the class aaa international league ( the designation of " aaa " for the highest level of minor league baseball was first used in the 1946 season ) . [SEP]
[CLS] clay hopper , the manager of the royals , asked rick ##ey to assign robinson to any other dodge ##r affiliate , but rick ##ey refused . [SEP]
[CLS] he was not allowed to stay with his white teammates at the team hotel , and instead lodged at the home of joe and duff ##erin harris , a politically active african - american couple who introduced the robinson ##s to mary mcleod beth ##une . [SEP]
[CLS] in sanford , florida , the police chief threatened to cancel games if robinson and wright did not cease training activities there ; as a result , robinson was sent back to daytona beach . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson made his royals debut at daytona beach ' s city island ball ##park on march 17 , 1946 , in an exhibition game against the team ' s parent club , the dodgers . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson thus became the first black player to openly play for a minor league team against a major league team since the " de facto " baseball color line had been implemented in the 1880s . [SEP]
[CLS] later in spring training , after some less - than - stellar performances , robinson was shifted from shortstop to second base , allowing him to make shorter throws to first base . [SEP]
[CLS] on april 18 , 1946 , roosevelt stadium hosted the jersey city giants ' season opener against the montreal royals , marking the professional debut of the royals ' jackie robinson and the first time the color barrier had been broken in a game between two minor league clubs . [SEP]
[CLS] during robinson ' s first at bat , the jersey city catcher , dick bo ##uk ##night , demanded that sand ##el throw at robinson , but sand ##el refused . [SEP]
[CLS] he also scored four runs , drove in three , and stole two bases in the royals ' 14 – 1 victory . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson proceeded to lead the international league that season with a . 34 ##9 batting average and . 98 ##5 fielding percentage , and he was named the league ' s most valuable player . [SEP]
[CLS] although he often faced hostility while on road trips ( the royals were forced to cancel a southern exhibition tour , for example ) , the montreal fan base enthusiastically supported robinson . [SEP]
[CLS] whether fans supported or opposed it , robinson ' s presence on the field was a boon to attendance ; more than one million people went to games involving robinson in 1946 , an amazing figure by international league standards . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1947 , the dodgers called robinson up to the major leagues six days before the start of the season . [SEP]
[CLS] with eddie stan ##ky en ##tre ##nched at second base for the dodgers , robinson played his initial major league season as a first baseman . [SEP]
[CLS] on april 15 , robinson made his major league debut at the relatively advanced age of 28 at e ##bbe ##ts field before a crowd of 26 , 62 ##3 spectators , more than 14 , 000 of whom were black . [SEP]
[CLS] some dodge ##r players ins ##in ##uated they would sit out rather than play alongside robinson . [SEP]
[CLS] manager leo du ##ro ##cher informed the team , " i do not care if the guy is yellow or black , or if he has stripes like a fuck ##in ' zebra . [SEP]
[CLS] according to a press report , the st . louis cardinals threatened to strike if robinson played and to spread the walk ##out across the entire national league . [SEP]
[CLS] existence of the plot was said to have been leaked by the cardinals ' team physician , robert h ##yla ##nd , to a friend , the " new york herald tribune " ' s rutherford " ru ##d " ren ##nie . [SEP]
[CLS] the reporter , concerned about protecting h ##yla ##nd ' s an ##ony ##mity and job , in turn leaked it to his " tribune " colleague and editor , stanley woodward , whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected h ##yla ##nd . [SEP]
[CLS] after it was published , national league president ford fr ##ick and baseball commissioner happy chandler let it be known that any striking players would be suspended . [SEP]
[CLS] all will be suspended and i don ' t care if it wreck ##s the national league for five years . [SEP]
[CLS] even " the sporting news " , a publication that had backed the color line , came out against the idea of a strike . [SEP]
[CLS] on april 22 , 1947 , during a game between the dodgers and the philadelphia phillies , phillies players and manager ben chapman called robinson a " ni ##gger " from their dug ##out and yelled that he should " go back to the cotton fields " . [SEP]
[CLS] rick ##ey later recalled that chapman " did more than anybody to unite the dodgers . [SEP]
[CLS] when he poured out that string of un ##con ##sc ##ion ##able abuse , he solid ##ified and united thirty men . " [SEP]
[CLS] a statue by sculptor william be ##hre ##nds , unveiled at keys ##pan park on november 1 , 2005 , depicts reese with his arm around robinson . [SEP]
[CLS] jewish baseball star hank greenberg , who had to deal with ethnic epithet ##s during his career , also encouraged robinson . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson also talked frequently with larry do ##by , who endured his own hardship ##s since becoming the first black player in the american league with the cleveland indians , as the two spoke to one another via telephone throughout the season . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson led the league in sacrifice hits , with 28 , and in stolen bases , with 29 . [SEP]
[CLS] his cumulative performance earned him the inaugural major league baseball rookie of the year award ( separate national and american league rookie of the year honors were not awarded until 1949 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] following stan ##ky ' s trade to the boston braves in march 1948 , robinson took over second base , where he logged a . 980 fielding percentage that year ( second in the national league at the position , fraction ##ally behind stan ##ky ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the dodgers briefly moved into first place in the national league in late august 1948 , but they ultimately finished third as the braves went on to win the league title and lose to the cleveland indians in the world series . [SEP]
[CLS] racial pressure on robinson eased in 1948 when a number of other black players entered the major leagues . [SEP]
[CLS] larry do ##by ( who broke the color barrier in the american league on july 5 , 1947 , just 11 weeks after robinson ) and sat ##chel paige played for the cleveland indians , and the dodgers had three other black players besides robinson . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 1948 , he signed a $ 12 , 500 contract ( equal to $ today ) with the dodgers ; while a significant amount , this was less than robinson made in the off - season from a vaudeville tour , where he answered pre - set baseball questions and a speaking tour of the south . [SEP]
[CLS] because of his off - season activities , robinson reported to training camp 30 lb over ##weight . [SEP]
[CLS] at sis ##ler ' s suggestion , robinson spent hours at a batting tee , learning to hit the ball to right field . [SEP]
[CLS] sis ##ler taught robinson to anti ##ci ##pate a fast ##ball , on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curve ##ball . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to his improved batting average , robinson stole 37 bases that season , was second place in the league for both doubles and triple ##s , and registered 124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored . [SEP]
[CLS] for the performance robinson earned the most valuable player award for the national league . [SEP]
[CLS] ultimately , the dodgers won the national league pennant , but lost in five games to the new york yankees in the 1949 world series . [SEP]
[CLS] in july , he was called to testify before the united states house of representatives ' committee on un - american activities ( hua ##c ) concerning statements made that april by black athlete and actor paul robes ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson was reluctant to testify , but he eventually agreed to do so , fearing it might negatively affect his career if he declined . [SEP]
[CLS] he finished the year with 99 runs scored , a . 328 batting average , and 12 stolen bases . [SEP]
[CLS] the year saw the release of a film biography of robinson ' s life , " the jackie robinson story " , in which robinson played himself , and actress ruby dee played ra ##cha ##el " rae " ( is ##um ) robinson . [SEP]
[CLS] the project had been previously delayed when the film ' s producers refused to acc ##ede to demands of two hollywood studios that the movie include scenes of robinson being tutor ##ed in baseball by a white man . [SEP]
[CLS] " the new york times " wrote that robinson , " doing that rare thing of playing himself in the picture ' s leading role , displays a calm assurance and composure that might be en ##vie ##d by many a hollywood star . " [SEP]
[CLS] weary of constant disagreements with o ' malley , and with no hope of being re - appointed as president of the dodgers , rick ##ey cash ##ed out his one - quarter financial interest in the team , leaving o ' malley in full control of the franchise . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to rick ##ey , whom he considered a father figure , stating , " regardless of what happens to me in the future , it all can be placed on what you have done and , believe me , i appreciate it . " [SEP]
[CLS] o ' malley was quoted in the " montreal standard " as saying , " jackie told me that he would be both delighted and honored to tackle this managerial post " — although reports differed as to whether a position was ever formally offered . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1951 season , robinson led the national league in double plays made by a second baseman for the second year in a row , with 137 . [SEP]
[CLS] despite robinson ' s regular - season heroic ##s , on october 3 , 1951 , the dodgers lost the pennant on bobby thomson ' s famous home run , known as the shot heard ' round the world . [SEP]
[CLS] dodgers sports ##caster vin scully later noted that the incident showed " how much of a competitor robinson was . " [SEP]
[CLS] he finished the season with 106 runs scored , a batting average of . 335 , and 25 stolen bases . [SEP]
[CLS] the dodgers improved on their performance from the year before , winning the national league pennant before losing the 1952 world series to the new york yankees in seven games . [SEP]
[CLS] that year , on the television show " youth wants to know " , robinson challenged the yankees ' general manager , george weiss , on the racial record of his team , which had yet to sign a black player . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1952 season was the last year robinson was an everyday starter at second base . [SEP]
[CLS] afterward , robinson played variously at first , second , and third bases , shortstop , and in the out ##field , with jim gill ##iam , another black player , taking over everyday second base duties . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s interests began to shift toward the prospect of managing a major league team . [SEP]
[CLS] he had hoped to gain experience by managing in the puerto rican winter league , but according to the " new york post " , commissioner happy chandler denied the request . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1953 , robinson had 109 runs , a . 329 batting average , and 17 steals , leading the dodgers to another national league pennant ( and another world series loss to the yankees , this time in six games ) . [SEP]
[CLS] that year , he served as editor for " our sports " magazine , a periodical focusing on negro sports issues ; contributions to the magazine included an article on golf course segregation by robinson ' s old friend joe louis . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson also openly criticized segregated hotels and restaurants that served the dodge ##r organization ; a number of these establishments integrated as a result , including the five - star chase park hotel in st . louis . [SEP]
[CLS] the following autumn , robinson won his only championship when the dodgers beat the new york yankees in the 1955 world series . [SEP]
[CLS] although the team enjoyed ultimate success , 1955 was the worst year of robinson ' s individual career . [SEP]
[CLS] the dodgers tried robinson in the out ##field and as a third baseman , both because of his dim ##ini ##shing abilities and because gill ##iam was established at second base . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson missed the game because manager walter als ##ton decided to play gill ##iam at second and don ho ##ak at third base . [SEP]
[CLS] that season , the dodgers ' don new ##combe became the first black major league pitcher to win twenty games in a year . [SEP]
[CLS] by then , he had begun to exhibit the effects of diabetes and to lose interest in the prospect of playing or managing professional baseball . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ended his major league career when he struck out to end game 7 of the 1956 world series . [SEP]
[CLS] after the season , the dodgers traded robinson to the arch - rival new york giants for dick little ##field and $ 35 , 000 cash ( equal to $ today ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the trade , however , was never completed ; un ##bek ##now ##nst to the dodgers , robinson had already agreed with the president of cho ##ck full o ' nuts to quit baseball and become an executive with the company . [SEP]
[CLS] since robinson had sold exclusive rights to any retirement story to " look " magazine two years previously , his retirement decision was revealed through the magazine , instead of through the dodgers organization . [SEP]
[CLS] after world war ii , several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks , including their accelerated migration to the north , where their political cl ##out grew , and president harry truman ' s des ##eg ##re ##gation of the military in 1948 . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbol ##ized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter . [SEP]
[CLS] martin luther king , jr . said that he was " a legend and a symbol in his own time " , and that he " challenged the dark skies of into ##ler ##ance and frustration . " [SEP]
[CLS] according to historian doris ke ##arns goodwin , robinson ' s " efforts were a monumental step in the civil - rights revolution in america . . . his accomplishments allowed black and white americans to be more respectful and open to one another and more app ##re ##cia ##tive of everyone ' s abilities . " [SEP]
[CLS] beginning his major league career at the relatively advanced age of twenty - eight , he played only ten seasons from 1947 to 1956 , all of them for the brooklyn dodgers . [SEP]
[CLS] during his career , the dodgers played in six world series , and robinson himself played in six all - star games . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson ' s career is generally considered to mark the beginning of the post – " long ball " era in baseball , in which a reliance on raw power - hitting gave way to balanced offensive strategies that used foot ##sp ##eed to create runs through aggressive base ##run ##ning . [SEP]
[CLS] he scored more than 100 runs in six of his ten seasons ( averaging more than 110 runs from 1947 to 1953 ) , had a . 311 career batting average , a . 40 ##9 career on - base percentage , a . 47 ##4 slug ##ging percentage , and substantially more walks than strikeouts ( 740 to 291 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson was one of only two players during the span of 1947 – 56 to accumulate at least 125 steals while registering a slug ##ging percentage over . 425 ( minnie min ##oso was the other ) . [SEP]
[CLS] none of the latter were double steals ( in which a player stealing home is assisted by a player stealing another base at the same time ) . [SEP]
[CLS] historical statistical analysis indicates robinson was an outstanding fielder throughout his ten years in the major leagues and at virtually every position he played . [SEP]
[CLS] after playing his rookie season at first base , robinson spent most of his career as a second baseman . [SEP]
[CLS] toward the end of his career , he played about 2 , 000 innings at third base and about 1 , 175 innings in the out ##field , excel ##ling at both . [SEP]
[CLS] assessing himself , robinson said , " i ' m not concerned with your liking or di ##sl ##iki ##ng me . . . all i ask is that you respect me as a human being . " [SEP]
[CLS] regarding robinson ' s qualities on the field , leo du ##ro ##cher said , " ya want a guy that comes to play . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson once told future hall of fame ind ##uc ##tee hank aaron that " the game of baseball is great , but the greatest thing is what you do after your career is over . " [SEP]
[CLS] later that year , after he complained of numerous physical ai ##lm ##ents , he was diagnosed with diabetes , a disease that also af ##flict ##ed his brothers . [SEP]
[CLS] although robinson adopted an insulin injection regime ##n , the state of medicine at the time could not prevent the continued deterioration of robinson ' s physical condition from the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] in his first year of eligibility for the baseball hall of fame in 1962 , robinson encouraged voters to consider only his on - field qualifications , rather than his cultural impact on the game . [SEP]
[CLS] he was elected on the first ballot , becoming the first black player inducted into the cooper ##stown museum . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1965 , robinson served as an analyst for abc ' s " major league baseball game of the week " telecast ##s , the first black person to do so . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1966 , robinson was hired as general manager for the short - lived brooklyn dodgers of the continental football league . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1957 to 1964 , robinson was the vice president for personnel at cho ##ck full o ' nuts ; he was the first black person to serve as vice president of a major american corporation . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson also chaired the national association for the advancement of colored people ' s ( naacp ) million - dollar freedom fund drive in 1957 , and served on the organization ' s board until 1967 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1964 , he helped found , with harlem businessman dunbar mc ##lau ##rin , freedom national bank — a black - owned and operated commercial bank based in harlem . [SEP]
[CLS] he identified himself as a political independent , although he held conservative opinions on several issues , including the vietnam war ( he once wrote to martin luther king , jr . to defend the johnson administration ' s military policy ) . [SEP]
[CLS] after supporting richard nixon in his 1960 presidential race against john f . kennedy , robinson later praised kennedy e ##ff ##us ##ively for his stance on civil rights . [SEP]
[CLS] robinson was angered by conservative republican opposition to the civil rights act of 1964 , though a higher percentage of democrats voted against it in both the house and senate . [SEP]
[CLS] after the party nominated senator barry gold ##water of arizona instead , robinson left the party ' s convention commenting that he now had " a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a jew in hitler ' s germany " . [SEP]
[CLS] he made his final public appearance on october 15 , 1972 , throwing the ceremonial first pitch before game 2 of the world series at river ##front stadium in cincinnati . [SEP]
