The Klondike is a region of the Yukon territory in northwest Canada, east of the Alaskan border.
It lies around the Klondike River, a small river that enters the Yukon River from the east at Dawson City.
Gold has been mined continuously in that area except for a hiatus in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Early gold seekers found it difficult to pronounce the First Nations word, so "Klondike" was the result of this poor pronunciation.
The climate is warm in the short summer, and very cold during the long winter.
