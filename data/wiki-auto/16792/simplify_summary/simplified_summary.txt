it is around the klondike river , a small river that enters the yukon river from the east at dawson city .
gold has been mined continuously in that area except for a break in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
the name klondike comes from the han word " tr ' ondek " , which means " hammerstone water " .
early gold seekers found it difficult to pronounce the first nations word , so klondike was the result of this poor pronunciation .
the climate is warm in the short summer , and very cold during the winter .
