[CLS] howard walter fl ##ore ##y , baron fl ##ore ##y , ( 24 september 1898 ##21 february 1968 ) was an australian ph ##arm ##aco ##logist and path ##ologist who shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1945 with sir ernst chain and sir alexander fleming for his role in the development of pen ##ici ##llin . [SEP]
[CLS] although fleming received most of the credit for the discovery of pen ##ici ##llin , it was fl ##ore ##y who carried out the first ever clinical trials in 1941 of pen ##ici ##llin at the radcliffe infirmary in oxford on the first patient , a constable from oxford . [SEP]
[CLS] the patient started to recover but subsequently died because fl ##ore ##y was unable , at that time , to make enough pen ##ici ##llin . [SEP]
[CLS] it was fl ##ore ##y and chain who actually made a useful and effective drug out of pen ##ici ##llin , after the task had been abandoned as too difficult . [SEP]
[CLS] fl ##ore ##y ' s discoveries , along with the discoveries of alexander fleming and ernst chain , are estimated to have saved over 200 million lives , and he is consequently regarded by the australian scientific and medical community as one of its greatest figures . [SEP]
[CLS] sir robert men ##zie ##s , australia ' s longest - serving prime minister , said , " in terms of world well - being , fl ##ore ##y was the most important man ever born in australia " . [SEP]

[CLS] working with ernst boris chain , norman heat ##ley and edward abraham , he read alexander fleming ' s paper discussing the anti ##ba ##cter ##ial effects of " pen ##ici ##lli ##um not ##at ##um " mo ##uld . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1941 , he and chain treated their first patient , albert alexander , who had had a small sore at that corner of his mouth , which then spread leading to a severe facial infection involving st ##re ##pt ##oco ##cci and st ##ap ##hyl ##oco ##cci . [SEP]
[CLS] his whole face , eyes and scalp were swollen to the extent that he had had an eye removed to relieve some of the pain . [SEP]
[CLS] within a day of being given pen ##ici ##llin , he started recovering . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the researchers did not have enough pen ##ici ##llin to help him to a full recovery , and he re ##la ##pse ##d and died . [SEP]
[CLS] because of this experience and of the difficulty in producing pen ##ici ##llin , the researchers changed their focus to children , who could be treated with smaller quantities . [SEP]
[CLS] fl ##ore ##y ' s research team investigated the large - scale production of the mo ##uld and efficient extraction of the active ingredient , succeeding to the point where , by 1945 , pen ##ici ##llin production was an industrial process for the allies in world war ii . [SEP]
[CLS] fl ##ore ##y shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1945 with ernst boris chain and alexander fleming . [SEP]
