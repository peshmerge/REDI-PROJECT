howard walter florey , baron florey , zoological -lrb- 1898 â€“ 1968 -rrb- was an australian doctor and pathologist .
although fleming received most of the credit for the discovery of penicillin , it was florey who carried out the first ever clinical trials in 1941 of penicillin at the radcliffe infirmary in oxford on the first patient , a constable from oxford .
florey 's discoveries , along with the discoveries of alexander fleming and ernst chain , are thought to have saved over 200 million lives .
he was born in adelaide , south australia .
he studied medicine at the university of adelaide from 1917 to 1921 .
florey continued his studies at magdalen college , oxford as a rhodes scholar .
in 1925 , he left oxford to go to the university of cambridge .
he returned to england in 1926 and was elected to a fellowship at gonville and caius college , cambridge , and a year later he received the phd .
after cambridge , florey became the joseph hunter chair of pathology at the university of sheffield in 1932 .
he worked with ernst boris chain , norman heatley and edward abraham .
in 1941 , he and chain treated their first patient , albert alexander , who had a small sore at that corner of his mouth .
however , the researchers did not have enough penicillin to help him to a full recovery , and he relapsed and died .
because of this , the researchers had to use children with smaller quantities .
florey 's research team investigated the large-scale production of the mould and efficient extraction of the active ingredient .
florey shared the 1945 nobel prize in physiology or medicine with ernst boris chain and alexander fleming .
fleming first observed the antibiotic properties of the mould that makes penicillin , but it was chain and florey who developed it into a useful treatment .
in 1958 florey opened the john curtin school of medical research at anu in canberra .
in 1965 the queen made him lord florey .
he was awarded the lister medal in 1945 for his work in surgical science .
the lister oration was given at the royal college of surgeons of england later that year .
during his term as provost , the college built a new residential block , named the florey building in his honour .
he was made a life peer in 1965 , and became baron florey , of adelaide in the state of south australia and commonwealth of australia and marston in the county of oxford .
this was a higher honor than the knighthood awarded to penicillin 's discoverer , sir alexander fleming .
the lecture theatre at the john curtin school of medical research was named after him .
the florey institute of neuroscience and mental health is a lecture theatre in the university of adelaide 's medical school .
