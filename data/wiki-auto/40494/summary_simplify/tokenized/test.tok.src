[CLS] howard walter fl ##ore ##y , baron fl ##ore ##y , ( 24 september 1898 ##21 february 1968 ) was an australian ph ##arm ##aco ##logist and path ##ologist who shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1945 with sir ernst chain and sir alexander fleming for his role in the development of pen ##ici ##llin . [SEP]
[CLS] although fleming received most of the credit for the discovery of pen ##ici ##llin , it was fl ##ore ##y who carried out the first ever clinical trials in 1941 of pen ##ici ##llin at the radcliffe infirmary in oxford on the first patient , a constable from oxford . [SEP]
[CLS] fl ##ore ##y ' s discoveries , along with the discoveries of alexander fleming and ernst chain , are estimated to have saved over 200 million lives , and he is consequently regarded by the australian scientific and medical community as one of its greatest figures . [SEP]
[CLS] howard fl ##ore ##y was born in malvern , a southern suburb of adelaide , south australia , the youngest of three children and the only son . [SEP]
[CLS] he studied medicine at the university of adelaide from 1917 to 1921 , paid entirely by a state scholarship he won . [SEP]
[CLS] fl ##ore ##y continued his studies at mag ##dalen college , oxford as a rhodes scholar under the tu ##tel ##age of sir charles scott she ##rring ##ton , receiving the degrees of ba in 1924 and ma in 1935 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1925 , he left oxford to attend the university of cambridge , during which time he won a fellowship from the rockefeller foundation and studied in the united states for ten months . [SEP]
[CLS] he returned to england in 1926 and was elected to a fellowship at go ##n ##ville and cai ##us college , cambridge , and a year later he received the degree of phd . [SEP]
[CLS] after cambridge , fl ##ore ##y was appointed to the joseph hunter chair of pathology at the university of sheffield in 1932 . [SEP]
[CLS] working with ernst boris chain , norman heat ##ley and edward abraham , he read alexander fleming ' s paper discussing the anti ##ba ##cter ##ial effects of " pen ##ici ##lli ##um not ##at ##um " mo ##uld . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1941 , he and chain treated their first patient , albert alexander , who had had a small sore at that corner of his mouth , which then spread leading to a severe facial infection involving st ##re ##pt ##oco ##cci and st ##ap ##hyl ##oco ##cci . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the researchers did not have enough pen ##ici ##llin to help him to a full recovery , and he re ##la ##pse ##d and died . [SEP]
[CLS] because of this experience and of the difficulty in producing pen ##ici ##llin , the researchers changed their focus to children , who could be treated with smaller quantities . [SEP]
[CLS] fl ##ore ##y ' s research team investigated the large - scale production of the mo ##uld and efficient extraction of the active ingredient , succeeding to the point where , by 1945 , pen ##ici ##llin production was an industrial process for the allies in world war ii . [SEP]
[CLS] fl ##ore ##y shared the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1945 with ernst boris chain and alexander fleming . [SEP]
[CLS] fleming first observed the anti ##biotic properties of the mo ##uld that makes pen ##ici ##llin , but it was chain and fl ##ore ##y who developed it into a useful treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1958 fl ##ore ##y opened the john curt ##in school of medical research at an ##u in canberra . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1965 the queen made him lord fl ##ore ##y and he was offered , and accepted , the role of chancellor of the australian national university . [SEP]
[CLS] he was awarded the lister medal in 1945 for his contributions to surgical science . [SEP]
[CLS] the corresponding lister or ##ation , given at the royal college of surgeons of england later that year , was titled " use of micro - organisms for therapeutic purposes " . [SEP]
[CLS] during his term as provost , the college built a new residential block , named the fl ##ore ##y building in his honour . [SEP]
[CLS] on 4 february 1965 , sir howard was created a life peer and became baron fl ##ore ##y , of adelaide in the state of south australia and commonwealth of australia and of mars ##ton in the county of oxford . [SEP]
[CLS] this was a higher honour than the knight ##hood awarded to pen ##ici ##llin ' s discover ##er , sir alexander fleming , and it recognised the monumental work fl ##ore ##y did in making pen ##ici ##llin available in sufficient quantities to save millions of lives in the war , despite fleming ' s doubts that this was feasible . [SEP]
[CLS] the lecture theatre at the john curt ##in school of medical research was named for him during his tenure at the an ##u . [SEP]
[CLS] the fl ##ore ##y institute of neuroscience and mental health , located at the university of melbourne , victoria , and a lecture theatre in the university of adelaide ' s medical school are also named after him . [SEP]
[CLS] the defunct australian student prize , given to outstanding high - school leave ##rs , was previously called the " lord fl ##ore ##y student prize " in recognition of fl ##ore ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] on the lowest floor there is a commemorative statue and plaque . [SEP]
[CLS] he died of a heart attack in 1968 and was honoured with a memorial service at westminster abbey , london . [SEP]
[CLS] " breaking the mo ##uld " is a 2009 historical drama that tells the story of the development of pen ##ici ##llin in the 1930s and 40 ##s , by the group of scientists at oxford headed by fl ##ore ##y at the dunn school of pathology . [SEP]
[CLS] the film stars dominic west as fl ##ore ##y , denis lawson , and oliver dim ##sdale ; and was written by kate brooke and directed by peter ho ##ar . [SEP]
