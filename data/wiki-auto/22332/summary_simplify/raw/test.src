October is the tenth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars and the sixth of seven months to have a length of 31 days.
The eighth month in the old calendar of Romulus 750 , October retained its name (from the Latin "ôctō" meaning "eight") after January and February were inserted into the calendar that had originally been created by the Romans.
"This list does not necessarily imply either official status or general observance."
The last two to three weeks in October (and, occasionally, the first week of November) are the only time of the year during which all of the "Big Four" major North American professional sports leagues schedule games; the National Basketball Association begins its preseason and about two weeks later starts the regular season, the National Hockey League is about one month into its regular season, the National Football League is about halfway through its regular season, and Major League Baseball is in its postseason with the League Championship Series and World Series.
There have been 19 occasions in which all four leagues have played games on the same day (an occurrence popularly termed a "sports equinox"), with the most recent of these taking place on October 28, 2018.
Additionally, the Canadian Football League is typically nearing the end of its regular season during this period, while Major League Soccer is beginning the MLS Cup Playoffs.
