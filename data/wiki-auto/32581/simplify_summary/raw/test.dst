Van Diemen's Land was the original name used by most Europeans for the island of Tasmania, part of Australia.
The name was changed from Van Diemen's Land to Tasmania in 1856.
The Dutch explorer Abel Tasman was the first European to land on the shores of Tasmania in 1642.
Landing at Blackman Bay and later having the Dutch flag flown at North Bay, Tasman named the island Anthoonij van Diemenslandt, in honour of Anthony van Diemen, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, who had sent Tasman on his voyage of discovery.
Between 1772 and 1798, only the southeastern portion of the island was visited.
Tasmania was not known to be an island until Matthew Flinders and George Bass circumnavigated it in the "Norfolk" in 1798–99.
Around 1784–85, Henri Peyroux de la Coudrenière, an army officer serving in Spanish Louisiana, wrote a "memoir on the advantages to be gained for the Spanish crown by the settlement of Van Dieman's Land".
After receiving no response from the Spanish government, Peyroux proposed it to the French government, as "Mémoire sur les avantages qui résulteraient d'une colonie puissante à la terre de Diémen".
In January 1793, a French expedition under the command of Antoine Raymond Joseph de Bruni d'Entrecasteaux anchored in Recherche Bay and a period of five weeks was spent in that area, carrying out explorations into both natural history and geography.
In 1802 and 1803, the French expedition commanded by Nicolas Baudin explored D'Entrecasteaux Channel and Maria Island and carried out charting of Bass Strait (Baudin had been associated, like Peyroux, with the resettlement of the Acadians from French Canada (from mostly what is now called the New Brunswick/Nova Scotia area to Louisiana).
Sealers and whalers based themselves on Tasmania's islands from 1798 and in August 1803, New South Wales Governor Philip King sent Lieutenant John Bowen to establish a small military outpost on the eastern shore of the Derwent River to forestall any claims to the island arising from the activities of the French explorers.
From 24 September 1804 until 4 February 1813 Van Diemen's Land was split into two administrative divisions, Cornwall County in the north and Buckingham County in the south.
The border between the counties was defined as the 42nd parallel (now between Trial Harbour and Friendly Beaches).
Cornwall County was governed by William Paterson while Buckingham County was governed by David Collins.
Major-General Ralph Darling was appointed Governor of New South Wales in 1825, and in the same year he visited Hobart Town, and on 3 December proclaimed the establishment of the independent colony, of which he became governor for three days.
The demonym for Van Diemen's Land was "Van Diemonian", though contemporaries used the spelling Vandemonian.
In 1856, the colony was granted responsible self-government with its representative parliament, and the name of the island and colony was officially changed to Tasmania on 1 January 1856.
From the 1800s to the 1853 abolition of penal transportation (known simply as "transportation"), Van Diemen's Land was the primary penal colony in Australia.
Following the suspension of transportation to New South Wales, all transported convicts were sent to Van Diemen's Land.
In total, some 73,000 convicts were transported to Van Diemen's Land or about 40% of all convicts sent to Australia.
Male convicts served their sentences as assigned labour to free settlers or in gangs assigned to public works.
Only the most difficult convicts (mostly re-offenders) were sent to the Tasman Peninsula prison known as Port Arthur.
Female convicts were assigned as servants in free settler households or sent to a female factory (women's workhouse prison).
There were five female factories in Van Diemen's Land.
Convicts completing their sentences or earning their ticket-of-leave often promptly left Van Diemen's Land.
Many settled in the new free colony of Victoria, to the dismay of the free settlers in towns such as Melbourne.
On 6 August 1829, the brig "Cyprus", a government-owned vessel used to transport goods, people, and convicts, set sail from Hobart Town for Macquarie Harbour Penal Station on a routine voyage carrying supplies and convicts.
While the ship was becalmed in Recherche Bay, convicts allowed on deck attacked their guards and took control of the brig. The mutineers marooned officers, soldiers, and convicts who did not join the mutiny without supplies.
The convicts then sailed the "Cyprus" to Canton, China, where they scuttled her and claimed to be castaways from another vessel.
On the way, Cyprus visited Japan during the height of the period of severe Japanese restrictions on the entry of foreigners, the first Australian ship to do so.
Tensions sometimes ran high between the settlers and the "Vandemonians" as they were termed, particularly during the Victorian gold rush when a flood of settlers from Van Diemen's Land rushed to the Victorian goldfields.
Complaints from Victorians about recently released convicts from Van Diemen's Land re-offending in Victoria was one of the contributing reasons for the eventual abolition of transportation to Van Diemen's Land in 1853.
Anthony Trollope used the term "Vandemonian": "They are (the Vandemonians) united in their declaration that the cessation of the coming of convicts has been their ruin."
In 1856, Van Diemen's Land was renamed "Tasmania".
This removed the unsavoury criminal connotations with the name Van Diemen's Land (and the "demon" connotation) while honouring Abel Tasman, the first European to find the island.
The last penal settlement in Tasmania at Port Arthur closed in 1877.
Australian winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature Patrick White's novel "A Fringe of Leaves" places much of the novel's beginnings in Van Diemen's Land.
