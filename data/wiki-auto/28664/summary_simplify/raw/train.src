Sweetbread is a culinary name for the thymus (also called throat, gullet, or neck sweetbread) or pancreas (also called stomach, belly or gut sweetbread), typically from calf ("ris de veau") and lamb ("ris d'agneau"), and, less commonly, beef and pork.
Various other glands used as food may also sometimes be called "sweetbreads," including the parotid gland ("cheek" or "ear" sweetbread), the sublingual glands ("tongue" sweetbreads or "throat bread") as well as ovary and testicles.
One common preparation of sweetbreads involves soaking in salt water, then poaching in milk, after which the outer membrane is removed.
Once dried and chilled, they are often breaded and fried.
The word "sweetbread" is first attested in the 16th century, but the etymology of the name is unclear.
"Sweet" is perhaps used since the thymus is sweet and rich-tasting, as opposed to savory-tasting muscle flesh.
