[CLS] any act of worship that follows the islamic rules of prayer can be said to create a mosque , whether or not it takes place in a special building . [SEP]
[CLS] the pulpit ( " min ##bar " ) , from which the friday sermon ( " k ##hu ##t ##ba " ) is delivered , was in earlier times characteristic of the central city mosque , but has since become common in smaller mosques . [SEP]
[CLS] in modern times , they have preserved their role as places of religious instruction and debate , but higher learning now generally takes place in specialized institutions . [SEP]
[CLS] special importance is accord ##ed to the great mosque of mecca ( center of the ha ##j ##j ) , the prophet ' s mosque in medina ( burial place of muhammad ) and al - a ##q ##sa mosque in jerusalem ( believed to be the site of muhammad ' s ascent to heaven ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the past , many mosques in the muslim world were built over burial places of sufi saints and other ve ##ner ##ated figures , which has turned them into popular pilgrimage destinations . [SEP]
[CLS] while most pre - modern mosques were funded by charitable endowment ##s , modern states in the muslim world have attempted to bring mosques under government control . [SEP]
[CLS] increasing government regulation of large mosques has been countered by a rise of privately funded mosques of various affiliation ##s and id ##eo ##logies , many of which serve as bases for different islamic revival ##ist currents and social activism . [SEP]
[CLS] according to one set of views , islam started during the lifetime of muhammad in the 7th century ce , and so did architectural components such as the mosque . [SEP]
[CLS] in this case , either the mosque of the companions in the eritrea ##n city of mass ##awa , or the qu ##ba mosque in the he ##ja ##zi city of medina ( the first structure built by muhammad upon his emigration from mecca in 62 ##2 ce ) , would be the first mosque that was built in the history of islam . [SEP]
[CLS] according to another set of views , which uses passages of the quran , islam as a religion preceded muhammad , representing even previous prophets such as abraham . [SEP]
[CLS] since as early as 63 ##8 ad , the sacred mosque of mecca has been expanded on several occasions to accommodate the increasing number of muslims who either live in the area or make the annual pilgrimage known as " ha ##j ##j " to the city . [SEP]
[CLS] the prophet ' s mosque introduced some of the features still common in today ' s mosques , including the niche at the front of the prayer space known as the " mi ##hra ##b " and the tier ##ed pulpit called the " min ##bar " . [SEP]
[CLS] mosques had been built in iraq and north africa by the end of the 7th century , as islam spread outside the arabian peninsula with early caliphate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the imam hu ##say ##n shrine in ka ##rba ##la is reportedly one of the oldest mosques in iraq , although its present form ##typical of persian architecture ##on ##ly goes back to the 11th century . [SEP]
[CLS] the mosque of am ##r ibn al - as was reportedly the first mosque in egypt , serving as a religious and social center for fu ##sta ##t ( present - day cairo ) during its prime . [SEP]
[CLS] the great mosque of kai ##rou ##an in present - day tunisia was reportedly the first mosque built in northwest africa , with its present form ( dating from the 9th century ) serving as a model for other islamic places of worship in the mag ##hre ##b . [SEP]
[CLS] those features can also be found in and ##al ##usia ##n mosques , including the grand mosque of cordoba , as they tended to reflect the architecture of the moors instead of their vis ##igo ##th predecessors . [SEP]
[CLS] the first mosque in east asia was reportedly established in the 8th century in xi ' an . [SEP]
[CLS] following traditional chinese architecture , the great mosque of xi ' an , like many other mosques in eastern china , resembles a pagoda , with a green roof instead of the yellow roof common on imperial structures in china . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar integration of foreign and local influences could be seen on the indonesian islands of sumatra and java , where mosques , including the dem ##ak great mosque , were first established in the 15th century . [SEP]
[CLS] early javanese mosques took design cues from hindu , buddhist , and chinese architectural influences , with tall timber , multi - level roofs similar to the pagoda ##s of bali ##nese hindu temples ; the ubiquitous islamic dome did not appear in indonesia until the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] although mosques were first established in india during the 7th century , they were not commonplace across the subcontinent until the arrival of the mughal ##s in the 16th and 17th centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] reflecting their tim ##uri ##d origins , mughal - style mosques included onion domes , pointed arches , and elaborate circular mina ##ret ##s , features common in the persian and central asian styles . [SEP]
[CLS] the um ##ay ##yad caliphate was particularly instrumental in spreading islam and establishing mosques within the levant , as the um ##ay ##yad ##s constructed among the most revered mosques in the region — al - a ##q ##sa mosque and dome of the rock in jerusalem , and the um ##ay ##yad mosque in damascus . [SEP]
[CLS] the designs of the dome of the rock and the um ##ay ##yad mosque were influenced by byzantine architecture , a trend that continued with the rise of the ottoman empire . [SEP]
[CLS] several of the early mosques in the ottoman empire were originally churches or cathedral ##s from the byzantine empire , with the ha ##gia sophia ( one of those converted cathedral ##s ) informing the architecture of mosques from after the ottoman conquest of constantinople . [SEP]
[CLS] mosques from the ottoman period are still scattered across eastern europe , but the most rapid growth in the number of mosques in europe has occurred within the past century as more muslims have migrated to the continent . [SEP]
[CLS] many major european cities are home to mosques , like the grand mosque of paris , that incorporate domes , mina ##ret ##s , and other features often found with mosques in muslim - majority countries . [SEP]
[CLS] as in europe , the number of american mosques has rapidly increased in recent decades as muslim immigrants , particularly from south asia , have come in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] according to early muslim historians , towns that surrendered without resistance and made treaties with the muslims were allowed to retain their churches and the towns captured by muslims had many of their churches converted to mosques . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the earliest examples of these kinds of conversions was in damascus , syria , where in 70 ##5 um ##ay ##yad caliph al - wal ##id i bought the church of st . john from the christians and had it rebuilt as a mosque in exchange for building a number of new churches for the christians in damascus . [SEP]
[CLS] overall , abd al - malik ibn mar ##wan ( al - wal ##eed ' s father ) is said to have transformed 10 churches in damascus into mosques . [SEP]
[CLS] the process of turning churches into mosques were especially intensive in the villages where most of the inhabitants converted to islam . [SEP]
[CLS] in some instances mosques have been established on the places of jewish or christian san ##ct ##uaries associated with biblical personalities who were also recognized by islam . [SEP]
[CLS] mosques have also been converted for use by other religions , notably in southern spain , following the conquest of the moors in 149 ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the most prominent of them is the great mosque of cordoba , itself constructed on the site of a church demolished during the period of muslim rule . [SEP]
[CLS] these e ##id prayers are supposed to be offered in large groups , and so , in the absence of an outdoor " e ##id ##ga ##h " , a large mosque will normally host them for their cong ##re ##gan ##ts as well as the cong ##re ##gan ##ts of smaller local mosques . [SEP]
[CLS] some mosques will even rent convention centers or other large public buildings to hold the large number of muslims who attend . [SEP]
[CLS] mosques , especially those in countries where muslims are the majority , will also host e ##id prayers outside in courtyard ##s , town squares or on the outskirts of town in an " e ##id ##ga ##h " . [SEP]
[CLS] food is provided , at least in part , by members of the community , thereby creating daily pot ##lu ##ck dinners . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the community contribution necessary to serve " if ##tar " dinners , mosques with smaller congregations may not be able to host the " if ##tar " dinners daily . [SEP]
[CLS] some mosques will also hold " su ##hur " meals before dawn to cong ##re ##gan ##ts attending the first required prayer of the day , " fa ##j ##r " . [SEP]
[CLS] as with if ##tar dinners , cong ##re ##gan ##ts usually provide the food for su ##ho ##or , although able mosques may provide food instead . [SEP]
[CLS] mosques will often invite poorer members of the muslim community to share in beginning and breaking the fast ##s , as providing charity during rama ##dan is regarded in islam as especially honorable . [SEP]
[CLS] during each night of prayers , which can last for up to two hours each night , usually one member of the community who has memo ##rized the entire quran ( a ha ##fi ##z ) will rec ##ite a segment of the book . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes , several such people ( not necessarily of the local community ) take turns to do this . [SEP]
[CLS] mosques or the community usually provide meals periodically throughout the night during the last ten days of rama ##dan , larger mosques within the muslim community will host " i ##ʿ ##ti ##ka ##f " , a practice in which at least one muslim man from the community must participate . [SEP]
[CLS] muslims performing it ##ika ##f are required to stay within the mosque for ten consecutive days , often in worship or learning about islam . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , the rest of the muslim community is responsible for providing the participants with food , drinks , and whatever else they need during their stay . [SEP]
[CLS] since mosques form the center of muslim communities , they are where muslims go to both give " za ##kat " and , if necessary , collect it . [SEP]
[CLS] before the holiday of " e ##id ul - fit ##r " , mosques also collect a special " za ##kat " that is supposed to assist in helping poor muslims attend the prayers and celebrations associated with the holiday . [SEP]
[CLS] the frequency by which muslims attend mosque services vary greatly around the world . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states in particular , it has been shown in a study done by the institute for social policy and understanding that muslim americans who regularly attend mosques are more likely to work with their neighbors to solve community problems ( 49 vs . 30 percent ) , be registered to vote ( 74 vs . 49 percent ) , and plan to vote ( 92 vs . 81 percent ) . [SEP]
[CLS] overall , “ there is no correlation between muslim attitudes toward violence and their frequency of mosque attendance . ” [SEP]
[CLS] when it comes to mosque attendance , data shows that american muslim women and american muslim men attend the mosque at similar rates ( 45 % for men and 35 % for women ) . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , when compared to the general public looking at the attendance of religious services , young muslim americans attend the mosque at closer rates to older muslim americans . [SEP]
[CLS] the late 20th century saw an increase in the number of mosques used for political purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] while some governments in the muslim world have attempted to limit the content of friday sermons to strictly religious topics , there are also independent preacher ##s who deliver " k ##hu ##t ##bas " that address social and political issues , often in emotionally charged terms . [SEP]
[CLS] common themes include social in ##e ##qual ##ities , necessity of jihad in the face of injustice , the universal struggle between good and evil , with the west often symbol ##izing moral and spiritual decade ##nce , and criticism of local rulers for corruption and in ##ef ##fi ##ciency . [SEP]
[CLS] countries with a minority muslim population are more likely than muslim - majority countries of the greater middle east to use mosques as a way to promote civic participation . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result of these efforts as well as attempts at mosques to keep muslims informed about the issues facing the muslim community , regular mosque attendants are more likely to participate in protests , sign petitions , and otherwise be involved in politics . [SEP]
[CLS] as they are considered important to the muslim community , mosques , like other places of worship , can be at the heart of social conflicts . [SEP]
[CLS] the controversy surrounded the mosque was directly linked to riot ##ing in bombay ( present - day mumbai ) as well as bombings in 1993 that killed 257 people . [SEP]
[CLS] following the al - ask ##ari mosque bombing in iraq , imam ##s and other islamic leaders used mosques and friday prayers as vehicles to call for calm and peace in the midst of widespread violence . [SEP]
[CLS] a study 2005 indicated that while support for suicide bombings is not correlated with personal devotion to islam among palestinian muslims , it is correlated with mosque attendance because " participating in communal religious rituals of any kind likely encourages support for self - sac ##ri ##fi ##cing behaviors that are done for the collective good . " [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , the jewish defense league was suspected of plotting to bomb the king fa ##hd mosque in cu ##lver city , california . [SEP]
[CLS] outside the western world , in june 2001 , the hassan be ##k mosque was the target of van ##dal ##ism and attacks by hundreds of israelis after a suicide bomber killed 19 people in a night club in tel aviv . [SEP]
[CLS] although mosque ##going is highly encouraged for men , it is permitted to stay at home when one feels at risk from islam ##op ##ho ##bic persecution . [SEP]
[CLS] although the saudi involvement in sunni mosques around the world can be traced back to the 1960s , it was not until later in the 20th century that the government of saudi arabia became a large influence in foreign sunni mosques . [SEP]
[CLS] saudi citizens have also contributed significantly to mosques in the islamic world , especially in countries where they see muslims as poor and op ##pressed . [SEP]
[CLS] the king fa ##hd mosque in cu ##lver city , california and the islamic cultural center of italy in rome represent two of saudi arabia ' s largest investments in foreign mosques as former saudi king fa ##hd bin abdul aziz al - sa ##ud contributed us $ 8 million and us $ 50 million to the two mosques , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] in the western world , and in the united states in particular , anti - muslim sentiment and targeted domestic policy has created challenges for mosques and those looking to build them . [SEP]
[CLS] ni ##ng ##xia officials were notified on 3 august 2018 that the wei ##zhou grand mosque would be forcibly demolished because it had not received the proper permits before construction . [SEP]
[CLS] officials in the town said that the mosque had not been given proper building permits , because it is built in a middle eastern style and includes numerous domes and mina ##ret ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the residents of wei ##zhou alarmed each other through social media and finally stopped the mosque destruction by public demonstrations . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the most notable h ##yp ##ost ##yle mosques is the great mosque of cordoba in spain , the building being supported by over 850 columns . [SEP]
[CLS] frequently , h ##yp ##ost ##yle mosques have outer arcade ##s so that visitors can enjoy the shade . [SEP]
[CLS] arab - plan mosques were constructed mostly under the um ##ay ##yad and abbas ##id dynasties ; subsequently , however , the simplicity of the arab plan limited the opportunities for further development , the mosques consequently losing popularity . [SEP]
[CLS] the persians had inherited a rich architectural legacy from the earlier persian dynasties , and they began incorporating elements from earlier part ##hian and sas ##san ##id designs into their mosques , influenced by buildings such as the palace of ar ##das ##hir and the sar ##ves ##tan palace . [SEP]
[CLS] during se ##l ##ju ##q rule , as islamic mystic ##ism was on the rise , the four - i ##wan arrangement took form . [SEP]
[CLS] the four - i ##wan format , finalized by the se ##l ##ju ##q ##s , and later inherited by the sa ##fa ##vid ##s , firmly established the courtyard facade of such mosques , with the towering gateway ##s at every side , as more important than the actual buildings themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] they typically took the form of a square - shaped central courtyard with large entrances at each side , giving the impression of gateway ##s to the spiritual world . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to having a large central dome , a common feature is smaller domes that exist off - center over the prayer hall or throughout the rest of the mosque , where prayer is not performed . [SEP]
[CLS] this style was heavily influenced by byzantine architecture with its use of large central domes . [SEP]
[CLS] the fai ##sal mosque in islamabad , pakistan , in a relatively unusual design fuse ##s contemporary lines with the more traditional look of an arab bed ##ouin ' s tent , with its large triangular prayer hall and four mina ##ret ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the ones found in europe and north america appear to have various styles but most are built on western architectural designs , some are former churches or other buildings that were used by non - muslims . [SEP]
[CLS] in africa , most mosques are old but the new ones are built in imitation of those of the middle east . [SEP]
[CLS] a common feature in mosques is the mina ##ret , the tall , slender tower that usually is situated at one of the corners of the mosque structure . [SEP]
[CLS] the first mosques had no mina ##ret ##s , and even nowadays the most conservative islamic movements , like wah ##hab ##is , avoid building mina ##ret ##s , seeing them as os ##ten ##tat ##ious and hazardous in case of collapse . [SEP]
[CLS] the first mina ##ret was constructed in 66 ##5 in bas ##ra during the reign of the um ##ay ##yad caliph mu ##aw ##iya ##h i . mu ##aw ##iya ##h encouraged the construction of mina ##ret ##s , as they were supposed to bring mosques on par with christian churches with their bell towers . [SEP]
[CLS] the oldest standing mina ##ret in the world is the mina ##ret of the great mosque of kai ##rou ##an in tunisia , built between the 8th and the 9th century , it is a massive square tower consisting of three super ##im ##posed tier ##s of gradual size and decor . [SEP]
[CLS] in many countries like singapore where muslims are not the majority , mosques are prohibited from loudly broadcasting the " ad ##han " ( , call to prayer ) , although it is supposed to be said loudly to the surrounding community . [SEP]
[CLS] however , nearly every mosque assigns a " mu ##ez ##zin " for each prayer to say the " ad ##han " as it is a recommended practice or " sun ##nah " of the islamic prophet muhammad . [SEP]
[CLS] at mosques that do not have mina ##ret ##s , the " ad ##han " is called instead from inside the mosque or somewhere else on the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] the " iq ##ama ##h " , which is similar to the " ad ##han " and proclaimed right before the commencement of prayers , is usually not proclaimed from the mina ##ret even if a mosque has one . [SEP]
[CLS] the domes , often placed directly above the main prayer hall , may sign ##ify the vaults of the heaven and sky . [SEP]
[CLS] as time progressed , domes grew , from occupying a small part of the roof near the mi ##hra ##b to encompassing the whole roof above the prayer hall . [SEP]
[CLS] although domes normally took on the shape of a hemisphere , the mughal ##s in india popularized onion - shaped domes in south asia which has gone on to become characteristic of the arabic architectural style of dome . [SEP]
[CLS] some mosques have multiple , often smaller , domes in addition to the main large dome that resides at the center . [SEP]
[CLS] some mosques have islamic call ##igraphy and quran ##ic verses on the walls to assist worship ##pers in focusing on the beauty of islam and its ho ##liest book , the quran , as well as for decoration . [SEP]
[CLS] once designated , there are one ##rous limitations on the use of this formally designated masjid , and it may not be used for any purpose other than worship ; restrictions that do not necessarily apply to the rest of the prayer area , and to the rest of the mosque complex ( although such uses may be restricted by the conditions of the " wa ##q ##f " that owns the mosque ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in many mosques , especially the early congregational mosques , the prayer hall is in the h ##yp ##ost ##yle form ( the roof held up by a multitude of columns ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the qi ##bla ##h wall should , in a properly oriented mosque , be set perpendicular to a line leading to mecca , the location of the ka ##aba . [SEP]
[CLS] cong ##re ##gan ##ts pray in rows parallel to the qi ##bla ##h wall and thus arrange themselves so they face mecca . [SEP]
[CLS] in the qi ##bla ##h wall , usually at its center , is the mi ##hra ##b , a niche or depression indicating the direction of mecca . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , foyer ##s with shelves to put shoes and racks to hold coats are commonplace among mosques . [SEP]
[CLS] as mosques are supposed to appeal to the community , they may also have additional facilities , from health clinics to libraries to gymnasium ##s , to serve the community . [SEP]
[CLS] while there are several rules , such as those regarding not allowing shoes in the prayer hall , that are universal , there are many other rules that are dealt with and enforced in a variety of ways from mosque to mosque . [SEP]
[CLS] the permanent prayer leader ( imam ) must be a free honest individual and is authoritative in religious matters . [SEP]
[CLS] in mosques constructed and maintained by the government , the prayer leader is appointed by the ruler ; in private mosques , however , appointment is made by members of the congregation through majority voting . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the hana ##fi and malik ##i school of islamic jurisprudence , appointment of a prayer leader for friday service is mandatory because otherwise the prayer is invalid . [SEP]
[CLS] the sha ##fi ' i and han ##bal ##i schools , however , argue that the appointment is not necessary and the prayer is valid as long as it is performed in a congregation . [SEP]
[CLS] a slave may lead a friday prayer , but muslim authorities disagree over whether the job can be done by a minor . [SEP]
[CLS] all mosques have rules regarding clean ##liness , as it is an essential part of the worship ##pers ' experience . [SEP]
[CLS] however , even to those who enter the prayer hall of a mosque without the intention of praying , there are still rules that apply . [SEP]
[CLS] shoes must not be worn inside the carpet ##ed prayer hall . [SEP]
[CLS] some mosques will also extend that rule to include other parts of the facility even if those other locations are not devoted to prayer . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also und ##es ##ira ##ble to come to the mosque after eating something that smells , such as garlic . [SEP]
[CLS] men are supposed to come to the mosque wearing loose and clean clothes that do not reveal the shape of the body . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , it is recommended that women at a mosque wear loose clothing that covers to the wrists and ankles , and cover their heads with a " hi ##ja ##b " , or other covering . [SEP]
[CLS] many muslims , regardless of their ethnic background , wear middle eastern clothing associated with arabic islam to special occasions and prayers at mosques . [SEP]
[CLS] loud talking within the mosque , as well as discussion of topics deemed di ##sr ##es ##pe ##ct ##ful , is forbidden in areas where people are praying . [SEP]
[CLS] the walls within the mosque have few items , except for possibly islamic call ##igraphy , so muslims in prayer are not distracted . [SEP]
[CLS] by traditional rules , women are most often told to occupy the rows behind the men . [SEP]
[CLS] in part , this was a practical matter as the traditional posture for prayer ##k ##nee ##ling on the floor , head to the ground ##made mixed - gender prayer uncomfortably revealing for many women and distracting for some men . [SEP]
[CLS] traditional ##ists try to argue that muhammad preferred women to pray at home rather than at a mosque , and they cite a " had ##ith " in which muhammad supposedly said : " the best mosques for women are the inner parts of their houses , " although women were active participants in the mosque started by muhammad . [SEP]
[CLS] the second sunni caliph ' umar at one time prohibited women from attending mosques especially at night because he feared they may be sexually harassed or assaulted by men , so he required them to pray at home . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes a special part of the mosque was rail ##ed off for women ; for example , the governor of mecca in 870 had ropes tied between the columns to make a separate place for women . [SEP]
[CLS] in nearly two - thirds of american mosques , women pray behind partition ##s or in separate areas , not in the main prayer hall ; some mosques do not admit women at all due to the lack of space and the fact that some prayers , such as the friday ju ##mu ##ʻ ##ah , are mandatory for men but optional for women . [SEP]
[CLS] a dissent ##ing opinion and minority view is presented by followers of the malik ##i school of islamic jurisprudence , who argue that non - muslims may not be allowed into mosques under any circumstances . [SEP]
[CLS] the quran addresses the subject of non - muslims , and particularly poly ##the ##ists , in mosques in two verses in its ninth chapter , sur ##a at - ta ##w ##ba . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the um ##ay ##yad caliph umar ii later forbade non - muslims from entering mosques , and his ruling remains in practice in present - day saudi arabia . [SEP]
[CLS] today , the decision on whether non - muslims should be allowed to enter mosques varies . [SEP]
[CLS] many mosques throughout the united states welcome non - muslims as a sign of open ##ness to the rest of the community as well as to encourage conversions to islam . [SEP]
[CLS] for mosques in other areas , it has most commonly been taken that non - muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by muslims , and if they have a legitimate reason . [SEP]
[CLS] visiting a mosque is allowed only between prayers ; visitors are required to wear long trousers and not to wear shoes , women must cover their heads ; visitors are not allowed to interrupt praying muslims , especially by taking photos of them ; no loud talk is allowed ; and no references to other religions are allowed ( no crosses on necklace ##s , no cross gestures , etc . ) [SEP]
[CLS] in certain times and places , non - muslims were expected to behave a certain way in the vicinity of a mosque : in some moroccan cities , jews were required to remove their shoes when passing by a mosque ; in 18th - century egypt , jews and christians had to di ##smo ##unt before several mosques in ve ##ner ##ation of their san ##ct ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] the association of the mosque with education remained one of its main characteristics throughout history , and the school became an ind ##is ##pen ##sable app ##end ##age to the mosque . [SEP]
[CLS] from the earliest days of islam , the mosque was the center of the muslim community , a place for prayer , meditation , religious instruction , political discussion , and a school . [SEP]
