[CLS] an imaginary number is a complex number that can be written as a real number multiplied by the imaginary unit i , which is defined by its property " i " = − ##1 . [SEP]
[CLS] the square of an imaginary number bi is − " b " . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , 5 " i " is an imaginary number , and its square is − ##25 . [SEP]
[CLS] zero is considered to be both real and imaginary . [SEP]
[CLS] originally coined in the 17th century by rene des ##car ##tes as a der ##oga ##tory term and regarded as fictitious or useless , the concept gained wide acceptance following the work of leon ##hard eu ##ler and carl friedrich ga ##uss . [SEP]
[CLS] an imaginary number " bi " can be added to a real number a to form a complex number of the form " a " + " bi " , where the real numbers a and b are called , respectively , the " real part " and the " imaginary part " of the complex number . [SEP]
[CLS] some authors use the term pure imaginary number to denote what is called here an imaginary number , and " imaginary number " to denote any complex number with non - zero imaginary part . [SEP]
[CLS] although greek mathematician and engineer heron of alexandria is noted as the first to have conceived these numbers , rafael bomb ##elli first set down the rules for multiplication of complex numbers in 157 ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the concept had appeared in print earlier , for instance in work by ge ##rol ##amo card ##ano . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time imaginary numbers , as well as negative numbers , were poorly understood and regarded by some as fictitious or useless , much as zero once was . [SEP]
[CLS] many other mathematicians were slow to adopt the use of imaginary numbers , including rene des ##car ##tes , who wrote about them in his " la geo ##met ##rie " , where the term " imaginary " was used and meant to be der ##oga ##tory . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of imaginary numbers was not widely accepted until the work of leon ##hard eu ##ler ( 1707 – 1783 ) and carl friedrich ga ##uss ( 1777 – 1855 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the geometric significance of complex numbers as points in a plane was first described by cas ##par wes ##sel ( 1745 – 1818 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1843 william rowan hamilton extended the idea of an axis of imaginary numbers in the plane to a four - dimensional space of qu ##ater ##nio ##n im ##agi ##nar ##ies , in which three of the dimensions are analogous to the imaginary numbers in the complex field . [SEP]
[CLS] with the development of quo ##tie ##nt rings of polynomial rings , the concept behind an imaginary number became more substantial , but then one also finds other imaginary numbers such as the j of tessa ##rine ##s which has a square of + 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] this idea first surfaced with the articles by james cock ##le beginning in 1848 . [SEP]
[CLS] geometric ##ally , imaginary numbers are found on the vertical axis of the complex number plane , allowing them to be presented perpendicular to the real axis . [SEP]
[CLS] one way of viewing imaginary numbers is to consider a standard number line , positively increasing in magnitude to the right , and negatively increasing in magnitude to the left . [SEP]
[CLS] at 0 on this x - axis , a y - axis can be drawn with " positive " direction going up ; " positive " imaginary numbers then increase in magnitude upwards , and " negative " imaginary numbers increase in magnitude downwards . [SEP]
[CLS] this vertical axis is often called the " imaginary axis " and is denoted " i " r , formula _ 1 , or i . [SEP]
[CLS] in this representation , multiplication by – 1 corresponds to a rotation of 180 degrees about the origin . [SEP]
[CLS] multiplication by i corresponds to a 90 - degree rotation in the " positive " direction ( i . e . , counter ##cl ##ock ##wise ) , and the equation " i " = − ##1 is interpreted as saying that if we apply two 90 - degree rotation ##s about the origin , the net result is a single 180 - degree rotation . [SEP]
[CLS] note that a 90 - degree rotation in the " negative " direction ( i . e . clockwise ) also sat ##is ##fies this interpretation . [SEP]
[CLS] this reflects the fact that − " i " also solve ##s the equation " x " = − ##1 . [SEP]
[CLS] in general , multi ##ply ##ing by a complex number is the same as rotating around the origin by the complex number ' s argument , followed by a scaling by its magnitude . [SEP]
[CLS] care must be used when working with imaginary numbers expressed as the principal values of the square roots of negative numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] for example : sometimes this is written as : the fall ##acy occurs as the equality formula _ 4 does not hold when the variables are not suit ##ably constrained . [SEP]
[CLS] in this case the equality does not hold as the numbers are both negative . [SEP]
[CLS] this can be demonstrated by , where both " x " and " y " are non - negative real numbers . [SEP]
