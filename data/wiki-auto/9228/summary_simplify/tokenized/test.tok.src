[CLS] earth is the third planet from the sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life . [SEP]
[CLS] earth ' s gravity interact ##s with other objects in space , especially the sun and the moon , earth ' s only natural satellite . [SEP]
[CLS] earth ' s axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane , producing seasons on earth . [SEP]
[CLS] the gravitational interaction between earth and the moon causes tides , stabilize ##s earth ' s orientation on its axis and gradually slow ##s its rotation . [SEP]
[CLS] earth is the dense ##st planet in the solar system and the largest and most massive of the four terrestrial planets . [SEP]
[CLS] earth ' s lit ##hos ##pher ##e is divided into several rigid te ##cton ##ic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years . [SEP]
[CLS] the remaining 29 % is land consisting of continents and islands that together contain many lakes , rivers and other sources of water that contribute to the hydro ##sphere . [SEP]
[CLS] earth ' s interior remains active with a solid iron inner core , a liquid outer core that generates the earth ' s magnetic field and a con ##ve ##cting mantle that drives plate te ##cton ##ics . [SEP]
[CLS] within the first billion years of earth ' s history , life appeared in the oceans and began to affect the earth ' s atmosphere and surface , leading to the proliferation of ana ##ero ##bic and , later , aero ##bic organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] since then , the combination of earth ' s distance from the sun , physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive . [SEP]
[CLS] in the history of life on earth , biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion , occasionally pun ##ctuated by mass extinction events . [SEP]
[CLS] the modern english word " earth " developed from a wide variety of middle english forms , which derived from an old english noun most often spelled " e ##or ##ð ##e " . [SEP]
[CLS] in its earliest appearances , " e ##or ##ð ##e " was already being used to translate the many senses of latin " terra " and greek γ ##η ( " ge " ) : the ground , its soil , dry land , the human world , the surface of the world ( including the sea ) , and the globe itself . [SEP]
[CLS] as with terra and ga ##ia , earth was a person ##ified goddess in germanic pagan ##ism : the angles were listed by ta ##cit ##us as among the devotees of ne ##rth ##us , and later norse mythology included jo ##r ##ð , a giant ##ess often given as the mother of thor . [SEP]
[CLS] by early modern english , many nouns were capital ##ized , and " the earth " became ( and often remained ) " the earth " , particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies . [SEP]
[CLS] more recently , the name is sometimes simply given as " earth " , by analogy with the names of the other planets . [SEP]
[CLS] house styles now vary : oxford spelling recognizes the lower ##case form as the most common , with the capital ##ized form an acceptable variant . [SEP]
[CLS] according to nebula ##r theory , planet ##es ##ima ##ls formed by acc ##ret ##ion , with the pri ##mo ##rdial earth taking 10 – ( my ##s ) to form . [SEP]
[CLS] a leading hypothesis is that it was formed by acc ##ret ##ion from material loose ##d from earth after a mars - sized object , named the ##ia , hit earth . [SEP]
[CLS] between approximately 4 . 1 and , numerous asteroid impacts during the late heavy bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the moon and , by inference , to that of earth . [SEP]
[CLS] earth ' s atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and out ##gas ##sing . [SEP]
[CLS] water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans , augmented by water and ice from asteroids , proto ##plane ##ts , and comets . [SEP]
[CLS] in this model , atmospheric " greenhouse gases " kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming sun had only 70 % of its current lu ##min ##osity . [SEP]
[CLS] a crust formed when the molten outer layer of earth cooled to form a solid . [SEP]
[CLS] the two models that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present - day forms or , more likely , a rapid growth early in earth history followed by a long - term steady continental area . [SEP]
[CLS] continents formed by plate te ##cton ##ics , a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from earth ' s interior . [SEP]
[CLS] over the period of hundreds of millions of years , the super ##con ##tine ##nts have assembled and broken apart . [SEP]
[CLS] the continents later rec ##om ##bine ##d to form pan ##not ##ia , then finally pang ##aea , which also broke apart . [SEP]
[CLS] high - latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of g ##la ##ciation and tha ##w , repeating about every . [SEP]
