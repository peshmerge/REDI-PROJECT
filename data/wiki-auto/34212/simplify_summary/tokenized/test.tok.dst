[CLS] some filming locations are confidential , but many scenes were recorded in places such as the wait ##aker ##e ranges regional park , part of the auckland regional parks often credited at the end of the episodes . [SEP]
[CLS] the ancient greece depicted in the show is largely derived from historical locations and customs , modifying known places and events – battles , trading routes , towns , and so on – to generate an attractive fictional world . [SEP]
[CLS] the settlements are presented as a mixture of walled villages and rural hamlets set in a lush green , mountainous landscape . [SEP]
[CLS] they are often seen under attack from warlord ##s , and travelling between them involves frequent encounters with small bands of outlaws . [SEP]
[CLS] all of the main towns are named after historic towns of ancient greece , and exhibit some of their essential characteristics – amp ##hip ##olis ( birthplace of x ##ena ) , pot ##idae ##a ( birthplace of ) , athens ( birthplace of jo ##x ##er ) , co ##rin ##th , del ##phi , and ci ##rra ( birthplace of call ##isto ) which was burnt to the ground by x ##ena ' s army .

[CLS] as the show progressed , however , events took place throughout more modern times and places , from cleopatra ' s alexandria to julius caesar ' s rome . [SEP]
[CLS] the mythology of the show transitioned from that of the olympian gods to include jude ##o - christian elements . [SEP]
[CLS] eastern religions were touched on as well , with little regard to accurate time - and - place concerns . [SEP]
[CLS] one episode , " the way " , which loosely interpreted elements of hinduism as major plot points , generated controversy , requiring the producers to add a disc ##lai ##mer at the head of the episode and a tag explaining the episode ' s intentions at its end . [SEP]
[CLS] mythological and supernatural locations are presented as equally real , physical places , often accessed through physical portals hidden in the landscape such as lakes and caves . [SEP]
[CLS] they include the ely ##sian fields , tar ##tar ##us , the river styx , val ##hall ##a , heaven and hell . [SEP]
[CLS] the inhabitants of such places – gods , mythological beings and forces – are for the most part manifested as human characters who can move at will between their domains and the real world . [SEP]

[CLS] these include an encounter with homer before he was famous , in which gabrielle encourages his storytelling aspirations ; the fall of troy ; and the capture of caesar by pirates , with x ##ena cast as the pirate leader . [SEP]
[CLS] competing religions are treated as compatible and co - existent in a hen ##oth ##eis ##tic world , allowing the greek pantheon to live side by side with the norse gods , indian deities , the " god of love " and others . [SEP]
[CLS] each god , or set of gods , controls a different part of the world , and ( in the show ) survives only while people believe in it . [SEP]

[CLS] in " hercules " , during her two first episodes , x ##ena was a villain and a powerful warlord , but in her third appearance she joins hercules to defeat the warlord dar ##phus , who had taken her army . [SEP]
[CLS] during her own series , x ##ena spends almost every episode on a different mission , always trying to do the right thing , fighting for what she refers to as the " greater good " . [SEP]
[CLS] x ##ena ' s trademark weapon is a cha ##kra ##m , and she also uses a sword . [SEP]
[CLS] x ##ena also has to fight her own past ; she has never forgiven herself for her crimes , and often has to resist the temptation to return to her evil ways , but she always resist ##s with the help of gabrielle . [SEP]
[CLS] gabrielle is x ##ena ' s best friend , soul ##mate and also her greatest ally . [SEP]
[CLS] she is introduced in the first episode , first as a big fan of x ##ena and her history , but soon becomes a notable character in her own right . [SEP]
[CLS] as the show progresses she undergoes significant changes in costume and style , evolving from a simple farm girl to a talented bard , and eventually to a formidable warrior . [SEP]
[CLS] she is initiated into a tribe of amazon ##s , learns to fight with a staff , and is trained by x ##ena . [SEP]
[CLS] in the first season , x ##ena and gabrielle meet jo ##x ##er , a comic man who styles himself " jo ##x ##er the magnificent " , and later " jo ##x ##er the mighty . " [SEP]
[CLS] jo ##x ##er ' s goal is to fight for justice , but unfortunately with no physical know - how of his own , he remains the show ' s main comic relief . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , he becomes a close friend to x ##ena and gabrielle . [SEP]
[CLS] in the first season , x ##ena and gabrielle meet two of their biggest enemies : call ##isto ( hudson lei ##ck ) , a ve ##nge ##ful warrior woman , and ares ( kevin tod smith ) , the greek god of war . [SEP]
[CLS] call ##isto is x ##ena ' s arch - enemy and a major antagonist over the course of the series . [SEP]
[CLS] when call ##isto was a child , her home village of ci ##rra was burned nearly to the ground by x ##ena , killing her family . [SEP]
[CLS] she was left trauma ##tized by the attack and eventually went insane , becoming obsessed with exact ##ing revenge on x ##ena . [SEP]
[CLS] she displays a bizarre brand of sad ##istic , glee ##ful , shriek ##ing cruelty towards x ##ena and her associates . [SEP]
[CLS] hercules himself re ##app ##ears alongside io ##laus - who becomes interested in gabrielle - when x ##ena seeks to free prom ##eth ##eus from her ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] ares - su ##ave , charming , witty , yet ruthless and amor ##al - often represents , especially in the early seasons , the seductive power of war and the dark side . [SEP]
[CLS] he repeatedly attempts to lure x ##ena away from her quest for redemption , and tries to win her over as his warrior queen . [SEP]
[CLS] he offers her huge armies and historic victories , great wealth and great power , and in later seasons his love , offers which she consistently rejects despite sometimes being tempted . [SEP]
[CLS] much of his relationship with x ##ena remains , including whether he is at least partly red ##eem ##ed by his love for x ##ena , whether he is in fact her father , and to what extent x ##ena rec ##ip ##ro ##cate ##s his feelings . [SEP]
[CLS] he says several times that he " has a thing " for x ##ena , and he pursue ##s her sexually and romantic ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] this seems to prevent him killing her , even when pitted against her in deadly combat . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , it is suggested that x ##ena has strong feelings for ares , but during the series she is never seen to act on them . [SEP]
[CLS] other major antagonist ##s of the show include caesar and alt ##i , a roman official and shaman ##ess respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] caesar ' s first appearance was in the second - season episode " destiny . " [SEP]
[CLS] he is introduced as a young roman patricia ##n br ##im ##ming with arrogance - so much so , that when he is captured by x ##ena and her pirates he is not afraid . [SEP]
[CLS] when threatened by x ##ena he tells her " " " i know what i ' m fated to do with my life . " " " [SEP]
[CLS] he pretend ##s to let x ##ena seduce him , when in reality she is the one being seduce ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] this ultimately leads to her capture and cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion at his hands , and he orders his men to break her legs - an extremely painful memory which is often revisited during the series . [SEP]
[CLS] caesar ' s betrayal fills her with rage , and is the catalyst for her transition from pirate to warlord . [SEP]
[CLS] alt ##i is an evil shaman ##ess from the northern amazon tribes of siberia , who had been driven out of her tribe because of her hunger for power . [SEP]
[CLS] she is one of the most influential people encountered by x ##ena in her dark days , and possesses a wealth of spiritual powers , including travelling to the spiritual realm . [SEP]
[CLS] alt ##i is probably best known for her trademark " stare , " which brings up pain and suffering from the target ' s life and un ##lea ##sh ##es the torment once again ( in the form of both pain and physical symptoms ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when she " stares " at x ##ena , x ##ena often feels the pain of her legs being broken , her back being snapped , and a cr ##ip ##pling barrage of attacks from her worst enemies . [SEP]
[CLS] as alt ##i grows in power during the series , she can also con ##jure up pain and suffering from a person ' s future , and from their future lives . [SEP]
[CLS] this power back ##fires early in season 4 , when she shows x ##ena a vision from her future , of her and gabrielle being cr ##uc ##ified on mount amar ##ro . [SEP]
[CLS] x ##ena realizes that gabrielle must still be alive , and this gives her the strength to defeat alt ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] over the course of the series , viewers were also introduced to family members of both x ##ena and gabrielle , but most notably featured their children . [SEP]
[CLS] x ##ena gave her first child , a son named sol ##an , to a group of cent ##aur ##s after the death of his father , bo ##ria ##s , who was killed in combat against a warrior in x ##ena ' s employ . [SEP]
[CLS] sol ##an never knew that x ##ena was his mother , however knowing x ##ena for a long time . [SEP]
[CLS] while aiding x ##ena and bo ##udi ##ca to defend britannia against caesar , comes into contact with an evil cult that tricks her into killing one of its priestess ##es , meridian . [SEP]
[CLS] using her , the dark god imp ##re ##gna ##tes gabrielle just as x ##ena rescues her . [SEP]
[CLS] over the next few days the child grows inside gabrielle , and she eventually ( and quite dramatically ) gives birth to a girl , naming her hope . [SEP]
[CLS] even though she is the seed of an evil deity , gabrielle tells x ##ena that she is also a part of her and that there must be some good in her as well . [SEP]
[CLS] being the daughter of da ##hak , she quickly developed supernatural powers , and kills within hours of being born , proving to x ##ena that there was no chance of saving her . [SEP]
[CLS] hope aged amazingly fast , and , mere months after being drifted down a river by her mother , she appeared to be about 9 years old . [SEP]
[CLS] despite gabrielle ' s hopes that she would " be good " , hope killed x ##ena ' s son sol ##an before being poisoned by gabrielle herself . [SEP]
[CLS] during the episode " " , at the end of season 4 , x ##ena and gabrielle were cr ##uc ##ified by the romans , as caesar is betrayed and killed by br ##utus . [SEP]
[CLS] they are later revived by a mystic named eli with the spiritual aid of call ##isto , who by that time had become an angel ; call ##isto also engineers a plan to have x ##ena con ##ce ##ive a daughter after the resurrection , and this child is prop ##hes ##ied to bring about the twilight of the olympian gods ; this girl was named eve . [SEP]
[CLS] to escape the gods ' persecution , x ##ena and gabrielle fake their deaths , but their plan goes aw ##ry when ares bu ##ries them in an ice cave where they sleep for 25 years ; during that time , eve is adopted by the roman nobleman oct ##avi ##us and grows up to become liv ##ia , the champion of rome , and a ruthless per ##se ##cut ##or of eli ' s followers . [SEP]
[CLS] after her return , x ##ena is able to turn liv ##ia to rep ##ent ##ance , and liv ##ia takes back the name eve and becomes the messenger of eli . [SEP]
[CLS] after eve ' s cleansing by baptism , x ##ena is granted the power to kill gods as long as her daughter lives . [SEP]
[CLS] in a final confrontation , the twilight comes to pass when x ##ena kills most of the gods on olympus to save her daughter , and is herself saved by ares when he gives up his immortality to heal the badly injured and dying eve and gabrielle . [SEP]
