In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself.
Euclid also proved a formation rule (IX.36) whereby formula_1 is an even perfect number whenever formula_2 is a prime of the form formula_3 for prime formula_4—what is now called a Mersenne prime.
Two millennia later, Euler proved that all even perfect numbers are of this form.
It is not known whether there are any odd perfect numbers, nor whether infinitely many perfect numbers exist.
The first few perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496 and 8128 (sequence in the OEIS) .
The first four perfect numbers were the only ones known to early Greek mathematics, and the mathematician Nicomachus had noted 8128 as early as 100 AD.
Philo of Alexandria in his first-century book "On the creation" mentions perfect numbers, claiming that the world was created in 6 days and the moon orbits in 28 days because 6 and 28 are perfect.
Philo is followed by Origen, and by Didymus the Blind, who adds the observation that there are only four perfect numbers that are less than 10,000.
St Augustine defines perfect numbers in City of God (Part XI, Chapter 30) in the early 5th century AD, repeating the claim that God created the world in 6 days because 6 is the smallest perfect number.
In a manuscript written between 1456 and 1461, an unknown mathematician recorded the earliest European reference to a fifth perfect number, with 33,550,336 being correctly identified for the first time.
In 1588, the Italian mathematician Pietro Cataldi also identified the sixth (8,589,869,056) and the seventh (137,438,691,328) perfect numbers, and also proved that every perfect number obtained from Euclid's rule ends with a 6 or an 8.
Euclid proved that 2(2 − 1) is an even perfect number whenever 2 − 1 is prime (Elements, Prop.
Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) circa 1000 AD conjectured that every "even" perfect number is of that form.
It was not until the 18th century that Leonhard Euler proved that the formula 2(2 − 1) will yield all the even perfect numbers.
An exhaustive search by the GIMPS distributed computing project has shown that the first 47 even perfect numbers are 2(2 − 1) for Four higher perfect numbers have also been discovered, namely those for which "p" = 57885161, 74207281, 77232917, and 82589933, though there may be others within this range.
s of 2018 , 51 Mersenne primes are known, and therefore 51 even perfect numbers (the largest of which is 2 × (2 − 1) with 49,724,095 digits).
As well as having the form 2(2 − 1), each even perfect number is the (2 − 1)th triangular number (and hence equal to the sum of the integers from 1 to 2 − 1 ) and the 2th hexagonal number.
Even perfect numbers (except 6) are of the form
with each resulting triangular number T = 28, T = 496, T = 8128 (after subtracting 1 from the perfect number and dividing the result by 9) ending in 3 or 5, the sequence starting with T = 3, T = 55, T = 903, 3727815, ...
This can be reformulated as follows: adding the digits of any even perfect number (except 6), then adding the digits of the resulting number, and repeating this process until a single digit (called the digital root) is obtained, always produces the number 1.
Owing to their form, 2(2 − 1), every even perfect number is represented in binary form as "p" ones followed by "p" − 1 zeros; for example, and Thus every even perfect number is a pernicious number.
Note that every even perfect number is also a practical number (c.f.
In 1496, Jacques Lefèvre stated that Euclid's rule gives all perfect numbers, thus implying that no odd perfect number exists.
Euler stated: "Whether (...) there are any odd perfect numbers is a most difficult question".
More recently, Carl Pomerance has presented a heuristic argument suggesting that indeed no odd perfect number should exist.
All perfect numbers are also Ore's harmonic numbers, and it has been conjectured as well that there are no odd Ore's harmonic numbers other than 1.
Furthermore, several minor results are known concerning to the exponents "e", ..., "e" in
All even perfect numbers have a very precise form; odd perfect numbers either do not exist or are rare.
Numbers where the sum is less than the number itself are called deficient, and where it is greater than the number, abundant.
A positive integer such that every smaller positive integer is a sum of distinct divisors of it is a practical number.
A semiperfect number is a natural number that is equal to the sum of all or some of its proper divisors.
A semiperfect number that is equal to the sum of all its proper divisors is a perfect number.
