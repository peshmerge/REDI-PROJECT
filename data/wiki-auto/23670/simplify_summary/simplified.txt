a perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors , excluding the number itself .
for instance , 6 has divisors 1,2 and 3 wagner excluding itselfculus , and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 , so 6 is a perfect number .
the sum of divisors of a number is called its aliquot sum , so a perfect number is one that is equal to its aliquot sum .
a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all its positive divisors including itself .
for instance , 28 is perfect as 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 56 = 2 × 28 .
this is ancient , appearing as early as euclid 's elementscolor vii . 22 ɔ where it is called “ perfect ” , “ ideal ” , or “ complete number ” ” .
euclid also proved a formation rule endings whereby formula _ 1 is an even perfect number whenever formula _ 2 is a prime of the form formula _ 4 for prime formula _ 4 .
two millennia later , euler proved that all even perfect numbers are of this form .
this is known as the euclid – euler theorem .

philo is followed by origen , and by didymus the blind , who says that there are only four perfect numbers that are less than 10,000 .
it was commentary on genesis 1 .

the egyptian mathematician ismail ibn fallus ibn fallusinas -lrb- 1194 – 1252 -rrb- mentioned the next three perfect numbers : 33,550 , 336 ; 8,589 , 869,056 ; and 137,438 , 691,328tou .
in a manuscript written between 1456 and 1461 , an unknown mathematician recorded the earliest european reference to a fifth perfect number , with 33,550 , 336 being correctly identified for the first time .
in 1588 , italian mathematician pietro cataldi also identified the sixthiformis , 869,056dilly , and the seventh litter number obtained from euclid 's rule ends with a 6 or an 8 .
euclid proved that 2 equals 2-1 ⁄ 2 is an even perfect number whenever 2-1 is primeciful elements , prop .
prime numbers of the form 2 − 1 are known as mersenne primes , after the 17th century monk marin mersenne , who studied number theory and perfect numbers .
for 2-1 to be prime , it is necessary that " p " itself be prime .
however , not all numbers of the form 2-1 with a prime " p " are prime .
mersenne primes are very rare , with only 47 of them .
nicomachussive conjectured that every perfect number is of the form 2 skulls 2 buddha-1 ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′
ibn al-haythamtha alhazendilly , a famous mathematician , conjectured that every " even " perfect number is of that form .
leonhard euler proved that the formula 2 skulls 2 − 1 would yield all the even perfect numbers .
each mersenne prime generates one even perfect number , and vice versa .
this result is often referred to as the euclid – euler theorem .
an exhaustive search by the gimps distributed computing project has shown that the first 47 even perfect numbers are 2 − 1 implies for four higher perfect numbers have also been discovered .
as of 2011,51 mersenne primes are known , and therefore 51 even perfect numbers cancel the largest of which is 2 ×ometer 2-1ization with 49,724 , 095 digits digits digits digits digits digits digits digits digits implying .
it is not known whether there are infinitely many perfect numbers , nor whether there are infinitely many mersenne primes .
as well as having the form 2 skulls , each even perfect number is the inconsistent 1-1icative number ; and therefore equal to the sum of the integers from 1 to 2-1 plus the 2th hexagonal number .
even perfect numbers are of the form .
with each resulting triangular number " t = 28 , t = 496 , t = 8128tucket after subtracting 1 from the perfect number and dividing the result by 9 wickets ending in 3 or 5 , the sequence starts with t = 3 , t = 55 , t = 55 , t = 55 , t = 55 , t = 55 , t = 55,3727 , 3727,000 , then adding the resulting digits of the single digits .
for example , the digital root of 8128 is 1 , because 8 + 1 + 2 + 8 = 19,1 + 9 = 10 , and 1 + 0 = 1 .
this works with all perfect numbers 2 × 1icative with odd prime " p " and , in fact , with all numbers of the form 2 − 1 ¥ for odd odd integers .
for example , every even perfect number is a pernicious number .
note that every even perfect number is also a practical number .
it is unknown if there is any odd perfect number , though there have been many results .
in 1496 , jacques lefevre said that euclid 's rule gives all perfect numbers , thus implying that no odd perfect number exists .
euler said : " whether whetherrollerroller . . . . . there are any odd perfect numbers is a most difficult question " .
carl pomerance has presented a heuristic argument .
all perfect numbers are also ore 's harmonic numbers .
for example , several minor results are known about to the exponents " e " , . . , " e " in " e " .
even perfect numbers have a very precise form ; odd perfect numbers are rare .
the sum of proper divisors is a number that can be divided into other kinds .
numbers where the sum is less than the number itself are called deficient .
these terms , together with perfect itself , come from greek numerology .
a pair of numbers are called " sociable " .
a positive integer is a sum of distinct divisors of it .
a perfect number is a fixed point of the restricted divisor function " s " n "arth = " σ " n "arth-" n " ·-" n " n " , and the aliquot sequence associated with a perfect number is a constant sequence .
all perfect numbers are also perfect numbers .
a semiperfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of all or some of its proper divisors .
a semiperfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of all its divisors is a perfect number .
most of the numbers are also semi -perfect .
