[CLS] in number theory , a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive di ##vis ##ors , excluding the number itself . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , 6 has di ##vis ##ors 1 , 2 and 3 ( excluding itself ) , and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 , so 6 is a perfect number . [SEP]
[CLS] the sum of di ##vis ##ors of a number , excluding the number itself , is called its ali ##qu ##ot sum , so a perfect number is one that is equal to its ali ##qu ##ot sum . [SEP]
[CLS] equivalent ##ly , a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive di ##vis ##ors including itself i . e . " σ " ( " n " ) = 2 " n " . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , 28 is perfect as 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 + 28 = 56 = 2 × 28 . [SEP]
[CLS] this definition is ancient , appearing as early as eu ##cl ##id ' s elements ( vii . 22 ) where it is called ( " perfect " , " ideal " , or " complete number " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] eu ##cl ##id also proved a formation rule ( ix . 36 ) whereby formula _ 1 is an even perfect number whenever formula _ 2 is a prime of the form formula _ 3 for prime formula _ 4 — what is now called a mer ##sen ##ne prime . [SEP]
[CLS] two millennia later , eu ##ler proved that all even perfect numbers are of this form . [SEP]
[CLS] this is known as the eu ##cl ##id – eu ##ler theorem . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not known whether there are any odd perfect numbers , nor whether infinitely many perfect numbers exist . [SEP]
[CLS] the first few perfect numbers are 6 , 28 , 49 ##6 and 81 ##28 ( sequence in the o ##eis ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in about 300 bc eu ##cl ##id showed that if 2 − 1 is prime then 2 ( 2 − 1 ) is perfect . [SEP]
[CLS] the first four perfect numbers were the only ones known to early greek mathematics , and the mathematician nico ##mac ##hus had noted 81 ##28 as early as 100 ad . [SEP]
[CLS] phil ##o of alexandria in his first - century book " on the creation " mentions perfect numbers , claiming that the world was created in 6 days and the moon orbits in 28 days because 6 and 28 are perfect . [SEP]
[CLS] phil ##o is followed by or ##igen , and by did ##ym ##us the blind , who adds the observation that there are only four perfect numbers that are less than 10 , 000 . [SEP]

[CLS] st augustine defines perfect numbers in city of god ( part xi , chapter 30 ) in the early 5th century ad , repeating the claim that god created the world in 6 days because 6 is the smallest perfect number . [SEP]
[CLS] the egyptian mathematician ismail ibn fall ##us ( 119 ##4 – 125 ##2 ) mentioned the next three perfect numbers ( 33 , 550 , 336 ; 8 , 58 ##9 , 86 ##9 , 05 ##6 ; and 137 , 43 ##8 , 69 ##1 , 328 ) and listed a few more which are now known to be incorrect . [SEP]
[CLS] in a manuscript written between 145 ##6 and 146 ##1 , an unknown mathematician recorded the earliest european reference to a fifth perfect number , with 33 , 550 , 336 being correctly identified for the first time . [SEP]
[CLS] in 158 ##8 , the italian mathematician pietro cat ##aldi also identified the sixth ( 8 , 58 ##9 , 86 ##9 , 05 ##6 ) and the seventh ( 137 , 43 ##8 , 69 ##1 , 328 ) perfect numbers , and also proved that every perfect number obtained from eu ##cl ##id ' s rule ends with a 6 or an 8 . [SEP]
[CLS] eu ##cl ##id proved that 2 ( 2 − 1 ) is an even perfect number whenever 2 − 1 is prime ( elements , prop . [SEP]
[CLS] prime numbers of the form 2 − 1 are known as mer ##sen ##ne prime ##s , after the seventeenth - century monk marin mer ##sen ##ne , who studied number theory and perfect numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] for 2 − 1 to be prime , it is necessary that " p " itself be prime . [SEP]
[CLS] however , not all numbers of the form 2 − 1 with a prime " p " are prime ; for example , 2 − 1 = 204 ##7 = 23 × 89 is not a prime number . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , mer ##sen ##ne prime ##s are very rare — of the 2 , 610 , 94 ##4 prime numbers " p " up to 43 , 112 , 60 ##9 , 2 − 1 is prime for only 47 of them . [SEP]
[CLS] nico ##mac ##hus ( 60 – 120 ad ) conjecture ##d that every perfect number is of the form 2 ( 2 − 1 ) where 2 − 1 is prime . [SEP]
[CLS] ibn al - hay ##tham ( al ##ha ##zen ) circa 1000 ad conjecture ##d that every " even " perfect number is of that form . [SEP]
[CLS] it was not until the 18th century that leon ##hard eu ##ler proved that the formula 2 ( 2 − 1 ) will yield all the even perfect numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , there is a one - to - one correspondence between even perfect numbers and mer ##sen ##ne prime ##s ; each mer ##sen ##ne prime generates one even perfect number , and vice versa . [SEP]
[CLS] this result is often referred to as the eu ##cl ##id – eu ##ler theorem . [SEP]
[CLS] an exhaust ##ive search by the gi ##mps distributed computing project has shown that the first 47 even perfect numbers are 2 ( 2 − 1 ) for four higher perfect numbers have also been discovered , namely those for which " p " = 57 ##8 ##85 ##16 ##1 , 74 ##20 ##7 ##28 ##1 , 77 ##23 ##29 ##17 , and 82 ##58 ##9 ##9 ##33 , though there may be others within this range . [SEP]
[CLS] s of 2018 , 51 mer ##sen ##ne prime ##s are known , and therefore 51 even perfect numbers ( the largest of which is 2 × ( 2 − 1 ) with 49 , 72 ##4 , 09 ##5 digits ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not known whether there are infinitely many perfect numbers , nor whether there are infinitely many mer ##sen ##ne prime ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] as well as having the form 2 ( 2 − 1 ) , each even perfect number is the ( 2 − 1 ) th triangular number ( and hence equal to the sum of the integers from 1 to 2 − 1 ) and the 2 ##th he ##xa ##gonal number . [SEP]
[CLS] even perfect numbers ( except 6 ) are of the form [SEP]
[CLS] with each resulting triangular number t = 28 , t = 49 ##6 , t = 81 ##28 ( after sub ##tra ##cting 1 from the perfect number and dividing the result by 9 ) ending in 3 or 5 , the sequence starting with t = 3 , t = 55 , t = 90 ##3 , 37 ##27 ##8 ##15 , . . . this can be reform ##ulated as follows : adding the digits of any even perfect number ( except 6 ) , then adding the digits of the resulting number , and repeating this process until a single digit ( called the digital root ) is obtained , always produces the number 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the digital root of 81 ##28 is 1 , because 8 + 1 + 2 + 8 = 19 , 1 + 9 = 10 , and 1 + 0 = 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] this works with all perfect numbers 2 ( 2 − 1 ) with odd prime " p " and , in fact , with all numbers of the form 2 ( 2 − 1 ) for odd integer ( not necessarily prime ) " m " . [SEP]
[CLS] owing to their form , 2 ( 2 − 1 ) , every even perfect number is represented in binary form as " p " ones followed by " p " − 1 zero ##s ; for example , and thus every even perfect number is a per ##nic ##ious number . [SEP]
[CLS] note that every even perfect number is also a practical number ( c . f . related concepts ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it is unknown whether there is any odd perfect number , though various results have been obtained . [SEP]
[CLS] in 149 ##6 , jacques le ##fe ##vre stated that eu ##cl ##id ' s rule gives all perfect numbers , thus implying that no odd perfect number exists . [SEP]
[CLS] eu ##ler stated : " whether ( . . . ) there are any odd perfect numbers is a most difficult question " . [SEP]
[CLS] more recently , carl po ##mer ##ance has presented a he ##uri ##stic argument suggesting that indeed no odd perfect number should exist . [SEP]
[CLS] all perfect numbers are also ore ' s harmonic numbers , and it has been conjecture ##d as well that there are no odd ore ' s harmonic numbers other than 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , several minor results are known concerning to the expo ##nent ##s " e " , . . . , " e " in [SEP]
[CLS] all even perfect numbers have a very precise form ; odd perfect numbers either do not exist or are rare . [SEP]
[CLS] the sum of proper di ##vis ##ors gives various other kinds of numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] numbers where the sum is less than the number itself are called def ##icient , and where it is greater than the number , abundant . [SEP]
[CLS] these terms , together with " perfect " itself , come from greek nu ##mer ##ology . [SEP]
[CLS] a pair of numbers which are the sum of each other ' s proper di ##vis ##ors are called ami ##cable , and larger cycles of numbers are called soc ##iable . [SEP]
[CLS] a positive integer such that every smaller positive integer is a sum of distinct di ##vis ##ors of it is a practical number . [SEP]
[CLS] by definition , a perfect number is a fixed point of the restricted di ##vis ##or function " s " ( " n " ) = " σ " ( " n " ) − " n " , and the ali ##qu ##ot sequence associated with a perfect number is a constant sequence . [SEP]
[CLS] all perfect numbers are also formula _ 22 - perfect numbers , or granville numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] a semi ##per ##fect number is a natural number that is equal to the sum of all or some of its proper di ##vis ##ors . [SEP]
[CLS] a semi ##per ##fect number that is equal to the sum of all its proper di ##vis ##ors is a perfect number . [SEP]
[CLS] most abundant numbers are also semi ##per ##fect ; abundant numbers which are not semi ##per ##fect are called weird numbers . [SEP]
