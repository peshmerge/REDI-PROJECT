in chemistry , an alkalinity is a basic , ionic salt of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal chemical element .
an alkali is a base that dissolves in water .
a solution of a soluble base has a ph greater than 7.0 .
alkaline is commonly , and alkalescent less often , used in english as a synonym for basic , especially for bases soluble in water .
this broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the definition of a base , and they are among the most common bases .
the word " alkali " is derived from arabic " al qaliy " , meaning " the calcined ashes " .
a water-extract of burned plant ashes was mildly basic .
after heating this substance with calcium hydroxide blew up a much more basic substance called " caustic potash " .
caustic potash was traditionally used with animal fats to make soaps .
it gave potassium its chemical symbol k [mask] from the german name kaliumgarh .
alkalis are all arrhenius bases .
the terms " base " and " alkali " are often used interchangeably , particularly outside the context of chemistry and chemical engineering .
there are many different kinds of alkali .
alkalis are usually defined as a subset of the bases .
one of the two subsets is commonly chosen .
the second subset of bases is also called an arrhenius base .
soils with ph values that are higher than 7.3 are usually defined as being alkaline .
these soils can occur naturally .
although many plants do prefer slightly basic soilomorphic like cabbage and fodder like buffalo grasshoppers , most plants prefer a mildly acidic soil containing phs between 6.0 and 6.8 sqft , and alkaline soils can cause problems .
in alkali lakes discharge evaporation concentrates the naturally occurring carbonate salts , giving rise to an alkalic and often saline lake .
