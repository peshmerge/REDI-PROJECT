[CLS] in chemistry , an al ##kali ( ; from arabic : " al - q ##aly " " ashes of the salt ##wo ##rt " ) is a basic , ionic salt of an al ##kali metal or al ##kali ##ne earth metal chemical element . [SEP]
[CLS] an al ##kali also can be defined as a base that dissolve ##s in water . [SEP]
[CLS] a solution of a soluble base has a ph greater than 7 . 0 . [SEP]
[CLS] the adjective al ##kali ##ne is commonly , and al ##kal ##es ##cent less often , used in english as a synonym for basic , especially for bases soluble in water . [SEP]
[CLS] this broad use of the term is likely to have come about because al ##kali ##s were the first bases known to obey the ar ##rh ##eni ##us definition of a base , and they are still among the most common bases . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " al ##kali " is derived from arabic " al q ##ali ##y " ( or " al ##kali " ) , meaning " the cal ##cine ##d ashes " ( see cal ##cina ##tion ) , referring to the original source of al ##kali ##ne substances . [SEP]
[CLS] a water - extract of burned plant ashes , called pot ##ash and composed mostly of potassium carbonate , was mildly basic . [SEP]
[CLS] after heating this substance with calcium hydro ##xide ( " sl ##ake ##d lime " ) , a far more strongly basic substance known as " ca ##ust ##ic pot ##ash " ( potassium hydro ##xide ) was produced . [SEP]
[CLS] ca ##ust ##ic pot ##ash was traditionally used in conjunction with animal fat ##s to produce soft soap ##s , one of the ca ##ust ##ic processes that rendered soap ##s from fat ##s in the process of sap ##oni ##fication , one known since antiquity . [SEP]
[CLS] plant pot ##ash lent the name to the element potassium , which was first derived from ca ##ust ##ic pot ##ash , and also gave potassium its chemical symbol k ( from the german name kali ##um ) , which ultimately derived from al ##kali . [SEP]
[CLS] al ##kali ##s are all ar ##rh ##eni ##us bases , ones which form hydro ##xide ions ( oh ) when dissolved in water . [SEP]
[CLS] the terms " base " and " al ##kali " are often used interchange ##ably , particularly outside the context of chemistry and chemical engineering . [SEP]
[CLS] there are various more specific definitions for the concept of an al ##kali . [SEP]
[CLS] al ##kali ##s are usually defined as a subset of the bases . [SEP]
[CLS] one of two subset ##s is commonly chosen . [SEP]
[CLS] the second subset of bases is also called an " ar ##rh ##eni ##us base " . [SEP]
[CLS] soils with ph values that are higher than 7 . 3 are usually defined as being al ##kali ##ne . [SEP]
[CLS] these soils can occur naturally , due to the presence of al ##kali salts . [SEP]
[CLS] although many plants do prefer slightly basic soil ( including vegetables like cabbage and f ##od ##der like buffalo grass ) , most plants prefer a mildly acidic soil ( with ph ##s between 6 . 0 and 6 . 8 ) , and al ##kali ##ne soils can cause problems . [SEP]
[CLS] in al ##kali lakes ( also called " soda lakes " ) , eva ##por ##ation concentrate ##s the naturally occurring carbonate salts , giving rise to an al ##kali ##c and often saline lake . [SEP]
