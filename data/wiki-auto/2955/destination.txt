In chemistry, an alkali is an aqueous (from water) solution with a pH value of more than 7.
The word 'Alkali' comes from the Arabic 'qali' meaning 'from the ashes' since ashes mixed with water used as cleaning products (such as soaps) are made of alkali materials
An alkali is where a base is dissolved in water.
Often it is the salt of an Alkali metal An alkali is the opposite to an acid and can be neutralised (brought down to pH 7) by adding acid.
Like acids, alkalis can be weak or strong, depending on the nature and the concentration of the ionic salt composing it.
The strength of an alkali can be found using universal indicator.
Also like acids, the strength of an alkali is rated using the pH scale.
For example, soap and toothpaste contain weak alkalis, while cleaning products often contain strong ones.
Metal oxides and metal hydroxides are two types of base.
When neutralised (an acid is added) they produce a salt and water.
The type of salt produced depends on the acid and base.
