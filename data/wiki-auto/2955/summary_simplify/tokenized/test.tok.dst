[CLS] in chemistry , an al ##kali ( ; from arabic : " al - q ##aly " " ashes of the salt ##wo ##rt " ) is a basic , ionic salt of an al ##kali metal or al ##kali ##ne earth metal chemical element . [SEP]
[CLS] an al ##kali also can be defined as a base that dissolve ##s in water . [SEP]
[CLS] the adjective al ##kali ##ne is commonly , and al ##kal ##es ##cent less often , used in english as a synonym for basic , especially for bases soluble in water . [SEP]
[CLS] this broad use of the term is likely to have come about because al ##kali ##s were the first bases known to obey the ar ##rh ##eni ##us definition of a base , and they are still among the most common bases . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " al ##kali " is derived from arabic " al q ##ali ##y " ( or " al ##kali " ) , meaning " the cal ##cine ##d ashes " ( see cal ##cina ##tion ) , referring to the original source of al ##kali ##ne substances . [SEP]
[CLS] a water - extract of burned plant ashes , called pot ##ash and composed mostly of potassium carbonate , was mildly basic . [SEP]
[CLS] plant pot ##ash lent the name to the element potassium , which was first derived from ca ##ust ##ic pot ##ash , and also gave potassium its chemical symbol k ( from the german name kali ##um ) , which ultimately derived from al ##kali . [SEP]
[CLS] the second subset of bases is also called an " ar ##rh ##eni ##us base " . [SEP]
[CLS] soils with ph values that are higher than 7 . 3 are usually defined as being al ##kali ##ne . [SEP]
[CLS] these soils can occur naturally , due to the presence of al ##kali salts . [SEP]
[CLS] although many plants do prefer slightly basic soil ( including vegetables like cabbage and f ##od ##der like buffalo grass ) , most plants prefer a mildly acidic soil ( with ph ##s between 6 . 0 and 6 . 8 ) , and al ##kali ##ne soils can cause problems . [SEP]
