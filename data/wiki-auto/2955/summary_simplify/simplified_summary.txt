in chemistry , an alkalinity is a basic , ionic salt of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal chemical element .
an alkali is a base that dissolves in water .
alkaline is commonly , and alkalescent less often , used in english as a synonym for basic , especially for bases soluble in water .
this broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the definition of a base , and they are among the most common bases .
the word " alkali " is derived from arabic " al qaliy " , meaning " the calcined ashes " .
a water-extract of burned plant ashes was mildly basic .
it gave potassium its chemical symbol k [mask] from the german name kaliumgarh .
the second subset of bases is also called an arrhenius base .
soils with ph values that are higher than 7.3 are usually defined as being alkaline .
these soils can occur naturally .
although many plants do prefer slightly basic soilomorphic like cabbage and fodder like buffalo grasshoppers , most plants prefer a mildly acidic soil containing phs between 6.0 and 6.8 sqft , and alkaline soils can cause problems .
