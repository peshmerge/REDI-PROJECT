[CLS] five - card draw ( also known as a can ##tre ##ll draw ) is a poker variant that is considered the simplest variant of poker , and is the basis for video poker . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , it is often the first variant learned by new players . [SEP]
[CLS] the variant is also offered by some online venues , although it is not as popular as other variants such as seven - card stud and texas hold ' em . [SEP]
[CLS] in casino play the first betting round begins with the player to the left of the big blind , and subsequent rounds begin with the player to the dealer ' s left . [SEP]
[CLS] home games typically use an ant ##e ; the first betting round begins with the player to the dealer ' s left , and the second round begins with the player who opened the first round . [SEP]
[CLS] play begins with each player being dealt five cards , one at a time , all face down . [SEP]
[CLS] the remaining deck is placed aside , often protected by placing a chip or other marker on it . [SEP]
[CLS] players pick up the cards and hold them in their hands , being careful to keep them concealed from the other players , then a round of betting occurs . [SEP]
[CLS] the deck is retrieved , and each player is dealt in turn from the deck the same number of cards they discarded so that each player again has five cards . [SEP]
[CLS] a second " after the draw " betting round occurs beginning with the player to the dealer ' s left or else beginning with the player who opened the first round ( the latter is common when ant ##es are used instead of blinds ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a common " house rule " in some places is that a player may not replace more than three cards , unless they draw four cards while keeping an ace ( or wild card ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in more serious games such as those played in casinos it is unnecessary and generally not used . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a rule used by many casinos is that a player is not allowed to draw five consecutive cards from the deck . [SEP]
[CLS] in this case , if a player wishes to replace all five of their cards , that player is given four of them in turn , the other players are given their draws , and then the dealer returns to that player to give the fifth replacement card ; if no other player draws it is necessary to deal a burn card first . [SEP]
[CLS] another common house rule is that the bottom card of the deck is never given as a replacement , to avoid the possibility of someone who might have seen it during the deal using that information . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , if the last player to draw wants three replacements but there are only two cards remaining in the deck , the dealer gives the player the one top card he can give , then shuffle ##s together the bottom card of the deck , the burn card , and the earlier players ' disc ##ards ( but not the player ' s own disc ##ards ) , and finally deals two more replacements to the last player . [SEP]
[CLS] the sample deal is being played by four players as shown to the right with alice dealing . [SEP]
[CLS] alice retrieve ##s the deck , deals a burn card , then deals three cards directly to bob , who puts them in his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] david disc ##ards one card , and alice deals one card to him from the deck . [SEP]
[CLS] alice now disc ##ards three of her own cards , and replaces them with three from the top of the deck ( note : in a player - dealt casino game there is often a rule that the dealer must disc ##ard before picking up the deck , but this is a home game so we won ' t worry about such details ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when four or fewer players play , a normal 32 - card deck without joker ##s , with ranks ranging from ace to seven , is used . [SEP]
[CLS] many smaller online poker rooms , such as boss media , spread the variant , although it is un ##heard of in land casinos . [SEP]
