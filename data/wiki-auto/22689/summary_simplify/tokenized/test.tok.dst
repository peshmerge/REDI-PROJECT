[CLS] an on ##co ##gen ##e is a gene that has the potential to cause cancer . [SEP]
[CLS] activated on ##co ##gen ##es can cause those cells designated for ap ##op ##tosis to survive and pro ##life ##rate instead . [SEP]
[CLS] if normal genes promoting cellular growth , through mutation , are up - regulated ( gain - of - function mutation ) , they will pre ##dis ##pose the cell to cancer and are thus termed on ##co ##gen ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] many cancer drugs target the proteins encoded by on ##co ##gen ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] later on the term " on ##co ##gen ##e " was rediscovered in 1969 by national cancer institute scientists george tod ##aro and robert he ##ub ##ner . [SEP]
[CLS] experiments performed by dr . g . steve martin of the university of california , berkeley demonstrated that the sar ##com ##a was indeed the on ##co ##gen ##e of the virus . [SEP]
[CLS] dominique ste ##hel ##in , j . michael bishop and harold e . var ##mus of the university of california , san francisco demonstrated that on ##co ##gen ##es were activated proto - on ##co ##gen ##es , found in many organisms including humans . [SEP]
[CLS] bishop and var ##mus were awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in 1989 for their discovery of the cellular origin of retro ##vira ##l on ##co ##gen ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] the resultant protein encoded by an on ##co ##gen ##e is termed on ##co ##pro ##tein . [SEP]
[CLS] on ##co ##gen ##es play an important role in the regulation or synthesis of proteins linked to tumor ##igen ##ic cell growth . [SEP]
[CLS] his discovery was published in the prestigious journal nature in 1982 in an article titled " a point mutation is responsible for the acquisition of transforming properties by the t ##24 human bladder - car ##cino ##ma on ##co ##gen ##e " . [SEP]
[CLS] he spent the following months extending his research , eventually discovering that such on ##co ##gen ##e was the mutation of an all ##ele of the ras subfamily , as well as its activation mechanism . [SEP]
[CLS] a proto - on ##co ##gen ##e is a normal gene that could become an on ##co ##gen ##e due to mutations or increased expression . [SEP]
[CLS] proto - on ##co ##gen ##es code for proteins that help to regulate the cell growth and differentiation . [SEP]
[CLS] proto - on ##co ##gen ##es are often involved in signal trans ##duction and execution of mit ##ogenic signals , usually through their protein products . [SEP]
[CLS] the my ##c gene is implicated in bu ##rk ##itt ' s l ##ym ##ph ##oma , which starts when a ch ##rom ##osomal trans ##lo ##cation moves an enhance ##r sequence within the vicinity of the my ##c gene . [SEP]
[CLS] the my ##c gene codes for widely used transcription factors . [SEP]
[CLS] when the enhance ##r sequence is wrongly placed , these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates . [SEP]
[CLS] another example of an on ##co ##gen ##e is the bc ##r - ab ##l gene found on the philadelphia chromosome , a piece of genetic material seen in chronic my ##elo ##gen ##ous leukemia caused by the trans ##lo ##cation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22 . [SEP]
[CLS] ( more information about the philadelphia chromosome below ) [SEP]
[CLS] the proto - on ##co ##gen ##e can become an on ##co ##gen ##e by a relatively small modification of its original function . [SEP]
[CLS] the expression of on ##co ##gen ##es can be regulated by micro ##rna ##s ( mir ##nas ) , small rna ##s 21 - 25 nu ##cle ##otide ##s in length that control gene expression by down ##re ##gul ##ating them . [SEP]
[CLS] there are several systems for classify ##ing on ##co ##gen ##es , but there is not yet a widely accepted standard . [SEP]
