[CLS] he is considered the most important spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries and throughout his long career was a commentator and chronicle ##r of his era . [SEP]
[CLS] immensely successful in his lifetime , go ##ya is often referred to as both the last of the old masters and the first of the modern ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] he married josef ##a bay ##eu in 1773 ; their life was characterised by an almost constant series of pre ##gnan ##cies and mis ##carriage ##s , and only one child , a son , survived into adulthood . [SEP]
[CLS] he was appointed director of the royal academy in 1795 , the year manuel god ##oy made an un ##fa ##vor ##able treaty with france . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late 1790 ##s , commissioned by god ##oy , he completed his " la maj ##a des ##nu ##da " , a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly ind ##eb ##ted to diego ve ##la ##zquez . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya remained in madrid during the war which seems to have affected him deeply . [SEP]
[CLS] other works from his mid - period include the " cap ##rich ##os " and " los di ##spar ##ates " etc ##hing series , and a wide variety of paintings concerned with insanity , mental asylum ##s , witches , fantastic ##al creatures and religious and political corruption , all of which suggest that he feared for both his country ' s fate and his own mental and physical health . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya eventually abandoned spain in 1824 to retire to the french city of bordeaux , accompanied by his much younger maid and companion , leo ##ca ##dia weiss , who may or may not have been his lover . [SEP]
[CLS] following a stroke which left him paralyzed on his right side , and suffering failing eyes ##ight and poor access to painting materials , he died and was buried on 16 april 1828 aged 82 . [SEP]
[CLS] he oversaw the gil ##ding and most of the or ##name ##ntation during the rebuilding of the basilica of our lady of the pillar ( " santa maria del pi ##lar " ) , the principal cathedral of zaragoza . [SEP]
[CLS] his mother ' s family had pre ##tension ##s of nobility and the house , a modest brick cottage , was owned by her family and , perhaps fan ##ciful ##ly , bore their crest . [SEP]
[CLS] about 1749 jose and gr ##ac ##ia bought a home in zaragoza and were able to return to live in the city . [SEP]
[CLS] although there are no surviving records it is thought that go ##ya may have attended the es ##cu ##ela ##s pia ##s de san anton , which offered free schooling . [SEP]
[CLS] according to robert hughes the artist " seems to have taken no more interest than a carpenter in philosophical or theological matters , and his views on painting . . . were very down to earth : go ##ya was no theo ##ret ##icia ##n . " [SEP]
[CLS] at school he formed a close and lifelong friendship with fellow pupil martin za ##pate ##r ; the 131 letters go ##ya wrote to him from 1775 until za ##pate ##r ' s death in 1801 give valuable insight into go ##ya ' s early years at the court in madrid . [SEP]
[CLS] at age 14 go ##ya studied under the painter jose luz ##an , where he copied stamps for 4 years until he decided to work on his own , as he wrote later on " paint from my invention " . [SEP]
[CLS] having failed to earn a scholarship , go ##ya relocated at his own expense to rome in the old tradition of european artists stretching back at least to albrecht du ##rer . [SEP]
[CLS] early biographer ##s have him travelling to rome with a gang of bull ##fighter ##s , where he worked as a street ac ##ro ##bat , or for a russian diplomat , or fell in love with beautiful young nun whom he plotted to abd ##uc ##t from her convent . [SEP]
[CLS] that year he returned to zaragoza and painted elements of the cup ##ola ##s of the basilica of the pillar ( including " ad ##oration of the name of god " ) , a cycle of frescoes for the monastic church of the charter ##house of au ##la dei , and the frescoes of the sob ##rad ##iel palace . [SEP]
[CLS] he studied with the aragon ##ese artist francisco bay ##eu y sub ##ias and his painting began to show signs of the delicate ton ##ali ##ties for which he became famous . [SEP]
[CLS] he befriended francisco bay ##eu , and married his sister josef ##a ( he nicknamed her " pep ##a " ) on 25 july 1773 . [SEP]
[CLS] the marriage and francisco bay ##eu ' s 1765 membership of the real academia de bella ##s arte ##s de san fernando and directors ##hip of the tapestry works from 1777 helped go ##ya earn a commission for a series of tapestry cartoons for the royal tapestry factory . [SEP]
[CLS] over five years he designed some 42 patterns , many of which were used to decorate and ins ##ulate the stone walls of el es ##cor ##ial and the pal ##acio real del par ##do , the residences of the spanish monarchs . [SEP]
[CLS] while designing tapes ##tries was neither prestigious nor well paid , his cartoons are mostly popular ##ist in a roc ##oco style , and go ##ya used them to bring himself to wider attention . [SEP]
[CLS] the cartoons were not his only royal commissions , and were accompanied by a series of engravings , mostly copies after old masters such as marc ##anto ##nio rai ##mond ##i and ve ##la ##zquez . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya had a complicated relationship to the latter artist ; while many of his contemporaries saw folly in go ##ya ' s attempts to copy and em ##ulate him , he had access to a wide range of the long - dead painter ' s works that had been contained in the royal collection . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , etc ##hing was a medium that the young artist was to master , a medium that was to reveal both the true depths of his imagination and his political beliefs . [SEP]
[CLS] his c . 1779 etc ##hing of " the ga ##rro ##tted man " ( " el ag ##ar ##rot ##ado " ) was the largest work he had produced to date , and an obvious fore ##bo ##ding of his later " disasters of war " series . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the larger cartoons , such as " the wedding " , were more than 8 by 10 feet , and had proved a drain on his physical strength . [SEP]
[CLS] ever resource ##ful , go ##ya turned this mis ##fort ##une around , claiming that his illness had allowed him the insight to produce works that were more personal and informal . [SEP]
[CLS] however , he found the format limiting , as it did not allow him to capture complex color shifts or texture , and was un ##suit ##ed to the imp ##ast ##o and g ##la ##zing techniques he was by then applying to his painted works . [SEP]
[CLS] other works from the period include a canvas for the altar of the church of san francisco el grande in madrid , which led to his appointment as a member of the royal academy of fine art . [SEP]
[CLS] he became friends with the king ' s half - brother luis , and spent two summers working on portraits of both the infant ##e and his family . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1780 ##s , his circle of patrons grew to include the duke and duchess of os ##una , the king and other notable people of the kingdom whom he painted . [SEP]
[CLS] from the back left of the painting one can see the artist himself looking out at the viewer , and the painting behind the family depicts lot and his daughters , thus once again echoing the underlying message of corruption and decay . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya earned commissions from the highest ranks of the spanish nobility , including pedro tell ##ez - giro ##n , 9th duke of os ##una and his wife maria josef ##a pi ##ment ##el , 12th countess - duchess of ben ##ave ##nte , maria del pi ##lar de silva , 13th duchess of alba ( universally known simply as the " duchess of alba " ) , and her husband jose maria alvarez de toledo , 15th duke of medina sid ##onia , and maria ana de pont ##ej ##os y sand ##ova ##l , march ##ion ##ess of pont ##ej ##os . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1801 he painted god ##oy in a commission to commemorate the victory in the brief war of the orange ##s against portugal . [SEP]
[CLS] god ##oy saw himself as instrumental in the publication of the cap ##rich ##os and is widely believed to have commissioned " la maj ##a des ##nu ##da " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1808 all god ##oy ' s property was seized by ferdinand vii after his fall from power and exile , and in 1813 the inquisition confiscated both works as ' obscene ' , returning them in 1836 to the academy of fine arts of san fernando . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1798 he painted luminous and air ##y scenes for the pen ##dent ##ives and cup ##ola of the real er ##mit ##a ( chapel ) of san antonio de la florida in madrid . [SEP]
[CLS] many of these depict miracles of saint anthony of padua set in the midst of contemporary madrid . [SEP]
[CLS] he began the series of aqua ##tin ##ted etc ##hing ##s , published in 1799 as the " cap ##rich ##os " — completed in parallel with the more official commissions of portraits and religious paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1799 go ##ya published 80 " cap ##rich ##os " prints depicting what he described as " the inn ##ume ##rable f ##oi ##bles and f ##oll ##ies to be found in any civilized society , and from the common prejudice ##s and dec ##eit ##ful practices which custom , ignorance , or self - interest have made usual " . [SEP]
[CLS] yet these are not solely bleak ; they demonstrate the artist ' s sharp satirical wit , particularly evident in etc ##hing ##s such as " hunting for teeth " . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya ' s physical and mental breakdown seems to have happened a few weeks after the french declaration of war on spain . [SEP]
[CLS] a contemporary reported , " the noises in his head and deaf ##ness aren ’ t improving , yet his vision is much better and he is back in control of his balance . " [SEP]
[CLS] these symptoms may indicate a prolonged viral en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is , or possibly a series of miniature strokes resulting from high blood pressure and which affected the hearing and balance centers of the brain . [SEP]
[CLS] it is possible that go ##ya suffered from cumulative lead poisoning , as he used massive amounts of lead white — which he ground himself — in his paintings , both as a canvas prime ##r and as a primary color . [SEP]
[CLS] other post ##mo ##rte ##m diagnostic assessments point toward paranoid dementia , possibly due to brain trauma , as evidenced by marked changes in his work after his recovery , culminating in the " black " paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] art historians have noted go ##ya ' s singular ability to express his personal demons as horrific and fantastic imagery that speaks universally , and allows his audience to find its own cat ##har ##sis in the images . [SEP]
[CLS] the extent of go ##ya ' s involvement with the court of the " intruder king " , joseph i , the brother of napoleon bonaparte , is not known ; he painted works for french patrons and sy ##mp ##athi ##ser ##s , but kept neutral during the fighting . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time of his wife josef ##a ' s death in 1812 , he was painting " the second of may 1808 " and " the third of may 1808 " , and preparing the series of etc ##hing ##s later known as " the disasters of war " ( " los des ##ast ##res de la guerra " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the artist completed portraits of the king for a variety of ministries , but not for the king himself . [SEP]
[CLS] while con ##vale ##sc ##ing between 1793 – 1794 , go ##ya completed a set of eleven small pictures painted on tin that mark a significant change in the tone and subject matter of his art , and draw from the dark and dramatic realms of fantasy nightmare . [SEP]
[CLS] the condemnation of brutality towards prisoners ( whether criminal or insane ) is a subject that go ##ya ass ##ay ##ed in later works that focused on the degradation of the human figure . [SEP]
[CLS] it was one of the first of go ##ya ' s mid - 1790 ##s cabinet paintings , in which his earlier search for ideal beauty gave way to an examination of the relationship between natural ##ism and fantasy that would pre ##oc ##cup ##y him for the rest of his career . [SEP]
[CLS] he was undergoing a nervous breakdown and entering prolonged physical illness , and admitted that the series was created to reflect his own self - doubt , anxiety and fear that he was losing his mind . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya wrote that the works served " to occupy my imagination , tormented as it is by con ##tem ##pl ##ation of my suffering ##s . " [SEP]
[CLS] the series , he said , consisted of pictures which " normally find no place in commissioned works . " [SEP]
[CLS] although go ##ya did not make his intention known when creating " the disasters of war " , art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 dos de mayo uprising , the subsequent peninsular war and the move against liberalism in the aftermath of the restoration of the bourbon monarchy in 1814 . [SEP]
[CLS] it is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks critic ##ising both the french and restored bourbon ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the first 47 plates in the series focus on incidents from the war and show the consequences of the conflict on individual soldiers and civilians . [SEP]
[CLS] the final 17 reflect the bitter disappointment of liberals when the restored bourbon monarchy , encouraged by the catholic hierarchy , rejected the spanish constitution of 1812 and opposed both state and religious reform . [SEP]
[CLS] since their first publication , go ##ya ' s scenes of atrocities , starvation , degradation and humiliation have been described as the " pro ##di ##gio ##us flowering of rage " . [SEP]
[CLS] his works from 1814 to 1819 are mostly commissioned portraits , but also include the altar ##piece of santa just ##a and santa ru ##fin ##a for the cathedral of seville , the print series of " la tau ##rom ##aq ##ui ##a " depicting scenes from bull ##fighting , and probably the etc ##hing ##s of " los di ##spar ##ates " . [SEP]
[CLS] tormented by a dread of old age and fear of madness , the latter possibly from anxiety caused by an und ##ia ##gno ##sed illness that left him deaf from the early 1790 ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] from the late 1810 ##s he lived in near - solitude outside madrid in a farmhouse converted into a studio . [SEP]
[CLS] the house had become known as " la qui ##nta del so ##rdo " ( the house of the deaf man ) , after the nearest farmhouse that had coincidentally also belonged to a deaf man . [SEP]
[CLS] art historians assume go ##ya felt alien ##ated from the social and political trends that followed the 1814 restoration of the bourbon monarchy , and that he viewed these developments as reaction ##ary means of social control . [SEP]
[CLS] in his unpublished art he seems to have rail ##ed against what he saw as a tactical retreat into medieval ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] it is thought that he had hoped for political and religious reform , but like many liberals became di ##sil ##lusion ##ed when the restored bourbon monarchy and catholic hierarchy rejected the spanish constitution of 1812 . [SEP]
[CLS] at the age of 75 , alone and in mental and physical despair , he completed the work of his 14 " black paintings " , all of which were executed in oil directly onto the plaster walls of his house . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya did not intend for the paintings to be exhibited , did not write of them , and likely never spoke of them . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the works were significantly altered during the restoration , and in the words of arthur lu ##bow what remain are " at best a crude fa ##cs ##imi ##le of what go ##ya painted . " [SEP]
[CLS] the effects of time on the murals , coupled with the inevitable damage caused by the delicate operation of mounting the crumbling plaster on canvas , meant that most of the murals suffered extensive damage and loss of paint . [SEP]
[CLS] leo ##ca ##dia weiss ( nee z ##or ##rill ##a , 1790 – 1856 ) the artist ' s maid , younger by 35 years , and a distant relative , lived with and cared for go ##ya after bay ##eu ' s death . [SEP]
[CLS] leo ##ca ##dia was probably similar in features to go ##ya ' s first wife josef ##a bay ##eu , to the point that one of his well - known portraits bears the cautious title of " josef ##a bay ##eu ( or leo ##ca ##dia weiss ) " . [SEP]
[CLS] it is known that leo ##ca ##dia had an unhappy marriage with a jewel ##er , is ##ide ##o weiss , but was separated from him since 1811 . [SEP]
[CLS] she wrote to a number of go ##ya ' s friends to complain of her exclusion but many of her friends were go ##ya ' s also and by then were old men or had died , and did not reply . [SEP]
[CLS] largely des ##ti ##tute , she moved into rented accommodation , later passing on her copy of the " cap ##rich ##os " for free . [SEP]
