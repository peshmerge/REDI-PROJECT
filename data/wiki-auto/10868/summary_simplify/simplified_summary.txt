in the late 1790s , commissioned by godoy , he completed his " la maja desnuda " , a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly indebted to diego velazquez .

in about 1749 , he bought a home in zaragoza and were able to live in the city .
there are no records it is thought that goya may have attended the escuelas pias de san anton .
according to robert hughes , the artist " seems to have taken no more interest than a carpenter in philosophical or theological matters , and his views on painting . . were very down to earth : goya was no theoretician . "

he was married to his sister josefaailing .
the marriage and francisco bayeu 's 1765 membership of the real academia de bellas artes de san fernando and directorship of the tapestry works from 1777 helped goya earn a commission for a series of tapestry cartoons for the royal tapestry factory .
he designed some 42 patterns , many of which were used to decorate and insulate the stone walls of el escorial and the palacio real del pardo , the residences of the spanish monarchs .
while designing tapestries was neither well paid nor well , his cartoons are mostly popularist in a rococo style , and goya used them to bring himself to wider attention .
the series of engravings were made of many different kinds of engravings , mostly copies after old masters such as marcantonio raimondi and velazquez .
goya had a complicated relationship with the latter artist ; while many of his contemporaries saw folly in goya 's attempts to copy and look like him , he had access to a wide range of the long-dead painter 's works that had been contained in the royal collection .
nonetheless , etching was a medium that the young artist was to master .
his c . 1779 etching of " the garrotting man " exploded at the end of the war series .
some of the larger cartoons , such as " the wedding " , were more than eight by 10 feet , and had proved a drain on his physical strength .
ever resourceful , goya turned this misfortune around , saying that his illness had allowed him to produce works that were more personal and informal .
he was not able to capture complex color shifts or texture .
he was appointed a member of the royal academy of fine art .
he became friends with the king 's half-brother luis .
during the 1780s , his circle of patrons grew to include the duke and duchess of osuna , the king and other notable people of the kingdom whom he painted .

many of these depict miracles of saint anthony of padua set in the midst of contemporary madrid .
he began the series of aquatinted etchings , published in 1799 as the " caprichos " .
in 1799 goya published 80 " caprichos " prints showing what he described as " the innumerable foibles and follies to be found in any civilized society , and from the common prejudices and deceitful practices which custom , ignorance , or self-interest have made usual " .
yet these are not solely bleak ; they show the artist 's sharp satirical wit , particularly evident in etchings such as " hunting for teeth " .
goya 's physical and mental breakdown seems to have happened a few weeks after the french declaration of war on spain .
a contemporary report , " the noises in his head and deafness aren ’ t improving , yet his vision is much better and he is back in control of his balance . "
these symptoms may indicate a prolonged viral encephalitis , or possibly a series of small strokes resulting from high blood pressure and which affected the hearing and balance centres of the brain .
goya suffered from cumulative lead poisoning , as he used massive amounts of lead white in his paintings , both as a canvas primer and as a primary color .
other postmortem diagnostic assessments point toward paranoid dementia , possibly due to brain trauma , as shown by marked changes in his work after his recovery , culminating in the " black " paintings .
art historians have noted goya 's singular ability to express his personal demons as horrific and fantastic imagery that speaks universally , and allows his audience to find its own catharsis in the images .
goya 's involvement with the court of the " intruder king " , joseph i , the brother of napoleon bonaparte , is not known .
by the time of his wife josefa 's death in 1812 , he was painting " the second of may 1808 " and " the third of may 1808 " .
the artist completed portraits of the king for a variety of ministries , but not for the king himself .
goya completed a set of eleven small pictures painted on tin .
the condemnation of brutality towards prisonerstify whether criminal or insane tchaikovsky is a subject that goya assayed in later works .
it was one of goya 's cabinet paintings .
he was having a nervous breakdown and entering a long-illness .
goya said that the works served " to occupy my imagination , tormented as it is by contemplation of my sufferings . "
he said , " normally find no place in commissioned works . "
art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 dos de mayo uprising , the subsequent peninsular war and the move against liberalism in the aftermath of the restoration of the bourbon monarchy in 1814 .
it is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to get a sequence of artworks criticising both the french and restored bourbons .
the first 47 plates in the series show the consequences of the conflict on individual soldiers and civilians .
the final 17 reflect the bitter disappointment of liberals when the restored bourbon monarchy , encouraged by the catholic hierarchy , rejected the spanish constitution of 1812 .
since their first publication , goya 's scenes of atrocities , starvation , degradation and humiliation have been described as the " prodigious flowering of rage " .
his works from 1814 to 1819 are mostly commissioned portraits , but also include the altarpiece of santa justa and santa rufina for the cathedral of seville .
he was tormented by a dread of old age and fear of madness .
from the late 1810s he lived in near-solitude outside madrid in a farmhouse became a studio .
the house had become known as " la quinta del sordo " opener the house of the deaf mandilly .
art historians assume goya felt alienated from the social and political trends that followed the 1814 restoration of the bourbon monarchy .
in his unpublished art he seems to have railed against what he saw as a tactical retreat into medievalism .
like many liberals became disillusioned when the restored bourbon monarchy and catholic hierarchy rejected the spanish constitution of 1812 .
all of his 14 " black paintings " were painted in oil directly onto the plaster walls of his house .
goya did not intend for the paintings to be shown , and did not write of them , and likely never spoke of them .
many of the works were changed during the restoration .
the effects of time on the murals , and with the inevitable damage caused by the delicate operation of mounting the plaster on canvas , meant that most of the murals suffered extensive damage and loss of paint .
leocadia weissoons -lrb- 1790 – 1856 -rrb- lived with and cared for goya after bayeu 's death .
leocadia was probably similar in features to goya 's first wife josefa bayeu .
it is known that leocadia had an unhappy marriage with a jeweler , but was separated from him since 1811 .
she wrote to a number of goya 's friends to complain about her exclusion but many of her friends were goya 's also and by then were old men or had died , and did not reply .
she later passed on her copy of the " caprichos " for free .
