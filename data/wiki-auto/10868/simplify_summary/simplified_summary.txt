although letters and writings survive , little is known about his thoughts .
in 1795 , he was appointed director of the royal academy .
in the late 1790s , commissioned by godoy , he completed his " la maja desnuda " , a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly indebted to diego velazquez .
goya stayed in madrid during the war which seems to have affected him deeply .
although he did not vocalise his thoughts in public , they can be inferred from his " disasters of war " series of prints parapets .
other works from his mid-period include the " caprichos " and " los disparates " series , and a wide variety of paintings concerned with insanity , mental asylums , witches , fantastical creatures and religious and political corruption .

he had reading , writing and numeracy , and some knowledge of the classics .
according to robert hughes , the artist " seems to have taken no more interest than a carpenter in philosophical or theological matters , and his views on painting . . were very down to earth : goya was no theoretician . "
he moved to madrid to study with anton raphael mengs .
he clashed with his master , and his examinations were not very good .
rome was then the cultural capital of europe and held all the prototypes of classical antiquity , while spain lacked a coherent artistic direction , with all of its significant visual achievements in the past .

their first child , antonio juan ramon carlos , was born on 29 august 1774 .
the marriage and francisco bayeu 's 1765 membership of the real academia de bellas artes de san fernando and directorship of the tapestry works from 1777 helped goya earn a commission for a series of tapestry cartoons for the royal tapestry factory .
he designed some 42 patterns , many of which were used to decorate and insulate the stone walls of el escorial and the palacio real del pardo , the residences of the spanish monarchs .
while designing tapestries was neither well paid nor well , his cartoons are mostly popularist in a rococo style , and goya used them to bring himself to wider attention .
the series of engravings were made of many different kinds of engravings , mostly copies after old masters such as marcantonio raimondi and velazquez .
goya had a complicated relationship with the latter artist ; while many of his contemporaries saw folly in goya 's attempts to copy and look like him , he had access to a wide range of the long-dead painter 's works that had been contained in the royal collection .
nonetheless , etching was a medium that the young artist was to master .
his c . 1779 etching of " the garrotting man " exploded at the end of the war series .
some of the larger cartoons , such as " the wedding " , were more than eight by 10 feet , and had proved a drain on his physical strength .

in 1801 he painted godoy in a commission to commemorate the victory in the brief war of the oranges against portugal .
the two were friends , even if goya 's " 1801 portrait " is usually seen as satire .
in 1798 he painted luminous and airy scenes for the pendentives and cupola of the real ermita nedra chapel chapel chapelholders of san antonio de la florida in madrid .
many of these depict miracles of saint anthony of padua set in the midst of contemporary madrid .
in 1799 goya published 80 " caprichos " prints showing what he described as " the innumerable foibles and follies to be found in any civilized society , and from the common prejudices and deceitful practices which custom , ignorance , or self-interest have made usual " .
yet these are not solely bleak ; they show the artist 's sharp satirical wit , particularly evident in etchings such as " hunting for teeth " .
goya 's physical and mental breakdown seems to have happened a few weeks after the french declaration of war on spain .
a contemporary report , " the noises in his head and deafness aren â€™ t improving , yet his vision is much better and he is back in control of his balance . "
these symptoms may indicate a prolonged viral encephalitis , or possibly a series of small strokes resulting from high blood pressure and which affected the hearing and balance centres of the brain .
goya suffered from cumulative lead poisoning , as he used massive amounts of lead white in his paintings , both as a canvas primer and as a primary color .
other postmortem diagnostic assessments point toward paranoid dementia , possibly due to brain trauma , as shown by marked changes in his work after his recovery , culminating in the " black " paintings .
art historians have noted goya 's singular ability to express his personal demons as horrific and fantastic imagery that speaks universally , and allows his audience to find its own catharsis in the images .
the french army invaded spain in 1808 .

the artist completed portraits of the king for a variety of ministries , but not for the king himself .
the condemnation of brutality towards prisonerstify whether criminal or insane tchaikovsky is a subject that goya assayed in later works .
goya said that the works served " to occupy my imagination , tormented as it is by contemplation of my sufferings . "
art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 dos de mayo uprising , the subsequent peninsular war and the move against liberalism in the aftermath of the restoration of the bourbon monarchy in 1814 .
the scenes are singularly disturbing , sometimes macabre in their depiction of battlefield horror .
it is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to get a sequence of artworks criticising both the french and restored bourbons .
the first 47 plates in the series show the consequences of the conflict on individual soldiers and civilians .
the final 17 reflect the bitter disappointment of liberals when the restored bourbon monarchy , encouraged by the catholic hierarchy , rejected the spanish constitution of 1812 .
since their first publication , goya 's scenes of atrocities , starvation , degradation and humiliation have been described as the " prodigious flowering of rage " .
his works from 1814 to 1819 are mostly commissioned portraits , but also include the altarpiece of santa justa and santa rufina for the cathedral of seville .
records of goya 's later life are relatively scant , and ever politically aware , he suppressed a number of his works from this period , working instead in private .

from the late 1810s he lived in near-solitude outside madrid in a farmhouse became a studio .
the house had become known as " la quinta del sordo " opener the house of the deaf mandilly .

in his unpublished art he seems to have railed against what he saw as a tactical retreat into medievalism .
like many liberals became disillusioned when the restored bourbon monarchy and catholic hierarchy rejected the spanish constitution of 1812 .
all of his 14 " black paintings " were painted in oil directly onto the plaster walls of his house .
goya did not intend for the paintings to be shown , and did not write of them , and likely never spoke of them .
around 1874,50 years after his death , they were taken down and moved to canvas support .
the effects of time on the murals , and with the inevitable damage caused by the delicate operation of mounting the plaster on canvas , meant that most of the murals suffered extensive damage and loss of paint .
today they are on permanent display at the museo del prado , madrid .
not much is known about her beyond her fiery temper .
it is known that leocadia had an unhappy marriage with a jeweler , but was separated from him since 1811 .
her husband cited " illicit conduct " during the divorce proceedings .
there has been much speculation that goya and weiss were romantically linked .
