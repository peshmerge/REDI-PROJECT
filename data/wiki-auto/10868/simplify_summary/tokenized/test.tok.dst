[CLS] francisco jose de go ##ya y lucien ##tes ( ; 11 ##p ##x | listen ] ] } } ; 30 march 1746 – 16 april 1828 ) was a spanish romantic painter and print ##maker . [SEP]
[CLS] he is considered the most important spanish artist of the late 18th and early 19th centuries and throughout his long career was a commentator and chronicle ##r of his era . [SEP]
[CLS] immensely successful in his lifetime , go ##ya is often referred to as both the last of the old masters and the first of the modern ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] he was also one of the great contemporary portrait ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya was born to a lower middle class family in 1746 , in the village of fu ##end ##eto ##dos in aragon . [SEP]
[CLS] he studied painting from age 14 under jose luz ##an y martinez and moved to madrid to study with anton raphael meng ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] he married josef ##a bay ##eu in 1773 ; their life was characterised by an almost constant series of pre ##gnan ##cies and mis ##carriage ##s , and only one child , a son , survived into adulthood . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya became a court painter to the spanish crown in 1786 and this early portion of his career is marked by portraits of the spanish aristocracy and royalty , and roc ##oco style tapestry cartoons designed for the royal palace . [SEP]
[CLS] he was guarded , and although letters and writings survive , little is known about his thoughts . [SEP]
[CLS] he suffered a severe and und ##ia ##gno ##sed illness in 1793 which left him deaf . [SEP]
[CLS] sick and di ##sil ##lusion ##ed , after 1793 his work became progressively darker and pe ##ssi ##mist ##ic . [SEP]
[CLS] his later ease ##l and mural paintings , prints and drawings appear to reflect a bleak outlook on personal , social and political levels , and contrast with his social climbing . [SEP]
[CLS] he was appointed director of the royal academy in 1795 , the year manuel god ##oy made an un ##fa ##vor ##able treaty with france . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1799 go ##ya became prime ##r pinto ##r de cam ##ara , the highest rank for a spanish court painter . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late 1790 ##s , commissioned by god ##oy , he completed his " la maj ##a des ##nu ##da " , a remarkably daring nude for the time and clearly ind ##eb ##ted to diego ve ##la ##zquez . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1801 he painted " charles iv of spain and his family " , also influenced by ve ##la ##zquez . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1807 napoleon led the french army into the peninsular war against spain . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya remained in madrid during the war which seems to have affected him deeply . [SEP]
[CLS] although he did not vocal ##ise his thoughts in public , they can be in ##fer ##red from his " disasters of war " series of prints ( although published 35 years after his death ) and his 1814 paintings " the second of may 1808 " and " the third of may 1808 " . [SEP]
[CLS] other works from his mid - period include the " cap ##rich ##os " and " los di ##spar ##ates " etc ##hing series , and a wide variety of paintings concerned with insanity , mental asylum ##s , witches , fantastic ##al creatures and religious and political corruption , all of which suggest that he feared for both his country ' s fate and his own mental and physical health . [SEP]
[CLS] his late period cu ##lm ##inates with the " black paintings " of 1819 – 1823 , applied on oil on the plaster walls of his house the qui ##nta del so ##rdo ( " house of the deaf man " ) where , di ##sil ##lusion ##ed by political and social developments in spain he lived in near isolation . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya eventually abandoned spain in 1824 to retire to the french city of bordeaux , accompanied by his much younger maid and companion , leo ##ca ##dia weiss , who may or may not have been his lover . [SEP]
[CLS] there he completed his " la tau ##rom ##aq ##ui ##a " series and a number of other , major , canvas ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] following a stroke which left him paralyzed on his right side , and suffering failing eyes ##ight and poor access to painting materials , he died and was buried on 16 april 1828 aged 82 . [SEP]
[CLS] his body was later re - interred in the real er ##mit ##a de san antonio de la florida in madrid . [SEP]
[CLS] famously , the skull was missing , a detail the spanish consul immediately communicated to his superiors in madrid , who wired back , " send go ##ya , with or without head . " [SEP]
[CLS] francisco go ##ya was born in fu ##end ##eto ##dos , aragon , spain , on 30 march 1746 to jose benito de go ##ya y fran ##que and gr ##ac ##ia de lucien ##tes y salvador . [SEP]
[CLS] the family had moved that year from the city of zaragoza , but there is no record why ; likely jose was commissioned to work there . [SEP]
[CLS] they were lower middle - class . [SEP]
[CLS] jose was the son of a not ##ary and of basque origin , his ancestors being from ze ##rain , earning his living as a gil ##der , specialising in religious and decorative craft ##work . [SEP]
[CLS] he oversaw the gil ##ding and most of the or ##name ##ntation during the rebuilding of the basilica of our lady of the pillar ( " santa maria del pi ##lar " ) , the principal cathedral of zaragoza . [SEP]
[CLS] francisco was their fourth child , following his sister rita ( b . 1737 ) , brother tomas ( b . 1739 ) ( who was to follow in his father ' s trade ) and second sister ja ##cin ##ta ( b . 1743 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there were two younger sons , mariano ( b . 1750 ) and cam ##ilo ( b . 1753 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] his mother ' s family had pre ##tension ##s of nobility and the house , a modest brick cottage , was owned by her family and , perhaps fan ##ciful ##ly , bore their crest . [SEP]
[CLS] about 1749 jose and gr ##ac ##ia bought a home in zaragoza and were able to return to live in the city . [SEP]
[CLS] although there are no surviving records it is thought that go ##ya may have attended the es ##cu ##ela ##s pia ##s de san anton , which offered free schooling . [SEP]
[CLS] his education seems to have been adequate but not en ##light ##ening ; he had reading , writing and nu ##mer ##acy , and some knowledge of the classics . [SEP]
[CLS] according to robert hughes the artist " seems to have taken no more interest than a carpenter in philosophical or theological matters , and his views on painting . . . were very down to earth : go ##ya was no theo ##ret ##icia ##n . " [SEP]
[CLS] at school he formed a close and lifelong friendship with fellow pupil martin za ##pate ##r ; the 131 letters go ##ya wrote to him from 1775 until za ##pate ##r ' s death in 1801 give valuable insight into go ##ya ' s early years at the court in madrid . [SEP]
[CLS] at age 14 go ##ya studied under the painter jose luz ##an , where he copied stamps for 4 years until he decided to work on his own , as he wrote later on " paint from my invention " . [SEP]
[CLS] he moved to madrid to study with anton raphael meng ##s , a popular painter with spanish royalty . [SEP]
[CLS] he clashed with his master , and his examinations were un ##sat ##is ##factory . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya submitted entries for the real academia de bella ##s arte ##s de san fernando in 1763 and 1766 , but was denied entrance . [SEP]
[CLS] rome was then the cultural capital of europe and held all the prototypes of classical antiquity , while spain lacked a coherent artistic direction , with all of its significant visual achievements in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] having failed to earn a scholarship , go ##ya relocated at his own expense to rome in the old tradition of european artists stretching back at least to albrecht du ##rer . [SEP]
[CLS] he was an unknown at the time and so the records are scan ##t and uncertain . [SEP]
[CLS] early biographer ##s have him travelling to rome with a gang of bull ##fighter ##s , where he worked as a street ac ##ro ##bat , or for a russian diplomat , or fell in love with beautiful young nun whom he plotted to abd ##uc ##t from her convent . [SEP]
[CLS] what is more certain is two surviving mythological paintings completed during the visit , a " sacrifice to vest ##a " and a " sacrifice to pan " , both dated 1771 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1771 he won second prize in a painting competition organized by the city of parma . [SEP]
[CLS] that year he returned to zaragoza and painted elements of the cup ##ola ##s of the basilica of the pillar ( including " ad ##oration of the name of god " ) , a cycle of frescoes for the monastic church of the charter ##house of au ##la dei , and the frescoes of the sob ##rad ##iel palace . [SEP]
[CLS] he studied with the aragon ##ese artist francisco bay ##eu y sub ##ias and his painting began to show signs of the delicate ton ##ali ##ties for which he became famous . [SEP]
[CLS] he befriended francisco bay ##eu , and married his sister josef ##a ( he nicknamed her " pep ##a " ) on 25 july 1773 . [SEP]
[CLS] their first child , antonio juan ramon carlos , was born on 29 august 1774 . [SEP]
[CLS] the marriage and francisco bay ##eu ' s 1765 membership of the real academia de bella ##s arte ##s de san fernando and directors ##hip of the tapestry works from 1777 helped go ##ya earn a commission for a series of tapestry cartoons for the royal tapestry factory . [SEP]
[CLS] over five years he designed some 42 patterns , many of which were used to decorate and ins ##ulate the stone walls of el es ##cor ##ial and the pal ##acio real del par ##do , the residences of the spanish monarchs . [SEP]
[CLS] while designing tapes ##tries was neither prestigious nor well paid , his cartoons are mostly popular ##ist in a roc ##oco style , and go ##ya used them to bring himself to wider attention . [SEP]
[CLS] the cartoons were not his only royal commissions , and were accompanied by a series of engravings , mostly copies after old masters such as marc ##anto ##nio rai ##mond ##i and ve ##la ##zquez . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya had a complicated relationship to the latter artist ; while many of his contemporaries saw folly in go ##ya ' s attempts to copy and em ##ulate him , he had access to a wide range of the long - dead painter ' s works that had been contained in the royal collection . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , etc ##hing was a medium that the young artist was to master , a medium that was to reveal both the true depths of his imagination and his political beliefs . [SEP]
[CLS] his c . 1779 etc ##hing of " the ga ##rro ##tted man " ( " el ag ##ar ##rot ##ado " ) was the largest work he had produced to date , and an obvious fore ##bo ##ding of his later " disasters of war " series . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya was be ##set by illness , and his condition was used against him by his rivals , who looked jealous ##ly upon any artist seen to be rising in stature . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the larger cartoons , such as " the wedding " , were more than 8 by 10 feet , and had proved a drain on his physical strength . [SEP]
[CLS] ever resource ##ful , go ##ya turned this mis ##fort ##une around , claiming that his illness had allowed him the insight to produce works that were more personal and informal . [SEP]
[CLS] however , he found the format limiting , as it did not allow him to capture complex color shifts or texture , and was un ##suit ##ed to the imp ##ast ##o and g ##la ##zing techniques he was by then applying to his painted works . [SEP]
[CLS] the tapes ##tries seem as comments on human types , fashion and fa ##ds . [SEP]
[CLS] other works from the period include a canvas for the altar of the church of san francisco el grande in madrid , which led to his appointment as a member of the royal academy of fine art . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1783 , the count of florida ##bla ##nca , favorite of king charles iii , commissioned go ##ya to paint his portrait . [SEP]
[CLS] he became friends with the king ' s half - brother luis , and spent two summers working on portraits of both the infant ##e and his family . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1780 ##s , his circle of patrons grew to include the duke and duchess of os ##una , the king and other notable people of the kingdom whom he painted . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1786 , go ##ya was given a sal ##ari ##ed position as painter to charles iii . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya was appointed court painter to charles iv in 1789 . [SEP]
[CLS] the following year he became first court painter , with a salary of 50 , 000 real ##es and an allowance of 500 duc ##ats for a coach . [SEP]
[CLS] he painted portraits of the king and the queen , and the spanish prime minister manuel de god ##oy and many other nobles . [SEP]
[CLS] these portraits are notable for their di ##sin ##cl ##ination to flat ##ter ; his " charles iv of spain and his family " is an especially brutal assessment of a royal family . [SEP]
[CLS] modern interpreter ##s view the portrait as satirical ; it is thought to reveal the corruption behind the rule of charles iv . [SEP]
[CLS] under his reign his wife louisa was thought to have had the real power , and thus go ##ya placed her at the center of the group portrait . [SEP]
[CLS] from the back left of the painting one can see the artist himself looking out at the viewer , and the painting behind the family depicts lot and his daughters , thus once again echoing the underlying message of corruption and decay . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya earned commissions from the highest ranks of the spanish nobility , including pedro tell ##ez - giro ##n , 9th duke of os ##una and his wife maria josef ##a pi ##ment ##el , 12th countess - duchess of ben ##ave ##nte , maria del pi ##lar de silva , 13th duchess of alba ( universally known simply as the " duchess of alba " ) , and her husband jose maria alvarez de toledo , 15th duke of medina sid ##onia , and maria ana de pont ##ej ##os y sand ##ova ##l , march ##ion ##ess of pont ##ej ##os . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1801 he painted god ##oy in a commission to commemorate the victory in the brief war of the orange ##s against portugal . [SEP]
[CLS] the two were friends , even if go ##ya ' s " 1801 portrait " is usually seen as satire . [SEP]
[CLS] yet even after god ##oy ' s fall from grace the politician referred to the artist in warm terms . [SEP]
[CLS] god ##oy saw himself as instrumental in the publication of the cap ##rich ##os and is widely believed to have commissioned " la maj ##a des ##nu ##da " . [SEP]
[CLS] " la maj ##a des ##nu ##da " ( " la maj ##a des ##nu ##da " ) has been described as " the first totally prof ##ane life - size female nude in western art " without pre ##tens ##e to all ##egorical or mythological meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] the identity of the " maj ##as " is uncertain . [SEP]
[CLS] the most popularly cited models are the duchess of alba , with whom go ##ya was sometimes thought to have had an affair , and pep ##ita tu ##do , mistress of manuel de god ##oy . [SEP]
[CLS] neither theory has been verified , and it remains as likely that the paintings represent an ideal ##ized composite . [SEP]
[CLS] the paintings were never publicly exhibited during go ##ya ' s lifetime and were owned by god ##oy . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1808 all god ##oy ' s property was seized by ferdinand vii after his fall from power and exile , and in 1813 the inquisition confiscated both works as ' obscene ' , returning them in 1836 to the academy of fine arts of san fernando . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1798 he painted luminous and air ##y scenes for the pen ##dent ##ives and cup ##ola of the real er ##mit ##a ( chapel ) of san antonio de la florida in madrid . [SEP]
[CLS] many of these depict miracles of saint anthony of padua set in the midst of contemporary madrid . [SEP]
[CLS] at some time between late 1792 and early 1793 an und ##ia ##gno ##sed illness left go ##ya deaf . [SEP]
[CLS] he became withdrawn and intro ##sp ##ect ##ive while the direction and tone of his work changed . [SEP]
[CLS] he began the series of aqua ##tin ##ted etc ##hing ##s , published in 1799 as the " cap ##rich ##os " — completed in parallel with the more official commissions of portraits and religious paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1799 go ##ya published 80 " cap ##rich ##os " prints depicting what he described as " the inn ##ume ##rable f ##oi ##bles and f ##oll ##ies to be found in any civilized society , and from the common prejudice ##s and dec ##eit ##ful practices which custom , ignorance , or self - interest have made usual " . [SEP]
[CLS] the visions in these prints are partly explained by the capt ##ion " the sleep of reason produces monsters " . [SEP]
[CLS] yet these are not solely bleak ; they demonstrate the artist ' s sharp satirical wit , particularly evident in etc ##hing ##s such as " hunting for teeth " . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya ' s physical and mental breakdown seems to have happened a few weeks after the french declaration of war on spain . [SEP]
[CLS] a contemporary reported , " the noises in his head and deaf ##ness aren ’ t improving , yet his vision is much better and he is back in control of his balance . " [SEP]
[CLS] these symptoms may indicate a prolonged viral en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is , or possibly a series of miniature strokes resulting from high blood pressure and which affected the hearing and balance centers of the brain . [SEP]
[CLS] symptoms of tin ##ni ##tus , episodes of im ##balance and progressive deaf ##ness are typical of men ##iere ' s disease . [SEP]
[CLS] it is possible that go ##ya suffered from cumulative lead poisoning , as he used massive amounts of lead white — which he ground himself — in his paintings , both as a canvas prime ##r and as a primary color . [SEP]
[CLS] other post ##mo ##rte ##m diagnostic assessments point toward paranoid dementia , possibly due to brain trauma , as evidenced by marked changes in his work after his recovery , culminating in the " black " paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] art historians have noted go ##ya ' s singular ability to express his personal demons as horrific and fantastic imagery that speaks universally , and allows his audience to find its own cat ##har ##sis in the images . [SEP]
[CLS] the french army invaded spain in 1808 , leading to the peninsular war of 1808 – 1814 . [SEP]
[CLS] the extent of go ##ya ' s involvement with the court of the " intruder king " , joseph i , the brother of napoleon bonaparte , is not known ; he painted works for french patrons and sy ##mp ##athi ##ser ##s , but kept neutral during the fighting . [SEP]
[CLS] after the restoration of the spanish king ferdinand vii in 1814 , go ##ya denied any involvement with the french . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time of his wife josef ##a ' s death in 1812 , he was painting " the second of may 1808 " and " the third of may 1808 " , and preparing the series of etc ##hing ##s later known as " the disasters of war " ( " los des ##ast ##res de la guerra " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] ferdinand vii returned to spain in 1814 but relations with go ##ya were not cord ##ial . [SEP]
[CLS] the artist completed portraits of the king for a variety of ministries , but not for the king himself . [SEP]
[CLS] while con ##vale ##sc ##ing between 1793 – 1794 , go ##ya completed a set of eleven small pictures painted on tin that mark a significant change in the tone and subject matter of his art , and draw from the dark and dramatic realms of fantasy nightmare . [SEP]
[CLS] " yard with lunatic ##s " is an imaginary vision of loneliness , fear and social alien ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] the condemnation of brutality towards prisoners ( whether criminal or insane ) is a subject that go ##ya ass ##ay ##ed in later works that focused on the degradation of the human figure . [SEP]
[CLS] it was one of the first of go ##ya ' s mid - 1790 ##s cabinet paintings , in which his earlier search for ideal beauty gave way to an examination of the relationship between natural ##ism and fantasy that would pre ##oc ##cup ##y him for the rest of his career . [SEP]
[CLS] he was undergoing a nervous breakdown and entering prolonged physical illness , and admitted that the series was created to reflect his own self - doubt , anxiety and fear that he was losing his mind . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya wrote that the works served " to occupy my imagination , tormented as it is by con ##tem ##pl ##ation of my suffering ##s . " [SEP]
[CLS] the series , he said , consisted of pictures which " normally find no place in commissioned works . " [SEP]
[CLS] although go ##ya did not make his intention known when creating " the disasters of war " , art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 dos de mayo uprising , the subsequent peninsular war and the move against liberalism in the aftermath of the restoration of the bourbon monarchy in 1814 . [SEP]
[CLS] the scenes are singular ##ly disturbing , sometimes mac ##ab ##re in their depiction of battlefield horror , and represent an outraged conscience in the face of death and destruction . [SEP]
[CLS] they were not published until 1863 , 35 years after his death . [SEP]
[CLS] it is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks critic ##ising both the french and restored bourbon ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the first 47 plates in the series focus on incidents from the war and show the consequences of the conflict on individual soldiers and civilians . [SEP]
[CLS] the middle series ( plates 48 to 64 ) record the effects of the famine that hit madrid in 1811 – 12 , before the city was liberated from the french . [SEP]
[CLS] the final 17 reflect the bitter disappointment of liberals when the restored bourbon monarchy , encouraged by the catholic hierarchy , rejected the spanish constitution of 1812 and opposed both state and religious reform . [SEP]
[CLS] since their first publication , go ##ya ' s scenes of atrocities , starvation , degradation and humiliation have been described as the " pro ##di ##gio ##us flowering of rage " . [SEP]
[CLS] his works from 1814 to 1819 are mostly commissioned portraits , but also include the altar ##piece of santa just ##a and santa ru ##fin ##a for the cathedral of seville , the print series of " la tau ##rom ##aq ##ui ##a " depicting scenes from bull ##fighting , and probably the etc ##hing ##s of " los di ##spar ##ates " . [SEP]
[CLS] records of go ##ya ' s later life are relatively scan ##t , and ever politically aware , he suppressed a number of his works from this period , working instead in private . [SEP]
[CLS] tormented by a dread of old age and fear of madness , the latter possibly from anxiety caused by an und ##ia ##gno ##sed illness that left him deaf from the early 1790 ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya had been a successful and royal ##ly placed artist , but withdrew from public life during his final years . [SEP]
[CLS] from the late 1810 ##s he lived in near - solitude outside madrid in a farmhouse converted into a studio . [SEP]
[CLS] the house had become known as " la qui ##nta del so ##rdo " ( the house of the deaf man ) , after the nearest farmhouse that had coincidentally also belonged to a deaf man . [SEP]
[CLS] art historians assume go ##ya felt alien ##ated from the social and political trends that followed the 1814 restoration of the bourbon monarchy , and that he viewed these developments as reaction ##ary means of social control . [SEP]
[CLS] in his unpublished art he seems to have rail ##ed against what he saw as a tactical retreat into medieval ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] it is thought that he had hoped for political and religious reform , but like many liberals became di ##sil ##lusion ##ed when the restored bourbon monarchy and catholic hierarchy rejected the spanish constitution of 1812 . [SEP]
[CLS] at the age of 75 , alone and in mental and physical despair , he completed the work of his 14 " black paintings " , all of which were executed in oil directly onto the plaster walls of his house . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya did not intend for the paintings to be exhibited , did not write of them , and likely never spoke of them . [SEP]
[CLS] around 1874 , 50 years after his death , they were taken down and transferred to a canvas support . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the works were significantly altered during the restoration , and in the words of arthur lu ##bow what remain are " at best a crude fa ##cs ##imi ##le of what go ##ya painted . " [SEP]
[CLS] the effects of time on the murals , coupled with the inevitable damage caused by the delicate operation of mounting the crumbling plaster on canvas , meant that most of the murals suffered extensive damage and loss of paint . [SEP]
[CLS] today they are on permanent display at the museo del pr ##ado , madrid . [SEP]
[CLS] leo ##ca ##dia weiss ( nee z ##or ##rill ##a , 1790 – 1856 ) the artist ' s maid , younger by 35 years , and a distant relative , lived with and cared for go ##ya after bay ##eu ' s death . [SEP]
[CLS] she stayed with him in his qui ##nta del so ##rdo villa until 1824 with her daughter rosario . [SEP]
[CLS] leo ##ca ##dia was probably similar in features to go ##ya ' s first wife josef ##a bay ##eu , to the point that one of his well - known portraits bears the cautious title of " josef ##a bay ##eu ( or leo ##ca ##dia weiss ) " . [SEP]
[CLS] not much is known about her beyond her fiery temperament . [SEP]
[CLS] she was likely related to the go ##ico ##eche ##a family , a wealthy dynasty into which the artist ' s son , the fe ##ckle ##ss javier , had married . [SEP]
[CLS] it is believed she held liberal political views and was una ##fra ##id of expressing them , a fact met with disapproval by go ##ya ' s family . [SEP]
[CLS] it is known that leo ##ca ##dia had an unhappy marriage with a jewel ##er , is ##ide ##o weiss , but was separated from him since 1811 . [SEP]
[CLS] her husband cited " illicit conduct " during the divorce proceedings . [SEP]
[CLS] she had two children before the marriage dissolved , and bore a third , rosario , in 1814 when she was 26 . [SEP]
[CLS] is ##ide ##o was not the father , and it has often been speculated — although with little firm evidence — that the child belonged to go ##ya . [SEP]
[CLS] there has been much speculation that go ##ya and weiss were romantic ##ally linked ; however , it is more likely the affection between them was sentimental . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##ya died on 16 april 1828 . [SEP]
[CLS] leo ##ca ##dia was left nothing in go ##ya ' s will ; mistress ##es were often omitted in such circumstances , but it is also likely that he did not want to dwell on his mortality by thinking about or rev ##ising his will . [SEP]
[CLS] she wrote to a number of go ##ya ' s friends to complain of her exclusion but many of her friends were go ##ya ' s also and by then were old men or had died , and did not reply . [SEP]
[CLS] largely des ##ti ##tute , she moved into rented accommodation , later passing on her copy of the " cap ##rich ##os " for free . [SEP]
