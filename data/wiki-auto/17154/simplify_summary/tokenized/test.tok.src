[CLS] thomas young and his family had a family tradition to celebrate christmas by annually having a party at their fashionable home in houston ##ville . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to their own family , the carson ##s would always invite friends and close neighbors . [SEP]
[CLS] it was to this occasion that lindsay and rebecca carson were invited . [SEP]
[CLS] lindsay ' s wife , rebecca was expecting the imminent birth of their 6th child . [SEP]
[CLS] early in the evening , the hostess , mrs . young noticed that rebecca carson seemed to be in some distress and knowing of her expect ##ant child , mrs . young took rebecca to a room in another building where she could be in a more comforting environment and attended by a helpful attendant , a woman who was an african - american slave . [SEP]
[CLS] it was not long until the sound of a new pair of strong lungs sounded out the alarm , a new child had been born to lindsay and rebecca carson . [SEP]
[CLS] the new mother and father decided quickly their son should be named christopher houston carson , and because of his small size , to give him the nick - name , " kit . " [SEP]
[CLS] lindsay carson had a scots - irish presbyterian background . [SEP]
[CLS] he was a farmer , a cabin builder , and a veteran of the american revolutionary war and the war of 1812 . [SEP]

[CLS] their daughter ada ##line became kit ' s favorite play ##mate . [SEP]
[CLS] missouri was then the frontier of american expansion ##ism west ; cabins were " forte ##d " with tall stock ##ade fences to defend against indian attacks . [SEP]
[CLS] as men worked in the fields , sent ##ries were posted with weapons , to protect the farmers . [SEP]
[CLS] these men were ready to kill any indian who attacked . [SEP]
[CLS] < carson wrote in his " memoirs " : " for two or three years after our arrival , we had to remain forte ##d and it was necessary to have men stationed at the ex ##tre ##mit ##ies of the fields for the protection of those that were labor ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1818 lindsay carson died instantly when a tree limb fell on him while he was clearing a field . [SEP]
[CLS] kit was about 8 years old . [SEP]
[CLS] despite being penn ##ile ##ss , his mother took care of her children alone for four years . [SEP]
[CLS] she then married joseph martin , a widow ##er with several children . [SEP]
[CLS] kit was a young teenager at the time and did not get along with his stepfather . [SEP]
[CLS] the decision was made to apprentice him to david work ##man , a saddle ##r in franklin , missouri . [SEP]
[CLS] kit wrote in his " memoirs " that work ##man was " a good man , and i often recall the kind treatment i received . " [SEP]
[CLS] franklin was situated at the eastern end of the santa fe trail , which had opened two years earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the customers at the saddle shop were trap ##pers and traders , from whom carson heard stirring tales of the west . [SEP]
[CLS] carson found work in the saddle ##ry not to his taste : he once stated " the business did not suit me , and i concluded to leave " . [SEP]
[CLS] in august 1826 , against his mother ' s wishes , kit ran away from his apprenticeship . [SEP]
[CLS] he went west with a caravan of fur trap ##pers , tending their livestock . [SEP]
[CLS] they made their trek over the santa fe trail to santa fe , the capital of santa fe de nuevo mexico , reaching their destination in november 1826 . [SEP]
[CLS] kit settled in tao ##s . [SEP]

[CLS] carson was mentor ##ed by kin ##ke ##ad in learning the skills of a trap ##per , while learning the necessary languages for trade . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually he became fluent in spanish and several indian languages . [SEP]
[CLS] work ##man put an advertisement in a local newspaper back in missouri . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote that he would give a one cent reward to anyone who brought the boy back to franklin . [SEP]
[CLS] no one claimed the reward . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a bit of a joke , but carson was free . [SEP]
[CLS] the advertisement featured the first printed description of carson : " christopher carson , a boy about 16 years old , small of his age , but thick set ; light hair , ran away from the sub ##scribe ##r , living in franklin , howard county , missouri , to whom he had been bound to learn the saddle ##r ' s trade . " [SEP]
[CLS] between 1827 and 1829 , carson worked as cook , translator , and wagon driver in the southwest . [SEP]
[CLS] he also worked at a copper mine near the gil ##a river in southwestern new mexico . [SEP]
[CLS] in later life , carson never mentioned any women from his youth . [SEP]
[CLS] there are only three specific women mentioned in his writing : josef ##a jar ##ami ##llo , his third and last wife ; a comrade ' s mother in washington , dc ; and mrs . ann white , a victim of indian atrocities . [SEP]
[CLS] at the age of nineteen , carson began his career as a mountain man . [SEP]
[CLS] he traveled through many parts of the american west with famous mountain men like jim bridge ##r and old bill williams . [SEP]
[CLS] he spent the winter of 1828 – 1829 as a cook for ewing young in tao ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] he joined young ' s trapping expedition of 1829 . [SEP]
[CLS] the leadership of young and the experience of the venture are credited with shaping carson ' s early life in the mountains . [SEP]
[CLS] during august 1829 the party went into apache country along the gil ##a river . [SEP]
[CLS] the expedition was attacked , being carson ' s first experience of combat . [SEP]
[CLS] young ' s party continued on into alta california trapping and trading in california from sacramento in the north to los angeles in the south , returning to tao ##s , new mexico in april 1830 after trapping along the colorado river . [SEP]
[CLS] carson joined a wagon train rescue party after entering tao ##s , and although the perpetrators had fled the scene of atrocities young had the opportunity to witness carson ' s horse ##manship and courage . [SEP]
[CLS] carson joined another expedition led by thomas fitzpatrick and william levin in 1831 . [SEP]
[CLS] fitzpatrick , levin and his trap ##pers went north to the central rocky mountains . [SEP]
[CLS] carson would hunt and trap in the west for about ten years . [SEP]
[CLS] he was known as a reliable man and a good fighter . [SEP]
[CLS] life for carson as a mountain man was not easy . [SEP]
[CLS] after collecting beaver ##s from traps , he had to hold onto them for months at a time until the annual rocky mountain rendezvous , held in remote areas of the west like the banks of the green river in wyoming . [SEP]
[CLS] with the money received for the pe ##lts , nec ##ess ##ities of an independent life including fish hooks , flour and tobacco were pro ##cured . [SEP]
[CLS] as there was little to no medical access in the varied regions he worked in , carson had to dress his wounds and nurse himself . [SEP]
[CLS] conflict with particular indians sometimes occurred . [SEP]
[CLS] carson ' s primary clothing at the time was in deer skins that had stiffened after being left outdoors for a time . [SEP]
[CLS] this suit offered some protection against particular weapons employed by indians . [SEP]
[CLS] gr ##izzly bears were one of the mountain man ' s greatest enemies . [SEP]
[CLS] a particular incident involving the animals happened to carson in 1834 as he was hunting an elk alone . [SEP]
[CLS] two bears crossed paths with him and quickly chased him up a tree . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the bears tried to make him fall by shaking the tree , but was not successful and eventually went away . [SEP]
[CLS] carson returned to his camp as fast as he could . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote in his " memoirs " that : " the bear finally concluded to leave , of which i was heart ##ily pleased , never having been so scared in my life . " [SEP]
[CLS] the last rendezvous was held in 1840 . [SEP]
[CLS] at that time , the fur trade began to drop off . [SEP]
[CLS] fashionable men in london , paris , and new york wanted silk hats instead of beaver hats . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , beaver populations across north america were declining rapidly from over - exploitation . [SEP]
[CLS] carson knew it was time to find other work . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote in his " memoirs " that " beaver was getting scarce , it became necessary to try our hand at something else . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1841 , he was hired at bent ' s fort in colorado , at the largest building on the santa fe trail . [SEP]
[CLS] hundreds of people worked or lived there . [SEP]
[CLS] carson hunted buffalo , ant ##elo ##pe , deer , and other animals to feed these people . [SEP]
[CLS] he was paid one dollar a day . [SEP]
[CLS] he returned to bent ' s fort several times during his life to again provide meat for the fort ' s residents . [SEP]
[CLS] carson was nineteen when he set off with ewing young ' s expedition to the rocky mountains in 1829 . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to fur ##s and the company of free - spirited , rugged mountain men , carson sought action and adventure . [SEP]
[CLS] he found what he was looking for in killing and scalp ##ing indians . [SEP]
[CLS] carson probably killed and took the scalp of his first indian when he was nineteen years old , during ewing young ' s expedition . [SEP]
[CLS] carson ' s " memoirs " are rep ##lete with stories about hostile indian encounters with the memoir ##ist . [SEP]
[CLS] in january 1833 , for example , warriors of the crow tribe stole nine horses from carson ' s camp . [SEP]
[CLS] carson and two other men sprayed the crow camp with gunfire , killing almost every crow . [SEP]
[CLS] carson wrote in his " memoirs " : " during our pursuit for the lost animals , we suffered considerably but , the success of having recovered our horses and sending many a reds ##kin to his long home , our suffering ##s were soon forgotten . " [SEP]
[CLS] carson viewed the black ##foot nation as a hostile tribe , believing they posed the greatest threat to his livelihood , safety , and life . [SEP]
[CLS] he hated the black ##fe ##et , and killed them at every opportunity . [SEP]
[CLS] historian david roberts has written : " it was taken for granted that the black ##fe ##et were bad indians ; to shoot them whenever he could was a mountain man ' s instinct and duty . " [SEP]
[CLS] carson had several encounters with the black ##fe ##et . [SEP]
[CLS] his last battle with the black ##fe ##et took place in spring 1838 . [SEP]
[CLS] he was traveling with about one hundred mountain men led by jim bridge ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] in montana territory , the group found a tee ##pee with three indian corpses inside . [SEP]
[CLS] these three had died of smallpox . [SEP]
[CLS] bridge ##r wanted to move on , but carson and the other young men wanted to kill the black ##fe ##et . [SEP]
[CLS] they found the black ##foot village and killed ten black ##fe ##et warriors . [SEP]
[CLS] the black ##fe ##et found some safety in a pile of rocks but were driven away . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not known how many black ##fe ##et died in this incident . [SEP]
[CLS] historian david roberts writes : " if anything like pity filled carson ' s breast as , in his twenty - ninth year , he be ##held the ravaged camp of the black ##fe ##et , he did not bother to remember it . " [SEP]
[CLS] carson wrote in his " memoirs " that this battle was " the pre ##tti ##est fight i ever saw . " [SEP]
[CLS] carson ' s notions about indians softened over the years . [SEP]
[CLS] he found himself more and more in their company as he grew older and his attitude towards them became more respectful and humane . [SEP]
[CLS] he urged the government to set aside lands called reservations for their use . [SEP]
[CLS] as an indian agent , he saw to it that those under his watch were treated with honesty , fairness , and clothed and fed properly . [SEP]
[CLS] historian david roberts believes his first marriage to an ara ##pa ##ho woman named singing grass " softened the stern and pr ##ag ##matic mountain ##eer ' s op ##port ##uni ##sm . " [SEP]
[CLS] in april 1842 , carson went back to his childhood home in missouri to put his daughter ada ##line in the care of relatives . [SEP]
[CLS] on the return trip , carson met john c . fremont aboard a steamboat on the missouri river . [SEP]
[CLS] fremont was a united states army officer in the corps of topographic ##al engineers . [SEP]
[CLS] he was about to lead an expedition into the west . [SEP]
[CLS] after a brief conversation , fremont hired carson as a guide at $ 100 a month . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the best - paying job of carson ' s life . [SEP]
[CLS] fremont wrote , " i was pleased with him and his manner of address at this first meeting . [SEP]
[CLS] he was a man of medium height , broad - shouldered , and deep - chest ##ed , with a clear steady blue eye and frank speech and address ; quiet and una ##ss ##uming . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1842 , carson guided fremont across the oregon trail to south pass , wyoming . [SEP]
[CLS] this was their first expedition into the west together . [SEP]
[CLS] the purpose of this expedition was to map and describe the oregon trail as far as south pass . [SEP]
[CLS] a guide ##book , maps , and other para ##pher ##nal ##ia would be printed for westward - bound migrants and settlers . [SEP]
[CLS] after the five - month , trouble - free mission was accomplished , fremont wrote his government reports . [SEP]
[CLS] these reports made carson ' s name known across the united states , and spurred a migration of settlers westward to oregon via the oregon trail . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1843 , carson agreed to join fremont ' s second expedition . [SEP]
[CLS] he guided fremont across part of the oregon trail to the columbia river in oregon . [SEP]
[CLS] the purpose of the expedition was to map and describe the oregon trail from south pass , wyoming to the columbia river . [SEP]
[CLS] they also side - tripped to great salt lake in utah , using a rubber raft to navigate the waters . [SEP]
[CLS] on the way to california , the party suffered from bad weather in the sierra nevada mountains , but were saved by carson ' s good judgement and his skills as a guide . [SEP]
[CLS] they found american settlers who fed them . [SEP]
[CLS] the expedition then headed to california . [SEP]
[CLS] this was illegal and dangerous because california was mexican territory . [SEP]
[CLS] the mexican government ordered fremont to leave . [SEP]
[CLS] fremont finally went back to washington , d . c . [SEP]
[CLS] the government liked his reports , but ignored his illegal trip into mexico . [SEP]
[CLS] fremont was made a captain . [SEP]
[CLS] the newspapers nicknamed him " the path ##finder " . [SEP]
[CLS] during this expedition , fremont trek ##ked into the mo ##ja ##ve desert . [SEP]
[CLS] his party met a mexican man and boy . [SEP]
[CLS] the two told carson that native americans had ambushed their party of travelers . [SEP]
[CLS] the male travelers were killed ; the women travelers were stake ##d to the ground , sexually mu ##tila ##ted , and killed . [SEP]
[CLS] the murderers then stole the mexican ##s ' thirty horses . [SEP]
[CLS] carson and a mountain man friend named alexis god ##ey went after the murderers . [SEP]
[CLS] they took two days to find them . [SEP]
[CLS] they rushed into their camp , killing and scalp ##ing two of the murderers . [SEP]
[CLS] the stolen horses were recovered and returned to the mexican man and boy . [SEP]
[CLS] this deed brought carson even greater fame . [SEP]
[CLS] it confirmed his status as a western hero in the eyes of the american people . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1845 , carson guided fremont on their third and last expedition . [SEP]
[CLS] they went to california and oregon . [SEP]
[CLS] fremont made scientific plans , but the expedition appeared to be political in nature . [SEP]
[CLS] fremont may have been working under secret government orders . [SEP]
[CLS] president polk wanted the province of alta california for the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] once in california , fremont started to rouse the american settlers into a patriotic fe ##r ##vor . [SEP]
[CLS] the mexican government ordered him to leave . [SEP]
[CLS] fremont went north to oregon , though not before ins ##ti ##gating the sacramento river massacre , in which at least 150 indians were killed in an un ##pro ##vo ##ked attack . [SEP]
[CLS] the party moved up along the sacramento river , continuing to kill indians as they went , then camped near k ##lam ##ath lake . [SEP]
[CLS] messages from washington , dc made it clear that president polk wanted california . [SEP]
[CLS] at k ##lam ##ath lake in southern oregon , fremont ' s party was hit in a revenge attack by 15 – 20 indians on the night of may 9 , 1846 . [SEP]
[CLS] two or three men in camp were killed . [SEP]
[CLS] the attackers fled after a brief struggle . [SEP]
[CLS] carson was angry that his friends had been killed . [SEP]
[CLS] he took an axe and avenge ##d the death of his friends by chop ##ping away at a dead indian ' s face . [SEP]
[CLS] fremont wrote , " he knocked his head to pieces . " [SEP]
[CLS] in retaliation for the attack , a few days later fremont ' s party massacre ##d a village of k ##lam ##ath people along the williamson river in the k ##lam ##ath lake massacre . [SEP]
[CLS] the entire village was ra ##zed and at least 14 men , women and children were killed . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no evidence that the village in question had anything to do with the previous attack . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 1846 , fremont and carson both participated in a california uprising against mexico called the bear flag revolt . [SEP]
[CLS] mexico ordered all americans to leave california . [SEP]
[CLS] american settlers in california wanted to be free of the mexican government and declared california an independent republic . [SEP]
[CLS] the american rebels found courage to oppose mexico because they had fremont — who had written an oath of allegiance — and his troops behind them . [SEP]
[CLS] fremont and his men were able to give some protection to the americans . [SEP]
[CLS] he ordered carson to execute an old mexican man named jose de los reyes be ##rre ##yes ##a and his two adult nephew ##s , who had been captured when they stepped ashore at san francisco bay , to prevent them from not ##ifying mexico about the uprising . [SEP]
[CLS] fremont worked hard to win california for the united states , for a time fashion ##ing himself as its military governor , until being replaced by general ke ##arney , who out - ranked him . [SEP]
[CLS] carson took military records to the secretary of war in washington , dc . [SEP]
[CLS] fremont wrote , " this was a service of great trust and honor . . . and great danger also . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1847 and 1848 , carson made two quick trips to washington , dc with messages and reports . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1848 , he took news of the california gold strike to the nation ' s capitol . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 1853 , carson was in northern nevada , with 7 , 000 sheep from santa fe . [SEP]
[CLS] he was taking them to settlers in northern california , and southern oregon . [SEP]
[CLS] carson had with him six " spaniards " ( possibly basque ##s ) to herd the sheep . [SEP]
[CLS] carson ' s fame spread throughout the united states with government reports , dime novels , newspaper accounts , and word of mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] the dime novels celebrated carson ' s adventures , but were usually colored with ex ##agger ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] a factual biography was attempted by dew ##itt c . peters in 1859 , but has been criticized for ina ##cc ##ura ##cies and ex ##agger ##ations . [SEP]
[CLS] carson became the hero of juvenile fiction not just in the united states , but also published in french , german , portuguese , gujarati , hindi , singh ##ales ##e , arabic and japanese . [SEP]
[CLS] the first story about carson ' s adventures was printed in 1847 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was called " an adventure of kit carson : a tale of the sacramento " . [SEP]
[CLS] it was printed in " holden ' s dollar magazine " . [SEP]
[CLS] other stories were also printed , such as " kit carson : the prince of the gold ##hunter ##s " and " the prairie flower " . [SEP]
[CLS] writers thought carson the perfect mountain man and indian fighter . [SEP]
[CLS] his exciting adventures were printed in the story " ki ##owa charley , the white mustang ##er ; or , rocky mountain kit ' s last scalp hunt " . [SEP]
[CLS] in this story , an older kit is said to have " ridden into sioux camps una ##tten ##ded and alone , had ridden out again , but with the scalp ##s of their greatest warriors at his belt . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1849 , carson guided soldiers on the trail of mrs . ann white , her baby daughter and " negro servant , " who had been captured by ji ##car ##illa apache ##s and ut ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] the commanding officer , captain william gr ##ier of the 1st cavalry regiment , ignored carson ' s advice about an immediate rescue attempt after catching the ji ##car ##illa ##s unaware , but after a shot was fired , the order was given to attack , by which time the ji ##car ##illa ##s had started to flee . [SEP]
[CLS] as carson describes it in his autobiography : " in about 200 yards , pursuing the indians , the body of mrs . white was found , perfectly warm , had not been killed more than five minutes - shot through the heart by an arrow . . . i am certain that if the indians had been charged immediately on our arrival she would have been saved . " [SEP]
[CLS] her child and servant were taken away by the fleeing ji ##car ##illa ##s and killed shortly after the attack , according to a 1850 report by james s . calhoun , the superintendent of indian affairs in new mexico . [SEP]
[CLS] a soldier in the rescue party wrote : " mrs . white was a frail , delicate , and very beautiful woman , but having undergone such usage as she suffered nothing but a wreck remained ; it was literally covered with blows and scratches . [SEP]
[CLS] her count ##ena ##nce even after death indicated a hopeless creature . [SEP]
[CLS] over her corpse , we swore vengeance upon her per ##se ##cut ##ors . " [SEP]
[CLS] carson discovered a book about himself in the apache camp . [SEP]
[CLS] this was the first time that he found himself in print . [SEP]
[CLS] he was the hero of adventure stories . [SEP]
[CLS] he was sorry for the rest of his life that mrs . white had been killed . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote in his " memoirs " : " in camp was found a book , the first of the kind i had ever seen , in which i was made a great hero , sl ##ay ##ing indians by the hundreds . . . i have often thought that mrs . white read the same . . . and prayed for my appearance that she might be saved . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1856 , carson told his life story to someone who wrote it down . [SEP]
[CLS] this book is called " memoirs " . [SEP]
[CLS] the manuscript was lost when taken east to find a professional writer who would work it into a book . [SEP]
[CLS] washington irving was asked , but declined . [SEP]
[CLS] the lost manuscript was found in a trunk in paris in 1905 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was later printed . [SEP]
[CLS] the first biography of carson was written by dew ##itt c . peters in 1859 . [SEP]
[CLS] the book was called " kit carson , the nestor of the mountains , from facts narrated by himself " . [SEP]
[CLS] when the book was read to carson he said , " peters laid it on a lee ##tle too thick . " [SEP]
[CLS] lasting from 1846 to 1848 , the mexican – american war was an armed conflict between the united states and mexico . [SEP]
[CLS] at war ' s end , mexico was forced to sell the territories of alta california and new mexico to the united states under the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo . [SEP]
[CLS] one of carson ' s best known adventures took place during this war . [SEP]
[CLS] in december 1846 , carson was ordered by general stephen w . ke ##ar ##ny to guide him and his troops from soc ##orro , new mexico to san diego , california . [SEP]
[CLS] mexican soldiers attacked ke ##ar ##ny and his men near the village of san pas ##qual , california . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew he could not win ; he ordered his men to take cover on a small hill . [SEP]
[CLS] on the night of december 8 , carson , a naval lieutenant named beale , and an indian scout left ke ##ar ##ny to bring reinforcements from san diego , 25 mi away . [SEP]
[CLS] carson and the lieutenant removed their shoes because they made too much noise , and walked barefoot through the desert . [SEP]
[CLS] carson wrote in his " memoirs " : " finally got through , but had the mis ##fort ##une to lose our shoes . [SEP]
[CLS] had to travel over a country covered with prick ##ly pear and rocks , barefoot . " [SEP]
[CLS] by december 10 , ke ##ar ##ny believed reinforcements would not arrive . [SEP]
[CLS] he planned to break through the mexican lines the next morning , but 200 mounted american soldiers arrived in san pas ##qual late that night . [SEP]
[CLS] they swept the area , driving the mexican ##s away . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##ar ##ny was in san diego on december 12 . [SEP]
[CLS] in april 1861 , the american civil war broke out . [SEP]
[CLS] carson left his job as an indian agent and joined the union army as a lieutenant . [SEP]
[CLS] he led the 1st new mexico volunteer infantry and trained the new men . [SEP]
[CLS] in october 1861 , he was made a colonel . [SEP]
[CLS] the volunteers fought the confederate forces in the battle of valve ##rde in new mexico , in february 1862 . [SEP]
[CLS] the confederates won this battle but were later defeated in june and retreated to texas . [SEP]
[CLS] once the confederates were driven from new mexico , carson ' s commander major general james henry carleton turned his attention to the native americans . [SEP]
[CLS] author and historian edwin sa ##bin writes that this officer had a " psycho ##pathic hatred of the apache ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] carleton led his forces deep into the me ##sca ##ler ##o apache territory . [SEP]
[CLS] the me ##sca ##ler ##os were tired of fighting and put themselves under carson ' s protection . [SEP]
[CLS] carleton put these apache ##s on a remote and lonely reservation on the pe ##cos river . [SEP]
[CLS] carson disliked the apache ##s as well . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote in a report that the ji ##car ##illa apache ##s " were truly the most degraded and troubles ##ome indians we have in our department . . . we daily witness them in a state of into ##xi ##cation in our plaza . " [SEP]
[CLS] carson half - hearted ##ly supported carleton ' s plans . [SEP]
[CLS] he was tired and had suffered an injury two years before that gave him great trouble . [SEP]
[CLS] he resigned from the army in february 1863 . [SEP]
[CLS] carleton refused to accept the resignation because he wanted carson to lead a campaign against the navajo . [SEP]
[CLS] carleton had chosen a bleak site on the pe ##cos river for his reservation , which was called bo ##sque red ##ond ##o ( round grove ) . [SEP]
[CLS] he chose this site for the apache ##s and navajo ##s because it was far from white settlements . [SEP]
[CLS] he also wanted these apache ##s and navajo to act as a buffer for any aggressive acts committed upon the white settlements from ki ##owa ##s and coma ##nche ##s to the east of bo ##sque red ##ond ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] he thought as well that the remote ##ness and des ##ola ##tion of the reservation would discourage white settlement . [SEP]
[CLS] the me ##sca ##ler ##o apache ##s walked 130 mi to the reservation . [SEP]
[CLS] by march 1863 , four hundred apache ##s had settled around nearby fort sumner . [SEP]
[CLS] others had fled west to join fugitive bands of apache ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] by middle summer , many of these people were planting crops and doing other farm work . [SEP]
[CLS] on july 7 , carson , with little heart for the navajo round ##up , started the campaign against the tribe . [SEP]
[CLS] his orders were almost the same as those for the apache round ##up : he was to shoot all males on sight and take the women and children captives . [SEP]
[CLS] no peace treaties were to be made until all the navajo were on the reservation . [SEP]
[CLS] carson searched far and wide for the navajo . [SEP]
[CLS] he found their homes , fields , animals , and orchards , but the navajo were experts at disappearing quickly and hiding in their vast lands . [SEP]
[CLS] the round ##up proved frustrating for carson . [SEP]
[CLS] he was in his 50 ##s , tired , and ill . [SEP]
[CLS] by autumn 1863 , carson started to burn the navajo homes and fields and remove their animals from the area . [SEP]
[CLS] the navajo would star ##ve if this destruction continued . [SEP]
[CLS] one hundred eighty - eight navajo surrendered and were sent to bo ##sque red ##ond ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] life at the bo ##sque had turned grim ; murders took place . [SEP]
[CLS] the apache ##s and navajo ##s fought . [SEP]
[CLS] the water in the pe ##cos contained minerals that gave people cr ##amps and stomach ache ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] residents had to walk 12 mi to find fire ##wood . [SEP]
[CLS] carson wanted to take a winter break from the campaign . [SEP]
[CLS] major general carleton refused , ordering him to invade the canyon de che ##lly , where many navajo ##s had taken refuge . [SEP]
[CLS] historian david roberts writes , " carson ' s sweep through the canyon de che ##lly in the winter of 1863 – 1864 would prove to be the decisive action in the campaign . " [SEP]
[CLS] the canyon de che ##lly was a sacred place for the navajo . [SEP]
[CLS] they believed that it would now be their strongest sanctuary . [SEP]
[CLS] three hundred navajo took refuge on the canyon rim at a place called fortress rock . [SEP]
[CLS] they resisted carson ' s invasion by building rope ladder ##s and bridges , lowering water pots into a stream , and keeping quiet and out of sight . [SEP]
[CLS] these three hundred navajo survived the invasion . [SEP]
[CLS] in january 1864 , carson swept through the 35 mi canyon with his forces . [SEP]
[CLS] the thousands of peach trees in the canyon were cut down . [SEP]
[CLS] few navajo were killed or captured . [SEP]
[CLS] carson ' s invasion , however , proved to the navajo that the united states could invade their territory at any time . [SEP]
[CLS] many navajo surrendered at fort defiance , arizona . [SEP]
[CLS] by march 1864 , there were 3 , 000 refugees at fort can ##by . [SEP]
[CLS] an additional 5 , 000 arrived in the camp . [SEP]
[CLS] they were suffering from the intense cold and hunger . [SEP]
[CLS] carson asked for supplies to feed and cloth ##e them . [SEP]
[CLS] the thousands of navajo were forced to walk to bo ##sque red ##ond ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] many died along the way . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##rag ##glers in the rear were shot and killed . [SEP]
[CLS] in navajo history , this horrific trek is known as long walk of the navajo . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1866 , reports indicated that bo ##sque red ##ond ##o was a complete failure , and major general carleton was fired . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1868 , a treaty was signed , and the navajo were allowed to return to their homeland . [SEP]
[CLS] bo ##sque red ##ond ##o was closed . [SEP]
[CLS] on november 25 , 1864 , carson led his forces against the southwestern tribes at the first battle of adobe walls in the texas pan ##hand ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] adobe walls was an abandoned trading post blown up by its inhabitants to prevent a take - over by hostile indians . [SEP]
[CLS] combatants at the first battle were the united states army and indian scouts against ki ##owa ##s , coma ##nche ##s , and plains apache ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it was one of the largest engagements fought on the great plains . [SEP]
[CLS] the battle was the result of general carleton ' s belief that indians were responsible for the continuing attacks on settlers along the santa fe trail . [SEP]
[CLS] he wanted to punish them and brought in carson to do the job . [SEP]
[CLS] with most of the army engaged elsewhere during the american civil war , the protection the settlers sought was almost none ##xi ##sten ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] carson led 260 cavalry , 75 infantry , and 72 ut ##e and ji ##car ##illa apache army scouts . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , he had two mountain how ##itzer cannons . [SEP]
[CLS] on the morning of november 25 , carson discovered and attacked a ki ##owa village of 176 lodges . [SEP]
[CLS] after destroying this village , he moved forward to adobe walls . [SEP]
[CLS] carson found other coma ##nche villages in the area , and realized he would face a very large force of native americans . [SEP]
[CLS] a captain pet ##tis estimated that 1 , 200 to 1 , 400 coma ##nche and ki ##owa began to assemble . [SEP]
[CLS] that number would swell , according to some accounts , to an imp ##laus ##ible 3 , 000 . [SEP]
[CLS] four to five hours of battle ensued . [SEP]
[CLS] when carson ran low on ammunition and how ##itzer shells , he ordered his men to retreat to a nearby ki ##owa village . [SEP]
[CLS] there they burned the village and many fine buffalo robes . [SEP]
[CLS] his indian scouts killed and mu ##tila ##ted four elderly and weak ki ##owa ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] first adobe walls , located northeast of st ##inn ##ett in hutchinson county , texas , was carson ’ s last military engagement . [SEP]
[CLS] it ended in victory for the coma ##nche - ki ##owa alliance that then dominated the ll ##ano est ##aca ##do for another eight years . [SEP]
[CLS] the encounter could have resulted in a massacre worse than custer ' s last stand in montana territory twelve years thereafter . [SEP]
[CLS] three of carson ' s men died ; twenty - one were wounded . [SEP]
[CLS] more than one hundred warriors lost their lives , and two hundred were wounded . [SEP]
[CLS] the retreat to new mexico then began with few deaths among carson ' s men . [SEP]
[CLS] general carleton wrote to carson : " this brilliant affair adds another green leaf to the laurel wreath which you have so no ##bly won in the service of your country . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1847 , the future general william te ##cum ##se ##h sherman met kit carson in monterey , california . [SEP]
[CLS] sherman wrote : " his fame was then at its height , . . . and i was very anxious to see a man who had achieved such feat ##s of daring among the wild animals of the rocky mountains , and still wilder indians of the plains . . . i cannot express my surprise at behold ##ing such a small , st ##oop - shouldered man , with reddish hair , fr ##eck ##led face , soft blue eyes , and nothing to indicate extraordinary courage or daring . [SEP]
[CLS] he spoke but little and answered questions in mono ##sy ##lla ##bles . " [SEP]
[CLS] colonel edward w . w ##yn ##ko ##op wrote : " kit carson was five feet five and one half - inches tall , weighed about 140 pounds , of ne ##r ##vy , iron temperament , square ##ly built , slightly bow - legged , and those members apparently too short for his body . [SEP]
[CLS] but , his head and face made up for all the imperfect ##ions of the rest of his person . [SEP]
[CLS] his head was large and well - shaped with yellow straight hair , worn long , falling on his shoulders . [SEP]
[CLS] his face was fair and smooth as a woman ' s with high cheekbones , straight nose , a mouth with a firm , but somewhat sad expression , a keen , deep - set but beautiful , mild blue eye , which could become terrible under some circumstances , and like the warning of the rattle ##s ##na ##ke , gave notice of attack . [SEP]
[CLS] though quick - sighted , he was slow and soft of speech , and posed great natural modest ##y . " [SEP]
[CLS] lieutenant george douglas brewer ##ton made one coast - to - coast dispatch - carrying trip to washington , d . c . with carson . [SEP]
[CLS] brewer ##ton wrote : " the kit carson of my " imagination " was over six feet high — a sort of modern hercules in his build — with an enormous beard , and a voice like a rouse ##d lion . . . the real kit carson i found to be a plain , simple . . . man ; rather below the medium height , with brown , curling hair , little or no beard , and a voice as soft and gentle as a woman ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , the hero of a hundred desperate encounters , whose life had been mostly spent amid wilderness , where the white man is almost unknown , was one of dame nature ' s gentleman . . . " [SEP]
[CLS] carson joined free ##mas ##on ##ry in the santa fe territory of new mexico , petition ##ing in monte ##zu ##ma lodge no . 101 . [SEP]
[CLS] he was initiated an entered apprentice on april 22 , 1854 , passed to the degree of fellow ##craft june 17 , 1854 , and raised to the sublime degree of master mason december 26 , 1854 , just two days after his forty - fifth birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] kit , together with several other free ##mas ##ons in tao ##s , petitioned to charter bent lodge no . 204 ( now bent lodge # 42 ) from the grand lodge of missouri af & am , a request which was granted on june 1 , 1860 , with kit elected junior warden of the lodge . [SEP]
[CLS] the masonic fraternity continued to serve him and his family , well after his death . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1908 , the grand lodge of new mexico erected a wrought iron fence around his family burial plot . [SEP]
[CLS] the following year , the grand lodge challenged bent lodge to purchase and preserve kit ' s home . [SEP]
[CLS] more than a century later , the kit carson home & museum is still managed by the lodge today . [SEP]
[CLS] carson was married three times . [SEP]
[CLS] his first two wives were native american . [SEP]
[CLS] his third wife was mexican . [SEP]
[CLS] carson was the father of ten children . [SEP]
[CLS] he never wrote about his first two marriages in his " memoirs " . [SEP]
[CLS] he may have thought he would be known as a " sq ##ua ##w man " . [SEP]
[CLS] such men were not welcomed by polite society . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1836 , carson met an ara ##pa ##ho woman named wa ##ani ##be ( singing grass , or grass singing ) at a mountain man rendezvous held along the green river in wyoming . [SEP]
[CLS] singing grass was a lovely young woman , and many mountain men were in love with her . [SEP]
[CLS] carson was forced to fight a duel with a french trap ##per named cho ##uin ##ard for wa ##ani ##be ' s hand in marriage . [SEP]
[CLS] carson won , but he had a very narrow escape . [SEP]
[CLS] the french trap ##per ' s bullet sing ##ed his hair . [SEP]
[CLS] the duel was one of the best known stories about carson in the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] carson married singing grass . [SEP]
[CLS] she tended to his needs , and went with him on his trapping trips . [SEP]
[CLS] they had a daughter named ada ##line ( or ad ##elin ##e ) . [SEP]
[CLS] singing grass died after giving birth to carson ' s second daughter , in about 1841 . [SEP]
[CLS] this second child did not live long : in 1843 , she fell into a kettle of boiling soap in tao ##s , new mexico . [SEP]
[CLS] carson ' s life as a mountain man was too hard for a little girl so he took ada ##line to live with his sister mary ann carson rub ##ey in st . louis , missouri . [SEP]
[CLS] ada ##line was taught in a school for girls called a seminary . [SEP]
[CLS] carson brought her west when she was a teenager . [SEP]

[CLS] i jumped to my rifle and threw down my spelling book , and tha ##r it lies . " [SEP]
[CLS] carson enjoyed having other people read to him , and preferred the poetry of george gordon , lord byron . [SEP]
[CLS] carson thought sir walter scott ' s long poem , " the lady of the lake " was " the finest expression of outdoor life . " [SEP]
[CLS] carson eventually learned to write " c . carson " , but it was very difficult for him . [SEP]
[CLS] he made his mark on official papers , and this mark was then witnessed by a clerk or other official . [SEP]
[CLS] when the civil war ended , and the indian wars campaigns were in a lu ##ll , carson was appointed br ##eve ##t brigadier general ( dated march 13 , 1865 ) and appointed commandant of ft . garland , colorado , in the heart of ut ##e country . [SEP]

[CLS] soon after his return , his wife josef ##a died from complications after giving birth to their eighth child . [SEP]

[CLS] in the story line , carson and god ##ey stop to help a settler in dire straits . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1960s and 1970s , carson came under the scrutiny of contemporary historians , and ideas regarding his historical legacy began to change . [SEP]
[CLS] earlier accounts portrayed carson as an american hero , but in scholarship of this period he became an arch - villain in the military campaigns against the indians . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1992 , for example , a young professor at colorado college was successful in demanding that a period photograph of carson be removed from the rot ##c office . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1992 , a tourist told a journalist at the carson home in tao ##s , " i will not go into the home of that racist , gen ##oc ##idal killer . " [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1970s , a navajo at a trading post said , " no one here will talk about kit carson . [SEP]
[CLS] he was a butcher . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1993 , a symposium was organized to air various views on carson , but the navajo spoke ##sp ##eo ##ple refused to attend . [SEP]
[CLS] over time , historical analysis of carson shifted again . [SEP]
[CLS] david roberts writes , " carson ' s trajectory , over three and a half decades , from thought ##less killer of apache ##s and black ##fe ##et to defender and champion of the ut ##es , marks him out as one of the few frontiers ##men whose change of heart toward the indians , born not of missionary theory but of first hand experience , can serve as an ex ##em ##pl ##ar for the more en ##light ##ened policies that sporadic ##ally gained the day in the twentieth century . " [SEP]

[CLS] historian hampton sides said that carson believed the native americans needed reservations as a way of physically separating and shielding them from white hostility and white culture . [SEP]
[CLS] he is said to have viewed the raids on white settlements as driven by desperation , " committed from absolute necessity when in a starving condition . " [SEP]
[CLS] indian hunting grounds were disappearing as waves of white settlers filled the region . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2014 there was a petition to ren ##ame kit carson park in tao ##s , nm red willow park . [SEP]
