[CLS] historian david roberts writes : " if anything like pity filled carson ' s breast as , in his twenty - ninth year , he be ##held the ravaged camp of the black ##fe ##et , he did not bother to remember it . " [SEP]
[CLS] he found himself more and more in their company as he grew older and his attitude towards them became more respectful and humane . [SEP]

[CLS] he was a man of medium height , broad - shouldered , and deep - chest ##ed , with a clear steady blue eye and frank speech and address ; quiet and una ##ss ##uming . " [SEP]
[CLS] the purpose of this expedition was to map and describe the oregon trail as far as south pass . [SEP]

[CLS] he guided fremont across part of the oregon trail to the columbia river in oregon . [SEP]
[CLS] the purpose of the expedition was to map and describe the oregon trail from south pass , wyoming to the columbia river . [SEP]

[CLS] the party moved up along the sacramento river , continuing to kill indians as they went , then camped near k ##lam ##ath lake . [SEP]
[CLS] messages from washington , dc made it clear that president polk wanted california . [SEP]
[CLS] at k ##lam ##ath lake in southern oregon , fremont ' s party was hit in a revenge attack by 15 – 20 indians on the night of may 9 , 1846 . [SEP]
[CLS] two or three men in camp were killed . [SEP]
[CLS] carson was angry that his friends had been killed . [SEP]
[CLS] in retaliation for the attack , a few days later fremont ' s party massacre ##d a village of k ##lam ##ath people along the williamson river in the k ##lam ##ath lake massacre . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no evidence that the village in question had anything to do with the previous attack . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 1846 , fremont and carson both participated in a california uprising against mexico called the bear flag revolt . [SEP]
[CLS] the american rebels found courage to oppose mexico because they had fremont — who had written an oath of allegiance — and his troops behind them . [SEP]
[CLS] fremont and his men were able to give some protection to the americans . [SEP]
[CLS] he ordered carson to execute an old mexican man named jose de los reyes be ##rre ##yes ##a and his two adult nephew ##s , who had been captured when they stepped ashore at san francisco bay , to prevent them from not ##ifying mexico about the uprising . [SEP]
[CLS] fremont worked hard to win california for the united states , for a time fashion ##ing himself as its military governor , until being replaced by general ke ##arney , who out - ranked him . [SEP]

[CLS] he was taking them to settlers in northern california , and southern oregon . [SEP]
[CLS] carson ' s fame spread throughout the united states with government reports , dime novels , newspaper accounts , and word of mouth . [SEP]
[CLS] a factual biography was attempted by dew ##itt c . peters in 1859 , but has been criticized for ina ##cc ##ura ##cies and ex ##agger ##ations . [SEP]
[CLS] carson became the hero of juvenile fiction not just in the united states , but also published in french , german , portuguese , gujarati , hindi , singh ##ales ##e , arabic and japanese . [SEP]
[CLS] it was called " an adventure of kit carson : a tale of the sacramento " . [SEP]
[CLS] other stories were also printed , such as " kit carson : the prince of the gold ##hunter ##s " and " the prairie flower " . [SEP]
[CLS] his exciting adventures were printed in the story " ki ##owa charley , the white mustang ##er ; or , rocky mountain kit ' s last scalp hunt " . [SEP]
[CLS] in this story , an older kit is said to have " ridden into sioux camps una ##tten ##ded and alone , had ridden out again , but with the scalp ##s of their greatest warriors at his belt . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1849 , carson guided soldiers on the trail of mrs . ann white , her baby daughter and " negro servant , " who had been captured by ji ##car ##illa apache ##s and ut ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] the commanding officer , captain william gr ##ier of the 1st cavalry regiment , ignored carson ' s advice about an immediate rescue attempt after catching the ji ##car ##illa ##s unaware , but after a shot was fired , the order was given to attack , by which time the ji ##car ##illa ##s had started to flee . [SEP]
[CLS] as carson describes it in his autobiography : " in about 200 yards , pursuing the indians , the body of mrs . white was found , perfectly warm , had not been killed more than five minutes - shot through the heart by an arrow . . . [SEP]
[CLS] i am certain that if the indians had been charged immediately on our arrival she would have been saved . " [SEP]
[CLS] her child and servant were taken away by the fleeing ji ##car ##illa ##s and killed shortly after the attack , according to a 1850 report by james s . calhoun , the superintendent of indian affairs in new mexico . [SEP]
[CLS] a soldier in the rescue party wrote : " mrs . white was a frail , delicate , and very beautiful woman , but having undergone such usage as she suffered nothing but a wreck remained ; it was literally covered with blows and scratches . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote in his " memoirs " : " in camp was found a book , the first of the kind i had ever seen , in which i was made a great hero , sl ##ay ##ing indians by the hundreds . . . [SEP]
[CLS] the book was called " kit carson , the nestor of the mountains , from facts narrated by himself " . [SEP]
[CLS] when the book was read to carson he said , " peters laid it on a lee ##tle too thick . " [SEP]
[CLS] lasting from 1846 to 1848 , the mexican – american war was an armed conflict between the united states and mexico . [SEP]
[CLS] at war ' s end , mexico was forced to sell the territories of alta california and new mexico to the united states under the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo . [SEP]
[CLS] one of carson ' s best known adventures took place during this war . [SEP]
[CLS] in december 1846 , carson was ordered by general stephen w . ke ##ar ##ny to guide him and his troops from soc ##orro , new mexico to san diego , california . [SEP]
[CLS] mexican soldiers attacked ke ##ar ##ny and his men near the village of san pas ##qual , california . [SEP]
[CLS] he knew he could not win ; he ordered his men to take cover on a small hill . [SEP]
[CLS] on the night of december 8 , carson , a naval lieutenant named beale , and an indian scout left ke ##ar ##ny to bring reinforcements from san diego , 25 mi away . [SEP]
[CLS] carson and the lieutenant removed their shoes because they made too much noise , and walked barefoot through the desert . [SEP]
[CLS] he planned to break through the mexican lines the next morning , but 200 mounted american soldiers arrived in san pas ##qual late that night . [SEP]
[CLS] he led the 1st new mexico volunteer infantry and trained the new men . [SEP]
[CLS] the volunteers fought the confederate forces in the battle of valve ##rde in new mexico , in february 1862 . [SEP]
[CLS] the me ##sca ##ler ##os were tired of fighting and put themselves under carson ' s protection . [SEP]
[CLS] carleton put these apache ##s on a remote and lonely reservation on the pe ##cos river . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote in a report that the ji ##car ##illa apache ##s " were truly the most degraded and troubles ##ome indians we have in our department . . . we daily witness them in a state of into ##xi ##cation in our plaza . " [SEP]
[CLS] he was tired and had suffered an injury two years before that gave him great trouble . [SEP]
[CLS] carleton refused to accept the resignation because he wanted carson to lead a campaign against the navajo . [SEP]
[CLS] carleton had chosen a bleak site on the pe ##cos river for his reservation , which was called bo ##sque red ##ond ##o ( round grove ) . [SEP]
[CLS] he chose this site for the apache ##s and navajo ##s because it was far from white settlements . [SEP]
[CLS] he also wanted these apache ##s and navajo to act as a buffer for any aggressive acts committed upon the white settlements from ki ##owa ##s and coma ##nche ##s to the east of bo ##sque red ##ond ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] by middle summer , many of these people were planting crops and doing other farm work . [SEP]
[CLS] on july 7 , carson , with little heart for the navajo round ##up , started the campaign against the tribe . [SEP]
[CLS] his orders were almost the same as those for the apache round ##up : he was to shoot all males on sight and take the women and children captives . [SEP]
[CLS] no peace treaties were to be made until all the navajo were on the reservation . [SEP]
[CLS] carson searched far and wide for the navajo . [SEP]
[CLS] he found their homes , fields , animals , and orchards , but the navajo were experts at disappearing quickly and hiding in their vast lands . [SEP]
[CLS] he was in his 50 ##s , tired , and ill . [SEP]
[CLS] by autumn 1863 , carson started to burn the navajo homes and fields and remove their animals from the area . [SEP]
[CLS] carson wanted to take a winter break from the campaign . [SEP]
[CLS] major general carleton refused , ordering him to invade the canyon de che ##lly , where many navajo ##s had taken refuge . [SEP]
[CLS] historian david roberts writes , " carson ' s sweep through the canyon de che ##lly in the winter of 1863 – 1864 would prove to be the decisive action in the campaign . " [SEP]
[CLS] the canyon de che ##lly was a sacred place for the navajo . [SEP]
[CLS] they believed that it would now be their strongest sanctuary . [SEP]
[CLS] three hundred navajo took refuge on the canyon rim at a place called fortress rock . [SEP]
[CLS] they resisted carson ' s invasion by building rope ladder ##s and bridges , lowering water pots into a stream , and keeping quiet and out of sight . [SEP]
[CLS] the thousands of peach trees in the canyon were cut down . [SEP]
[CLS] carson ' s invasion , however , proved to the navajo that the united states could invade their territory at any time . [SEP]
[CLS] carson asked for supplies to feed and cloth ##e them . [SEP]
[CLS] the thousands of navajo were forced to walk to bo ##sque red ##ond ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1866 , reports indicated that bo ##sque red ##ond ##o was a complete failure , and major general carleton was fired . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1868 , a treaty was signed , and the navajo were allowed to return to their homeland . [SEP]
[CLS] on november 25 , 1864 , carson led his forces against the southwestern tribes at the first battle of adobe walls in the texas pan ##hand ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] combatants at the first battle were the united states army and indian scouts against ki ##owa ##s , coma ##nche ##s , and plains apache ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the battle was the result of general carleton ' s belief that indians were responsible for the continuing attacks on settlers along the santa fe trail . [SEP]
[CLS] with most of the army engaged elsewhere during the american civil war , the protection the settlers sought was almost none ##xi ##sten ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] on the morning of november 25 , carson discovered and attacked a ki ##owa village of 176 lodges . [SEP]
[CLS] carson found other coma ##nche villages in the area , and realized he would face a very large force of native americans . [SEP]
[CLS] when carson ran low on ammunition and how ##itzer shells , he ordered his men to retreat to a nearby ki ##owa village . [SEP]
[CLS] first adobe walls , located northeast of st ##inn ##ett in hutchinson county , texas , was carson ’ s last military engagement . [SEP]
[CLS] it ended in victory for the coma ##nche - ki ##owa alliance that then dominated the ll ##ano est ##aca ##do for another eight years . [SEP]
[CLS] the encounter could have resulted in a massacre worse than custer ' s last stand in montana territory twelve years thereafter . [SEP]
[CLS] the retreat to new mexico then began with few deaths among carson ' s men . [SEP]
[CLS] general carleton wrote to carson : " this brilliant affair adds another green leaf to the laurel wreath which you have so no ##bly won in the service of your country . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1847 , the future general william te ##cum ##se ##h sherman met kit carson in monterey , california . [SEP]
[CLS] sherman wrote : " his fame was then at its height , . . . and i was very anxious to see a man who had achieved such feat ##s of daring among the wild animals of the rocky mountains , and still wilder indians of the plains . . . [SEP]
[CLS] i cannot express my surprise at behold ##ing such a small , st ##oop - shouldered man , with reddish hair , fr ##eck ##led face , soft blue eyes , and nothing to indicate extraordinary courage or daring . [SEP]
[CLS] colonel edward w . w ##yn ##ko ##op wrote : " kit carson was five feet five and one half - inches tall , weighed about 140 pounds , of ne ##r ##vy , iron temperament , square ##ly built , slightly bow - legged , and those members apparently too short for his body . [SEP]
[CLS] but , his head and face made up for all the imperfect ##ions of the rest of his person . [SEP]
[CLS] his face was fair and smooth as a woman ' s with high cheekbones , straight nose , a mouth with a firm , but somewhat sad expression , a keen , deep - set but beautiful , mild blue eye , which could become terrible under some circumstances , and like the warning of the rattle ##s ##na ##ke , gave notice of attack . [SEP]
[CLS] brewer ##ton wrote : " the kit carson of my " imagination " was over six feet high — a sort of modern hercules in his build — with an enormous beard , and a voice like a rouse ##d lion . . . [SEP]
[CLS] the real kit carson i found to be a plain , simple . . . man ; rather below the medium height , with brown , curling hair , little or no beard , and a voice as soft and gentle as a woman ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , the hero of a hundred desperate encounters , whose life had been mostly spent amid wilderness , where the white man is almost unknown , was one of dame nature ' s gentleman . . . " [SEP]
[CLS] carson joined free ##mas ##on ##ry in the santa fe territory of new mexico , petition ##ing in monte ##zu ##ma lodge no . [SEP]
[CLS] he was initiated an entered apprentice on april 22 , 1854 , passed to the degree of fellow ##craft june 17 , 1854 , and raised to the sublime degree of master mason december 26 , 1854 , just two days after his forty - fifth birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] kit , together with several other free ##mas ##ons in tao ##s , petitioned to charter bent lodge no . [SEP]
[CLS] 204 ( now bent lodge # 42 ) from the grand lodge of missouri af & am , a request which was granted on june 1 , 1860 , with kit elected junior warden of the lodge . [SEP]
[CLS] the masonic fraternity continued to serve him and his family , well after his death . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1908 , the grand lodge of new mexico erected a wrought iron fence around his family burial plot . [SEP]
[CLS] more than a century later , the kit carson home & museum is still managed by the lodge today . [SEP]
[CLS] carson was the father of ten children . [SEP]
[CLS] carson was forced to fight a duel with a french trap ##per named cho ##uin ##ard for wa ##ani ##be ' s hand in marriage . [SEP]
[CLS] carson won , but he had a very narrow escape . [SEP]
[CLS] the duel was one of the best known stories about carson in the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] making - out - road divorced him in the way of her people by putting ada ##line and all of carson ' s property outside their tent . [SEP]
[CLS] she was the daughter of a wealthy and prominent mexican couple living in tao ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] i jumped to my rifle and threw down my spelling book , and tha ##r it lies . " [SEP]
[CLS] carson thought sir walter scott ' s long poem , " the lady of the lake " was " the finest expression of outdoor life . " [SEP]
[CLS] he made his mark on official papers , and this mark was then witnessed by a clerk or other official . [SEP]
[CLS] when the civil war ended , and the indian wars campaigns were in a lu ##ll , carson was appointed br ##eve ##t brigadier general ( dated march 13 , 1865 ) and appointed commandant of ft . garland , colorado , in the heart of ut ##e country . [SEP]
[CLS] carson had many ut ##e friends in the area and assisted in government relations . [SEP]
[CLS] after being mustered out of the army , carson took up ranch ##ing , settling at bog ##gs ##ville in bent county . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1868 , at the urging of washington and the commissioner of indian affairs , carson journey ##ed to washington d . c . , where he escorted several ut ##e chiefs to meet with the president of the united states to plead for assistance to their tribe . [SEP]
[CLS] soon after his return , his wife josef ##a died from complications after giving birth to their eighth child . [SEP]
[CLS] he died a month later at age 58 on may 23 , 1868 , in the presence of dr . tilt ##on and his friend thomas bog ##gs in the surgeon ' s quarters at fort lyon , colorado . [SEP]

[CLS] in the story line , carson and god ##ey stop to help a settler in dire straits . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1960s and 1970s , carson came under the scrutiny of contemporary historians , and ideas regarding his historical legacy began to change . [SEP]
[CLS] earlier accounts portrayed carson as an american hero , but in scholarship of this period he became an arch - villain in the military campaigns against the indians . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1992 , for example , a young professor at colorado college was successful in demanding that a period photograph of carson be removed from the rot ##c office . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1993 , a symposium was organized to air various views on carson , but the navajo spoke ##sp ##eo ##ple refused to attend . [SEP]
[CLS] over time , historical analysis of carson shifted again . [SEP]
[CLS] david roberts writes , " carson ' s trajectory , over three and a half decades , from thought ##less killer of apache ##s and black ##fe ##et to defender and champion of the ut ##es , marks him out as one of the few frontiers ##men whose change of heart toward the indians , born not of missionary theory but of first hand experience , can serve as an ex ##em ##pl ##ar for the more en ##light ##ened policies that sporadic ##ally gained the day in the twentieth century .
