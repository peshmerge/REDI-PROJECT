Carson became a frontier legend in his own lifetime via biographies and news articles.
His understated nature belied confirmed reports of his fearlessness, combat skills, tenacity, and profound effect on the westward expansion of the United States.
Carson left home in rural present-day Missouri at age 16 to become a mountain man and trapper in the West.
He lived among and married into the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes.
Frémont's expeditions covered much of California, Oregon, and the Great Basin area.
Later in the war, Carson was a scout and courier, celebrated for his rescue mission after the Battle of San Pasqual and for his coast-to-coast journey from California to Washington, D.C. to deliver news of the conflict in California to the U.S. government.
During the American Civil War, Carson led a regiment of mostly Hispanic volunteers from New Mexico on the side of the Union at the Battle of Valverde in 1862.
When the Confederate threat to New Mexico was eliminated, Carson led forces to suppress the Navajo, Mescalero Apache, and the Kiowa and Comanche peoples by destroying their food sources.
Carson was married three times and had ten children.
Christopher Houston Carson was born on Christmas Eve, 1809 at the Home of Thomas Young in Houstonville, Iredell County, North Carolina.
His parents were Lindsay Carson and his second wife, Rebecca Robinson.
Lindsay had had five children by his first wife Lucy Bradley, and ten more children by Rebecca.
In addition to their own family, the Carsons would always invite friends and close neighbors.
Lindsay's wife, Rebecca was expecting the imminent birth of their 6th child.
Early in the evening, the hostess, Mrs. Young noticed that Rebecca Carson seemed to be in some distress and knowing of her expectant child, Mrs. Young took Rebecca to a room in another building where she could be in a more comforting environment and attended by a helpful attendant, a woman who was an African-American slave.
It was not long until the sound of a new pair of strong lungs sounded out the alarm, a new child had been born to Lindsay and Rebecca Carson.
The new mother and father decided quickly their son should be named Christopher Houston Carson, and because of his small size, to give him the nick-name, "Kit."
He was a farmer, a cabin builder, and a veteran of the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.
The Carson family moved to Boone's Lick, Howard County, Missouri, when Kit was about one year old.
The family settled on a tract of land owned by the sons of Daniel Boone, who had purchased the land from the Spanish.
Missouri was then the frontier of American expansionism west; cabins were "forted" with tall stockade fences to defend against Indian attacks.
These men were ready to kill any Indian who attacked.
< Carson wrote in his "Memoirs": "For two or three years after our arrival, we had to remain forted and it was necessary to have men stationed at the extremities of the fields for the protection of those that were laboring.
Despite being penniless, his mother took care of her children alone for four years.
Kit was a young teenager at the time and did not get along with his stepfather.
The decision was made to apprentice him to David Workman, a saddler in Franklin, Missouri.
Kit wrote in his "Memoirs" that Workman was "a good man, and I often recall the kind treatment I received."
Franklin was situated at the eastern end of the Santa Fe Trail, which had opened two years earlier.
Many of the customers at the saddle shop were trappers and traders, from whom Carson heard stirring tales of the West.
Carson found work in the saddlery not to his taste: he once stated "the business did not suit me, and I concluded to leave".
He went west with a caravan of fur trappers, tending their livestock.
They made their trek over the Santa Fe Trail to Santa Fe, the capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, reaching their destination in November 1826.
Carson lived with Mathew Kinkead, a trapper and explorer who had served with Carson's older brothers during the War of 1812.
Carson was mentored by Kinkead in learning the skills of a trapper, while learning the necessary languages for trade.
He wrote that he would give a one cent reward to anyone who brought the boy back to Franklin.
No one claimed the reward.
The advertisement featured the first printed description of Carson: "Christopher Carson, a boy about 16 years old, small of his age, but thick set; light hair, ran away from the subscriber, living in Franklin, Howard county, Missouri, to whom he had been bound to learn the saddler's trade."
He also worked at a copper mine near the Gila River in southwestern New Mexico.
In later life, Carson never mentioned any women from his youth.
There are only three specific women mentioned in his writing: Josefa Jaramillo, his third and last wife; a comrade's mother in Washington, DC; and Mrs. Ann White, a victim of Indian atrocities.
At the age of nineteen, Carson began his career as a mountain man.
He traveled through many parts of the American West with famous mountain men like Jim Bridger and Old Bill Williams.
The leadership of Young and the experience of the venture are credited with shaping Carson's early life in the mountains.
Carson joined a wagon train rescue party after entering Taos, and although the perpetrators had fled the scene of atrocities Young had the opportunity to witness Carson's horsemanship and courage.
Carson joined another expedition led by Thomas Fitzpatrick and William Levin in 1831.
Carson would hunt and trap in the West for about ten years.
He was known as a reliable man and a good fighter.
After collecting beavers from traps, he had to hold onto them for months at a time until the annual Rocky Mountain Rendezvous, held in remote areas of the West like the banks of the Green River in Wyoming.
With the money received for the pelts, necessities of an independent life including fish hooks, flour and tobacco were procured.
As there was little to no medical access in the varied regions he worked in, Carson had to dress his wounds and nurse himself.
Carson's primary clothing at the time was in deer skins that had stiffened after being left outdoors for a time.
This suit offered some protection against particular weapons employed by Indians.
One of the bears tried to make him fall by shaking the tree, but was not successful and eventually went away.
He wrote in his "Memoirs" that: "The bear finally concluded to leave, of which I was heartily pleased, never having been so scared in my life."
Fashionable men in London, Paris, and New York wanted silk hats instead of beaver hats.
He wrote in his "Memoirs" that "Beaver was getting scarce, it became necessary to try our hand at something else."
In 1841, he was hired at Bent's Fort in Colorado, at the largest building on the Santa Fe Trail.
He returned to Bent's Fort several times during his life to again provide meat for the fort's residents.
Carson probably killed and took the scalp of his first Indian when he was nineteen years old, during Ewing Young's expedition.
Carson's "Memoirs" are replete with stories about hostile Indian encounters with the memoirist.
Carson and two other men sprayed the Crow camp with gunfire, killing almost every Crow.
Carson wrote in his "Memoirs": "During our pursuit for the lost animals, we suffered considerably but, the success of having recovered our horses and sending many a redskin to his long home, our sufferings were soon forgotten."
Carson viewed the Blackfoot nation as a hostile tribe, believing they posed the greatest threat to his livelihood, safety, and life.
Historian David Roberts has written: "It was taken for granted that the Blackfeet were bad Indians; to shoot them whenever he could was a mountain man's instinct and duty."
He was traveling with about one hundred mountain men led by Jim Bridger.
In Montana territory, the group found a teepee with three Indian corpses inside.
Bridger wanted to move on, but Carson and the other young men wanted to kill the Blackfeet.
The Blackfeet found some safety in a pile of rocks but were driven away.
Historian David Roberts writes: "If anything like pity filled Carson's breast as, in his twenty-ninth year, he beheld the ravaged camp of the Blackfeet, he did not bother to remember it."
He found himself more and more in their company as he grew older and his attitude towards them became more respectful and humane.
He urged the government to set aside lands called reservations for their use.
As an Indian agent, he saw to it that those under his watch were treated with honesty, fairness, and clothed and fed properly.
Historian David Roberts believes his first marriage to an Arapaho woman named Singing Grass "softened the stern and pragmatic mountaineer's opportunism."
In April 1842, Carson went back to his childhood home in Missouri to put his daughter Adaline in the care of relatives.
On the return trip, Carson met John C. Frémont aboard a steamboat on the Missouri River.
Frémont was a United States Army officer in the Corps of Topographical Engineers.
After a brief conversation, Frémont hired Carson as a guide at $100 a month.
Frémont wrote, "I was pleased with him and his manner of address at this first meeting.
He was a man of medium height, broad-shouldered, and deep-chested, with a clear steady blue eye and frank speech and address; quiet and unassuming."
The purpose of this expedition was to map and describe the Oregon Trail as far as South Pass.
These reports made Carson's name known across the United States, and spurred a migration of settlers westward to Oregon via the Oregon Trail.
He guided Frémont across part of the Oregon Trail to the Columbia River in Oregon.
The purpose of the expedition was to map and describe the Oregon Trail from South Pass, Wyoming to the Columbia River.
They also side-tripped to Great Salt Lake in Utah, using a rubber raft to navigate the waters.
On the way to California, the party suffered from bad weather in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, but were saved by Carson's good judgement and his skills as a guide.
The government liked his reports, but ignored his illegal trip into Mexico.
The two told Carson that Native Americans had ambushed their party of travelers.
Carson and a mountain man friend named Alexis Godey went after the murderers.
They rushed into their camp, killing and scalping two of the murderers.
The stolen horses were recovered and returned to the Mexican man and boy.
It confirmed his status as a western hero in the eyes of the American people.
In 1845, Carson guided Frémont on their third and last expedition.
President Polk wanted the province of Alta California for the United States.
Frémont went north to Oregon, though not before instigating the Sacramento River massacre, in which at least 150 Indians were killed in an unprovoked attack.
The party moved up along the Sacramento River, continuing to kill Indians as they went, then camped near Klamath Lake.
Messages from Washington, DC made it clear that President Polk wanted California.
At Klamath Lake in southern Oregon, Frémont's party was hit in a revenge attack by 15–20 Indians on the night of May 9, 1846.
Two or three men in camp were killed.
Carson was angry that his friends had been killed.
In retaliation for the attack, a few days later Frémont's party massacred a village of Klamath people along the Williamson River in the Klamath Lake massacre.
There was no evidence that the village in question had anything to do with the previous attack.
In June 1846, Frémont and Carson both participated in a California uprising against Mexico called the Bear Flag Revolt.
The American rebels found courage to oppose Mexico because they had Frémont—who had written an oath of allegiance—and his troops behind them.
Frémont and his men were able to give some protection to the Americans.
He ordered Carson to execute an old Mexican man named José de los Reyes Berreyesa and his two adult nephews, who had been captured when they stepped ashore at San Francisco Bay, to prevent them from notifying Mexico about the uprising.
Frémont worked hard to win California for the United States, for a time fashioning himself as its military governor, until being replaced by General Kearney, who out-ranked him.
In 1848, he took news of the California Gold Strike to the nation's capitol.
He was taking them to settlers in northern California, and southern Oregon.
Carson's fame spread throughout the United States with government reports, dime novels, newspaper accounts, and word of mouth.
A factual biography was attempted by DeWitt C. Peters in 1859, but has been criticized for inaccuracies and exaggerations.
Carson became the hero of juvenile fiction not just in the United States, but also published in French, German, Portuguese, Gujarati, Hindi, Singhalese, Arabic and Japanese.
It was called "An Adventure of Kit Carson: A Tale of the Sacramento".
Other stories were also printed, such as "Kit Carson: The Prince of the Goldhunters" and "The Prairie Flower".
His exciting adventures were printed in the story "Kiowa Charley, The White Mustanger; or, Rocky Mountain Kit's Last Scalp Hunt".
In this story, an older Kit is said to have "ridden into Sioux camps unattended and alone, had ridden out again, but with the scalps of their greatest warriors at his belt."
In 1849, Carson guided soldiers on the trail of Mrs. Ann White, her baby daughter and "negro servant," who had been captured by Jicarilla Apaches and Utes.
The commanding officer, Captain William Grier of the 1st Cavalry Regiment, ignored Carson's advice about an immediate rescue attempt after catching the Jicarillas unaware, but after a shot was fired, the order was given to attack, by which time the Jicarillas had started to flee.
As Carson describes it in his autobiography: "In about 200 yards, pursuing the Indians, the body of Mrs. White was found, perfectly warm, had not been killed more than five minutes - shot through the heart by an arrow...
I am certain that if the Indians had been charged immediately on our arrival she would have been saved."
Her child and servant were taken away by the fleeing Jicarillas and killed shortly after the attack, according to a 1850 report by James S. Calhoun, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs in New Mexico.
A soldier in the rescue party wrote: "Mrs. White was a frail, delicate, and very beautiful woman, but having undergone such usage as she suffered nothing but a wreck remained; it was literally covered with blows and scratches.
He wrote in his "Memoirs": "In camp was found a book, the first of the kind I had ever seen, in which I was made a great hero, slaying Indians by the hundreds ...
The book was called "Kit Carson, the Nestor of the Mountains, from Facts Narrated by Himself".
When the book was read to Carson he said, "Peters laid it on a leetle too thick."
Lasting from 1846 to 1848, the Mexican–American War was an armed conflict between the United States and Mexico.
At war's end, Mexico was forced to sell the territories of Alta California and New Mexico to the United States under The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
One of Carson's best known adventures took place during this war.
In December 1846, Carson was ordered by General Stephen W. Kearny to guide him and his troops from Socorro, New Mexico to San Diego, California.
Mexican soldiers attacked Kearny and his men near the village of San Pasqual, California.
He knew he could not win; he ordered his men to take cover on a small hill.
On the night of December 8, Carson, a naval lieutenant named Beale, and an Indian scout left Kearny to bring reinforcements from San Diego, 25 mi away.
Carson and the lieutenant removed their shoes because they made too much noise, and walked barefoot through the desert.
He planned to break through the Mexican lines the next morning, but 200 mounted American soldiers arrived in San Pasqual late that night.
He led the 1st New Mexico Volunteer Infantry and trained the new men.
The Volunteers fought the Confederate forces in the Battle of Valverde in New Mexico, in February 1862.
The Mescaleros were tired of fighting and put themselves under Carson's protection.
Carleton put these Apaches on a remote and lonely reservation on the Pecos River.
He wrote in a report that the Jicarilla Apaches "were truly the most degraded and troublesome Indians we have in our department ... We daily witness them in a state of intoxication in our plaza."
He was tired and had suffered an injury two years before that gave him great trouble.
Carleton refused to accept the resignation because he wanted Carson to lead a campaign against the Navajo.
Carleton had chosen a bleak site on the Pecos River for his reservation, which was called Bosque Redondo (Round Grove).
He chose this site for the Apaches and Navajos because it was far from white settlements.
He also wanted these Apaches and Navajo to act as a buffer for any aggressive acts committed upon the white settlements from Kiowas and Comanches to the east of Bosque Redondo.
By middle summer, many of these people were planting crops and doing other farm work.
On July 7, Carson, with little heart for the Navajo roundup, started the campaign against the tribe.
His orders were almost the same as those for the Apache roundup: he was to shoot all males on sight and take the women and children captives.
No peace treaties were to be made until all the Navajo were on the reservation.
Carson searched far and wide for the Navajo.
He found their homes, fields, animals, and orchards, but the Navajo were experts at disappearing quickly and hiding in their vast lands.
He was in his 50s, tired, and ill.
By autumn 1863, Carson started to burn the Navajo homes and fields and remove their animals from the area.
Carson wanted to take a winter break from the campaign.
Major General Carleton refused, ordering him to invade the Canyon de Chelly, where many Navajos had taken refuge.
Historian David Roberts writes, "Carson's sweep through the Canyon de Chelly in the winter of 1863–1864 would prove to be the decisive action in the Campaign."
The Canyon de Chelly was a sacred place for the Navajo.
They believed that it would now be their strongest sanctuary.
Three hundred Navajo took refuge on the canyon rim at a place called Fortress Rock.
They resisted Carson's invasion by building rope ladders and bridges, lowering water pots into a stream, and keeping quiet and out of sight.
The thousands of peach trees in the canyon were cut down.
Carson's invasion, however, proved to the Navajo that the United States could invade their territory at any time.
Carson asked for supplies to feed and clothe them.
The thousands of Navajo were forced to walk to Bosque Redondo.
By 1866, reports indicated that Bosque Redondo was a complete failure, and Major General Carleton was fired.
In 1868, a treaty was signed, and the Navajo were allowed to return to their homeland.
On November 25, 1864, Carson led his forces against the southwestern tribes at the First Battle of Adobe Walls in the Texas panhandle.
Combatants at the First Battle were the United States Army and Indian scouts against Kiowas, Comanches, and Plains Apaches.
The battle was the result of General Carleton's belief that Indians were responsible for the continuing attacks on settlers along the Santa Fe Trail.
With most of the Army engaged elsewhere during the American Civil War, the protection the settlers sought was almost nonexistent.
On the morning of November 25, Carson discovered and attacked a Kiowa village of 176 lodges.
Carson found other Comanche villages in the area, and realized he would face a very large force of Native Americans.
When Carson ran low on ammunition and howitzer shells, he ordered his men to retreat to a nearby Kiowa village.
First Adobe Walls, located northeast of Stinnett in Hutchinson County, Texas, was Carson’s last military engagement.
It ended in victory for the Comanche-Kiowa alliance that then dominated the Llano Estacado for another eight years.
The encounter could have resulted in a massacre worse than Custer's Last Stand in Montana Territory twelve years thereafter.
The retreat to New Mexico then began with few deaths among Carson's men.
General Carleton wrote to Carson: "This brilliant affair adds another green leaf to the laurel wreath which you have so nobly won in the service of your country."
In 1847, the future General William Tecumseh Sherman met Kit Carson in Monterey, California.
Sherman wrote: "His fame was then at its height, ... and I was very anxious to see a man who had achieved such feats of daring among the wild animals of the Rocky Mountains, and still wilder Indians of the plains ...
I cannot express my surprise at beholding such a small, stoop-shouldered man, with reddish hair, freckled face, soft blue eyes, and nothing to indicate extraordinary courage or daring.
Colonel Edward W. Wynkoop wrote: "Kit Carson was five feet five and one half-inches tall, weighed about 140 pounds, of nervy, iron temperament, squarely built, slightly bow-legged, and those members apparently too short for his body.
But, his head and face made up for all the imperfections of the rest of his person.
His face was fair and smooth as a woman's with high cheekbones, straight nose, a mouth with a firm, but somewhat sad expression, a keen, deep-set but beautiful, mild blue eye, which could become terrible under some circumstances, and like the warning of the rattlesnake, gave notice of attack.
Brewerton wrote: "The Kit Carson of my "imagination" was over six feet high — a sort of modern Hercules in his build — with an enormous beard, and a voice like a roused lion ...
The real Kit Carson I found to be a plain, simple ... man; rather below the medium height, with brown, curling hair, little or no beard, and a voice as soft and gentle as a woman's.
In fact, the hero of a hundred desperate encounters, whose life had been mostly spent amid wilderness, where the white man is almost unknown, was one of Dame Nature's gentleman ..."
Carson joined Freemasonry in the Santa Fe Territory of New Mexico, petitioning in Montezuma Lodge No.
He was initiated an Entered Apprentice on April 22, 1854, passed to the degree of Fellowcraft June 17, 1854, and raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason December 26, 1854, just two days after his forty-fifth birthday.
Kit, together with several other Freemasons in Taos, petitioned to Charter Bent Lodge No.
204 (now Bent Lodge # 42) from the Grand Lodge of Missouri AF&AM, a request which was granted on June 1, 1860, with Kit elected Junior Warden of the lodge.
The Masonic fraternity continued to serve him and his family, well after his death.
In 1908, the Grand Lodge of New Mexico erected a wrought iron fence around his family burial plot.
More than a century later, the Kit Carson Home & Museum is still managed by the lodge today.
Carson was the father of ten children.
Carson was forced to fight a duel with a French trapper named Chouinard for Waanibe's hand in marriage.
Carson won, but he had a very narrow escape.
The duel was one of the best known stories about Carson in the 19th century.
Making-Out-Road divorced him in the way of her people by putting Adaline and all of Carson's property outside their tent.
She was the daughter of a wealthy and prominent Mexican couple living in Taos.
I jumped to my rifle and threw down my spelling book, and thar it lies."
Carson thought Sir Walter Scott's long poem, "The Lady of the Lake" was "the finest expression of outdoor life."
He made his mark on official papers, and this mark was then witnessed by a clerk or other official.
When the Civil War ended, and the Indian Wars campaigns were in a lull, Carson was appointed brevet brigadier general (dated March 13, 1865) and appointed commandant of Ft. Garland, Colorado, in the heart of Ute country.
Carson had many Ute friends in the area and assisted in government relations.
After being mustered out of the Army, Carson took up ranching, settling at Boggsville in Bent County.
In 1868, at the urging of Washington and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Carson journeyed to Washington D.C., where he escorted several Ute Chiefs to meet with the President of the United States to plead for assistance to their tribe.
Soon after his return, his wife Josefa died from complications after giving birth to their eighth child.
He died a month later at age 58 on May 23, 1868, in the presence of Dr. Tilton and his friend Thomas Boggs in the surgeon's quarters at Fort Lyon, Colorado.
The cause of his death was abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Carson's home in Taos, New Mexico is today a museum called the Kit Carson Home and Museum.
A monument was raised in the plaza at Santa Fe by the New Mexico Grand Army.
A river in Nevada is named for Carson as well as the state's capital, Carson City.
In 1966, the actor Phillip Pine played Carson with Michael Pate as fellow Fremont scout Frenchy Godey in the episode "Samaritans, Mountain Style" of the syndicated series, "Death Valley Days", hosted by Robert Taylor.
In the story line, Carson and Godey stop to help a settler in dire straits.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Carson came under the scrutiny of contemporary historians, and ideas regarding his historical legacy began to change.
Earlier accounts portrayed Carson as an American hero, but in scholarship of this period he became an arch-villain in the military campaigns against the Indians.
In 1992, for example, a young professor at Colorado College was successful in demanding that a period photograph of Carson be removed from the ROTC office.
In 1993, a symposium was organized to air various views on Carson, but the Navajo spokespeople refused to attend.
Over time, historical analysis of Carson shifted again.
David Roberts writes, "Carson's trajectory, over three and a half decades, from thoughtless killer of Apaches and Blackfeet to defender and champion of the Utes, marks him out as one of the few frontiersmen whose change of heart toward the Indians, born not of missionary theory but of first hand experience, can serve as an exemplar for the more enlightened policies that sporadically gained the day in the twentieth century."
Bill Williams played Kit Carson in the TV mini-series 1951-55 The Adventures of Kit Carson
Rip Torn played Carson in the 1986 miniseries "Dream West".
Carson was the inspiration for a same-named character in the popular Italian comic book series "Tex Willer".
Historian Hampton Sides said that Carson believed the Native Americans needed reservations as a way of physically separating and shielding them from white hostility and white culture.
He is said to have viewed the raids on white settlements as driven by desperation, "committed from absolute necessity when in a starving condition."
Indian hunting grounds were disappearing as waves of white settlers filled the region.
Despite the support of the Taos Pueblo and the residents of Taos Valley the park was not renamed and still bears the Kit Carson moniker.
