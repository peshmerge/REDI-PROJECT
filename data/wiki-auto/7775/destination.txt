Clara Petacci (28 February 1912 â€“ 28 April 1945) was the last mistress of Benito Mussolini, who was 28 years older.
She was born in Rome.
Mussolini tried to escape to Switzerland, with some of his helpers.
After being captured Petacci was given an opportunity to flee, which she declined.
She was shot, with the other prisoners.
It is possible that Petacci was raped before her death.
The bodies were then hung head down in Milan.
