In statistics and quantitative research methodology, a data sample is a set of data collected and the world selected from a statistical population by a defined procedure.
The elements of a sample are known as sample points, sampling units or observations.
Typically, the population is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the values in the population either impractical or impossible.
Samples are collected and statistics are calculated from the samples, so that one can make inferences or extrapolations from the sample to the population.
The data sample may be drawn from a population "without replacement" (i.e.
no element can be selected more than once in the same sample), in which case it is a subset of a population; or "with replacement" (i.e.
an element may appear multiple times in the one sample), in which case it is a multisubset.
A complete sample is a set of objects from a parent population that includes ALL such objects that satisfy a set of well-defined selection criteria.
So to compile such a complete sample requires a complete list of the parent population, including data on height, gender, and nationality for each member of that parent population.
But, such complete samples are often available in other disciplines such as the set of players in a major sports league, the birth dates of the members of a parliament, or a complete magnitude-limited list of astronomical objects.
An unbiased (representative) sample is a set of objects chosen from a complete sample using a selection process that does not depend on the properties of the objects.
But one chosen from the electoral register might not be unbiased since, for example, males aged under 18 will not be on the electoral register.
In an astronomical context, an unbiased sample might consist of that fraction of a complete sample for which data are available, provided the data availability is not biased by individual source properties.
The best way to avoid a biased or unrepresentative sample is to select a random sample, also known as a probability sample.
A random sample is defined as a sample where each individual member of the population has a known, non-zero chance of being selected as part of the sample.
