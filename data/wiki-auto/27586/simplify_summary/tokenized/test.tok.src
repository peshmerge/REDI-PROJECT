[CLS] in statistics and quantitative research methodology , a data sample is a set of data collected and the world selected from a statistical population by a defined procedure . [SEP]
[CLS] the elements of a sample are known as sample points , sampling units or observations . [SEP]
[CLS] typically , the population is very large , making a census or a complete en ##ume ##ration of all the values in the population either imp ##rac ##tical or impossible . [SEP]
[CLS] the sample usually represents a subset of manage ##able size . [SEP]
[CLS] samples are collected and statistics are calculated from the samples , so that one can make inference ##s or extra ##pol ##ations from the sample to the population . [SEP]
[CLS] the data sample may be drawn from a population " without replacement " ( i . e . no element can be selected more than once in the same sample ) , in which case it is a subset of a population ; or " with replacement " ( i . e . an element may appear multiple times in the one sample ) , in which case it is a multi ##su ##bs ##et . [SEP]
[CLS] a complete sample is a set of objects from a parent population that includes all such objects that satisfy a set of well - defined selection criteria . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , a complete sample of australian men taller than 2 ##m would consist of a list of every australian male taller than 2 ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] but it wouldn ' t include german males , or tall australian females , or people shorter than 2 ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] so to com ##pile such a complete sample requires a complete list of the parent population , including data on height , gender , and nationality for each member of that parent population . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of human populations , such a complete list is unlikely to exist ( the human population being in the billions ) . [SEP]
[CLS] but , such complete samples are often available in other disciplines such as the set of players in a major sports league , the birth dates of the members of a parliament , or a complete magnitude - limited list of astronomical objects . [SEP]
[CLS] an un ##bia ##sed ( representative ) sample is a set of objects chosen from a complete sample using a selection process that does not depend on the properties of the objects . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , an un ##bia ##sed sample of australian men taller than 2 ##m might consist of a randomly sampled subset of 1 % of australian males taller than 2 ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] but one chosen from the electoral register might not be un ##bia ##sed since , for example , males aged under 18 will not be on the electoral register . [SEP]
[CLS] in an astronomical context , an un ##bia ##sed sample might consist of that fraction of a complete sample for which data are available , provided the data availability is not biased by individual source properties . [SEP]
[CLS] the best way to avoid a biased or un ##re ##pres ##ent ##ative sample is to select a random sample , also known as a probability sample . [SEP]
[CLS] a random sample is defined as a sample where each individual member of the population has a known , non - zero chance of being selected as part of the sample . [SEP]
[CLS] several types of random samples are simple random samples , systematic samples , st ##rat ##ified random samples , and cluster random samples . [SEP]
[CLS] a sample that is not random is called a non - random sample or a non - probability sampling . [SEP]
[CLS] some examples of non ##rand ##om samples are convenience samples , judgment samples , pu ##rp ##osi ##ve samples , quota samples , snow ##ball samples , and quad ##rat ##ure nodes in quasi - monte carlo methods . [SEP]
[CLS] in mathematical terms , given a probability distribution " f " , a random sample of length " n " ( where " n " may be any positive integer ) is a set of realization ##s of " n " independent , identical ##ly distributed ( ii ##d ) random variables with distribution " f " . [SEP]
[CLS] a sample concrete ##ly represents the results of " n " experiments in which the same quantity is measured . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , if we want to estimate the average height of members of a particular population , we measure the heights of " n " individuals . [SEP]
[CLS] each measurement is drawn from the probability distribution " f " character ##izing the population , so each measured height formula _ 1 is the realization of a random variable formula _ 2 with distribution " f " . [SEP]
[CLS] note that a set of random variables ( i . e . , a set of me ##asurable functions ) must not be confused with the realization ##s of these variables ( which are the values that these random variables take ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , formula _ 2 is a function representing the measurement at the " i " - th experiment and formula _ 4 is the value obtained when making the measurement . [SEP]
