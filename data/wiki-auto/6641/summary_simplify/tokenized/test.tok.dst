[CLS] the cane toad ( " rhine ##lla marina " ) , also known as the giant neo ##tropical toad or marine toad , is a large , terrestrial true toad native to south and mainland central america , but which has been introduced to various islands throughout oceania and the caribbean , as well as northern australia . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a member of the genus " rhine ##lla " , but was formerly assigned to the genus " bu ##fo " , which includes many true toad species found throughout central and south america . [SEP]
[CLS] the cane toad is a prolific breed ##er ; females lay single - cl ##ump spawn ##s with thousands of eggs . [SEP]
[CLS] adults average 10 – in length ; the largest recorded specimen had a snout - vent length of 24 cm . [SEP]
[CLS] a fossil toad ( specimen uc ##mp 411 ##59 ) from the la vent ##a fauna of the late miocene of colombia is ind ##ist ##ing ##uis ##hab ##le from modern cane toad ##s from northern south america . [SEP]
[CLS] it was discovered in a flood ##pl ##ain deposit , which suggests the " r . marina " habitat preferences have long been for open areas . [SEP]
[CLS] because of its vo ##rac ##ious appetite , the cane toad has been introduced to many regions of the pacific and the caribbean islands as a method of agricultural pest control . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , the cane toad ##s were used to era ##dicate pest ##s from sugarcane , giving rise to their common name . [SEP]
[CLS] the cane toad has many other common names , including " giant toad " and " marine toad " ; the former refers to its size , and the latter to the bin ##omi ##al name , " r . marina " . [SEP]
[CLS] linnaeus based the specific epithet " marina " on an illustration by dutch zoo ##logist albert ##us se ##ba , who mistakenly believed the cane toad to inhabit both terrestrial and marine environments . [SEP]
[CLS] in this case , the specific name " marin ##us " ( masculine ) changes to " marina " ( feminine ) to conform with the rules of gender agreement as set out by the international code of zoological nomenclature , changing the bin ##omi ##al name from " bu ##fo marin ##us " to " rhine ##lla marina " ; the bin ##omi ##al " rhine ##lla marin ##us " was subsequently introduced as a synonym through miss ##pel ##ling by pr ##am ##uk , robertson , sites , and noon ##an ( 2008 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] though controversial ( with many traditional her ##pet ##ologists still using " bu ##fo marin ##us " ) the bin ##omi ##al " rhine ##lla marina " is gaining in acceptance with such bodies as the iucn , en ##cy ##cl ##opa ##ed ##ia of life , amp ##hi ##bian species of the world and increasing numbers of scientific publications adopting its usage . [SEP]
[CLS] cane toad ##s have been confused with the giant burr ##owing frog ( " he ##lei ##op ##orus australia ##cus " ) , because both are large and war ##ty in appearance ; however , the latter can be readily distinguished from the former by its vertical pupils and its silver - grey ( as opposed to gold ) iris ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] juvenile cane toad ##s may be confused with species of the genus " up ##ero ##lei ##a " , but their adult colleagues can be distinguished by the lack of bright colour ##ing on the groin and thighs . [SEP]
[CLS] in particular , it could be confused with the southern toad ( " bu ##fo terre ##st ##ris " ) , which can be distinguished by the presence of two bulbs in front of the par ##oto ##id glands . [SEP]
[CLS] the cane toad genome has been sequence ##d and certain australian academics believe this will help in understanding how the toad can quickly evolve to adapt to new environments , the workings of its infamous toxin , and hopefully give us new options for halt ##ing this species ’ march across australia and other places it has spread as an invasive pest .
