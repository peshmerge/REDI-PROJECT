the mercalli intensity scale is a scale from the mercalli intensity of the earthquake .
earthquakes are different in how much of their energy is radiated as seismic waves .
it can be amplified in sedimentary basins and certain kinds of unconsolidated soils .
intensity scales make the intensity of shaking based on the effects reported by untrained observers .
the greatest intensities generally correspond to the epicentral area .
it is now " more or less forgotten " .
mercalli 's second scale was published in 1902 .
this version " found favour with the users " , and was adopted by the italian central office of meteorology and geodynamics .
in 1904 adolfo cancani proposed adding two additional degrees for very strong earthquakes , " catastrophe " and " enormous catastrophe " , thus creating the 12 degree scale .
some seismologists prefer to call this version the wood-neumann scale .
the wood â€“ neumann scale was revised in 1956 by charles francis richter .
in their 1993 compendium of historical seismicity in the united states , carl stover and jerry coffman ignored richter 's revision , and assigned intensities according to their slightly modified interpretation of wood and neumann 's 1931 scale , effectively creating a new but largely undocumented version of the scale .
however , this is generally interpreted with the modifications summarized by stover and coffman because in the decades since 1931 it has been found that " some criteria are more reliable than others as indicators of the level of ground shaking . "
also , construction codes and methods have evolved , making much of built environment stronger ; these make a given intensity of ground shaking seem weaker .
some of the original criteria of the higher degrees arbore x and aboveability , such as bent rails , ground fissures , landslides , etc . , are " related less to the level of ground shaking than to the presence of ground conditions susceptible to spectacular failure . "
the " catastrophe " and " enormous catastrophe " categories are used so infrequently that current usgs practice is merge them into a single " extreme " labeled " x + " .
this table gives modified mercalli scale intensities that are typically observed at locations near the epicenter of the earthquake .
there is a correlation between the intensity of the earthquake and the intensity of the earthquake .
the colors and descriptive names shown here are different from those used on certain shake maps in articles .
dozens of so-called intensity prediction equations have been published to estimate the macroseismic intensity at a location given the magnitude , source-to-site distance and , perhaps other parameters thereof .
these equations can be used to estimate the seismic hazard in terms of macroseismic intensity .
human-perceived shaking and building damages are best correlated with peak acceleration for lower-intensity events , and with peak velocity for higher-intensity events .
the effects of any one earthquake can vary greatly from place to place , so there may be many mercalli intensity values measured for the same earthquake .
