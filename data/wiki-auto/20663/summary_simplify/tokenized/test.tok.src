[CLS] the modified mer ##cal ##li intensity scale ( mm or mm ##i ) , descended from giuseppe mer ##cal ##li ' s mer ##cal ##li intensity scale of 1902 , is a seismic intensity scale used for measuring the " intensity of shaking " produced by an earthquake . [SEP]
[CLS] while shaking is driven by the seismic energy released by an earthquake , earthquakes differ in how much of their energy is radiated as seismic waves . [SEP]
[CLS] shaking intensity is localized , generally dim ##ini ##shing with distance from the earthquake ' s epic ##enter , but can be amplified in sedimentary basins and certain kinds of un ##con ##sol ##ida ##ted soils . [SEP]
[CLS] intensity scales empirical ##ly cat ##ego ##rize the intensity of shaking based on the effects reported by un ##train ##ed observers , and are adapted for the effects that might be observed in a particular region . [SEP]
[CLS] in not requiring instrumental measurements , they are useful for est ##imating the magnitude and location of historical ( pre - instrumental ) earthquakes : the greatest int ##ens ##ities generally correspond to the epic ##ent ##ral area , and their degree and extent ( possibly augmented with knowledge of local geological conditions ) can be compared with other local earthquakes to estimate the magnitude . [SEP]
[CLS] it had six degrees or categories , has been described as " merely an adaptation " of the then standard rossi – fore ##l scale of ten degrees , and is now " more or less forgotten . " [SEP]
[CLS] mer ##cal ##li ' s second scale , published in 1902 , was also an adaptation of the rossi ‒ fore ##l scale , retaining the ten degrees and expanding the descriptions of each degree . [SEP]
[CLS] this version " found favour with the users " , and was adopted by the italian central office of meteor ##ology and geo ##dy ##nami ##cs . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1904 adolf ##o can ##can ##i proposed adding two additional degrees for very strong earthquakes , " catastrophe " and " enormous catastrophe " , thus creating the 12 degree scale . [SEP]
[CLS] some se ##ism ##ologists prefer to call this version the " wood – neumann scale " . ) [SEP]
[CLS] the wood – neumann scale was revised in 1956 by charles francis richter and published in his influential textbook " elementary se ##ism ##ology " . [SEP]
[CLS] in their 1993 com ##pen ##dium of historical seismic ##ity in the united states , carl stove ##r and jerry co ##ff ##man ignored richter ' s revision , and assigned int ##ens ##ities according to their slightly modified interpretation of wood and neumann ' s 1931 scale , effectively creating a new but largely undo ##cum ##ented version of the scale . [SEP]
[CLS] however , this is generally interpreted with the modifications summarized by stove ##r and co ##ff ##man because in the decades since 1931 it has been found that " some criteria are more reliable than others as indicators of the level of ground shaking . " [SEP]
[CLS] also , construction codes and methods have evolved , making much of built environment stronger ; these make a given intensity of ground shaking seem weaker . [SEP]
[CLS] and it is now recognized that some of the original criteria of the higher degrees ( x and above ) , such as bent rails , ground fis ##sure ##s , landslide ##s , etc . , are " related less to the level of ground shaking than to the presence of ground conditions susceptible to spectacular failure . . . " [SEP]
[CLS] the " catastrophe " and " enormous catastrophe " categories added by can ##can ##i ( xi and xii ) are used so in ##fr ##e ##quent ##ly that current us ##gs practice is merge them into a single " extreme " labeled " x + " . [SEP]
[CLS] this table gives modified mer ##cal ##li scale int ##ens ##ities that are typically observed at locations near the epic ##enter of the earthquake . [SEP]
[CLS] the correlation between magnitude and intensity is far from total , depending upon several factors including the depth of the h ##yp ##oc ##enter , terrain , distance from the epic ##enter . [SEP]
[CLS] the colors and descriptive names shown here differ from those used on certain shake maps in other articles . [SEP]
[CLS] dozens of so - called intensity prediction equations have been published to estimate the macro ##sei ##sm ##ic intensity at a location given the magnitude , source - to - site distance and , perhaps , other parameters ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] such equations can be used to estimate the seismic hazard in terms of macro ##sei ##sm ##ic intensity , which has the advantage of being more closely related to seismic risk than instrumental strong - motion parameters . [SEP]
[CLS] human - perceived shaking and building damages are best correlated with peak acceleration for lower - intensity events , and with peak velocity for higher - intensity events . [SEP]
[CLS] the effects of any one earthquake can vary greatly from place to place , so there may be many mer ##cal ##li intensity values measured for the same earthquake . [SEP]
