[CLS] article two of the united states constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government , which carries out and enforce ##s federal laws . [SEP]
[CLS] article two vest ##s the power of the executive branch in the office of the president of the united states , lays out the procedures for elect ##ing and removing the president , and establishes the president ' s powers and responsibilities . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 of article two establishes the positions of the president and the vice president , and sets the term of both offices at four years . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 ' s vest ##ing clause declares that the executive power of the federal government is vested in the president and , along with the vest ##ing clauses of article one and article three , establishes the separation of powers between the three branches of government . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 also establishes the electoral college , the body charged with elect ##ing the president and the vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 provides that each state chooses members of the electoral college in a manner directed by each state ' s respective legislature , with the states granted electors equal to their combined representation in both houses of congress . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 lays out the procedures of the electoral college and requires the house of representatives to hold a contingent election to select the president if no individual wins a majority of the electoral vote . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 also sets forth the eligibility requirements for the office of the president , provides procedures in case of a presidential vacancy , and requires the president to take an oath of office . [SEP]
[CLS] section 2 of article two lays out the powers of the presidency , establishing that the president serves as the commander - in - chief of the military and has the power to grant pardon ##s and require the " principal officer " of any executive department to tender advice . [SEP]
[CLS] though not required by article two , president george washington organized the principal officers of the executive departments into the cabinet , a practice that subsequent presidents have followed . [SEP]
[CLS] the treaty clause grants the president the power to enter into treaties with the approval of two - thirds of the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] the appointments clause grants the president the power to appoint judges and public officials subject to the advice and consent of the senate , which in practice has meant that presidential appoint ##ees must be confirmed by a majority vote in the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] the appointments clause also establishes that congress can , by law , allow the president , the courts , or the heads of departments to appoint " inferior officers " without requiring the advice and consent of the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] the final clause of section 2 grants the president the power to make recess appointments to fill va ##can ##cies that occur when the senate is in recess . [SEP]
[CLS] section 3 of article two lays out the responsibilities of the president , granting the president the power to con ##ven ##e both houses of congress , receive foreign representatives , and commission all federal officers . [SEP]
[CLS] section 3 requires the president to inform congress of the " state of the union " ; since 1913 this has taken the form of a speech referred to as the state of the union . [SEP]
[CLS] the recommendation clause requires the president to recommend measures s / he dee ##ms " necessary and ex ##ped ##ient . " [SEP]
[CLS] the take care clause requires the president to obey and enforce all laws , though the president retains some discretion in interpreting the laws and determining how to enforce them . [SEP]
[CLS] section 4 of article two establishes that the president and other officers can be removed from office through the imp ##ea ##chment process , which is further described in article one . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 begins with a vest ##ing clause that con ##fers federal executive power upon the president . [SEP]
[CLS] similar clauses are found in article i and article iii . [SEP]
[CLS] the former best ##ows federal legislative power exclusively to congress , and the latter grants judicial power solely to the supreme court , and other federal courts established by law . [SEP]
[CLS] these three articles create a separation of powers among the three branches of the federal government . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to separation of powers and equally important to limited government , each independent and sovereign branch also provides checks and balance ##s on the operation and power of the other two branches . [SEP]
[CLS] the president ' s executive power is subject to two important limitations . [SEP]
[CLS] first , the president lacks executive authority explicitly granted to congress . [SEP]
[CLS] hence the president cannot declare war , grant letters of mar ##que and rep ##ris ##al , or regulate commerce , even though executives had often wi ##eld ##ed such authority in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] in these instances , congress retained portions of the executive power that the continental congress had wi ##eld ##ed under the articles of confederation . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , because those actions require legislation passed by congress which must be signed by the president to take effect , those powers are not strictly executive powers granted to or retained by congress per se . [SEP]
[CLS] nor were they retained by the u . s . congress as left ##overs from the articles of confederation . [SEP]
[CLS] the articles of confederation , continental congress and its powers were abolished at the time the new u . s . congress was seated and the new federal government formally and officially replaced its interim predecessor . [SEP]
[CLS] and although the president is implicit ##ly denied the power to un ##ila ##tera ##lly declare war , a declaration of war is not in and of itself a vehicle of executive power since it is literally just a public declaration that the u . s . government considers itself " at war " with a foreign political entity . [SEP]
[CLS] regardless of the inability to declare war , the president does have the power to un ##ila ##tera ##lly order military action in defense of the united states pursuant to " a national emergency created by attack upon the united states , its territories or possessions , or its armed forces " . [SEP]
[CLS] by u . s . law , this power is limited in that he must not ##ify congress within 48 hours after the beginning of military operations , explaining the source of his authority for the action . [SEP]
[CLS] once proper legal notification is given to the required members of congress , military action can continue for up to 60 days without further authorization from congress , or up to 90 days if the president " determines and ce ##rti ##fies to the congress in writing that una ##vo ##ida ##ble military necessity respecting the safety of united states armed forces requires the continued use of such armed forces in the course of bringing about a prompt removal of such forces . " [SEP]
[CLS] second , specific constitutional provisions may check customary executive authority . [SEP]
[CLS] notwithstanding their executive power , the president cannot make treaties or appointments without the advice and consent of the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , the president ' s pardon power is limited to offenses against the united states ( federal crimes ) and does not extend to imp ##ea ##chment ##s or violations of state law . [SEP]
[CLS] as treaties are by u . s . law official agreements with foreign governments recognized as such only after senate ratification , the president obviously cannot make treaties un ##ila ##tera ##lly . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the president does determine and decide u . s . foreign policy , and can enter into non - binding discussions and give conditional approval to agreements reached with foreign governments subject to senate ratification at a future date . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , since official treaties are specifically created under and by constitutional u . s . law , and are entered into by both government and the people as a whole , in their capacity as head of state and as the single individual representative of the united states and its citizens , the president does have coa ##uth ##ori ##ty and constitutional duty to un ##ila ##tera ##lly withdraw the united states from treaties if he or she determines the best interests and well being of the u . s . and its citizens are benefited by doing so . [SEP]
[CLS] as far as presidential appointments , as with treaties a person is not officially and legally appointed to a position until their appointment is approved by the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] prior to senate approval and publication of that approval along with an official date and time for their swearing - in and assumption of duties and responsibilities , they are nominees rather than appoint ##ees . [SEP]
[CLS] and again , the president nominate ##s people for specific positions at their pleasure and can do so without or in spite of senate advice . [SEP]
[CLS] senate consent occurs when a majority of senators votes to approve and therefore appoint a nominee . [SEP]
[CLS] the head of the executive branch is the president . [SEP]
[CLS] although also named in this first clause , the vice president is not constitutional ##ly vested with any executive power . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , the constitution di ##cta ##tes that the president and vice president are to be elected at the same time , for the same term , and by the same constituency . [SEP]
[CLS] the frame ##rs ' intent was to preserve the independence of the executive branch should the person who was vice president succeed to the duties of the presidency . [SEP]
[CLS] under the u . s . constitution the president and vice president are chosen by electors , under a constitutional grant of authority delegate ##d to the legislatures of the several states . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution reserves the choice of the precise manner for creating electors to the will of the state legislatures . [SEP]
[CLS] it does not define or del ##imi ##t what process a state legislature may use to create its " state " college of electors . [SEP]
[CLS] in practice , the state legislatures have generally chosen to create electors through an indirect popular vote , since the 1820s . [SEP]
[CLS] most states have a " winner - take - all " system in which the candidate with the most votes in the state gets all the electoral votes . [SEP]
[CLS] maine and nebraska allow individual congressional districts to elect one elector . [SEP]
[CLS] in an indirect popular vote , it is the names of the candidates who are on the ballot to be elected . [SEP]
[CLS] most states do not put the names of the electors on the ballot . [SEP]
[CLS] it is generally understood by the voters and the electors themselves that they are the representative " stand - ins " for the candidates and are expected to cast their electoral college ballots for the president and vice president who appeared on the ballot . [SEP]
[CLS] the actual electors being voted for are usually selected by the candidate ' s party . [SEP]
[CLS] there are a few cases where some electors have refused to vote for the designated candidate . [SEP]
[CLS] many states have mandated in law that electors " shall " cast their electoral college ballot for the designated presidential candidate . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitutional ##ity of such mandates is uncertain . [SEP]
[CLS] each state chooses as many electors as it has representatives and senators representing it in congress . [SEP]
[CLS] under the 23rd amendment , the district of columbia may choose no more electors than the state with the lowest number of electoral votes ( in effect , three electors ) , although since that amendment ' s ratification the district ' s population has never reached the threshold that would otherwise en ##ti ##tle it to choose four or more electors . [SEP]
[CLS] while senators , representatives and federal officers are barred from becoming electors , in practice the two major federal parties frequently select senior officials at the state level ( up to and including governors ) to serve as electors . [SEP]
[CLS] in modern practice , each state chooses its electors in popular elections . [SEP]
[CLS] once chosen , the electors meet in their respective states to cast ballots for the president and vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] originally , each elector cast two votes for president ; at least one of the individuals voted for had to be from a state different from the elector ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] the individual with the majority of votes became president , and the runner - up became vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] in case of a tie between candidates who received votes from a majority of electors , the house of representatives would choose one of the tied candidates ; if no person received a majority , then the house could again choose one of the five with the greatest number of votes . [SEP]
[CLS] when the house voted , each state delegation cast one vote , and the vote of a majority of states was necessary to choose a president . [SEP]
[CLS] if second - place candidates were tied , then the senate broke the tie . [SEP]
[CLS] a quo ##rum in the house consisted of at least one member from two - thirds of the state delegation ##s ; there was no special quo ##rum for the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] this procedure was followed in 1801 after the electoral vote produced a tie , and nearly resulted in a dead ##lock in the house . [SEP]
[CLS] while the constitution reflects the frame ##rs ' clear preference for the president to be elected by a constituency independent of the congress , one of the most pal ##pa ##ble limitations created by the st ##ip ##ulation that electors meet in their respective states as opposed to a single venue was that given the constraints of eighteenth - century technology there was no practical means for that constituency to resolve dead ##lock ##ed elections in a timely manner , thus nec ##ess ##itating the involvement of congress in resolving dead ##lock ##ed elections . [SEP]
[CLS] obviously , having the electors meet in the national capital or some other single venue could have permitted the electors to choose a president by means of an exhaust ##ive ballot without congressional involvement , but the frame ##rs were di ##ss ##ua ##ded from such an arrangement by two major considerations . [SEP]
[CLS] first , it would have been quite burden ##some for electors from distant states to travel to the national capital using eighteenth century means for the sole purpose of elect ##ing the president – since they were to be barred from simultaneously serving in the federal government in any other capacity , electors would likely have no other reason to go there . [SEP]
[CLS] but probably even more importantly , many frame ##rs genuinely feared that if the electors met in a single venue , especially under the initial assumption that they would act independently as opposed to being bound to vote for particular candidates , they would be vulnerable to the influence of mob ##s who might try to ensure a particular result by means of threats and intimidation – this had been a fairly common occurrence in european elections for powerful officials by relatively small constituencies ( for example , and perhaps in particular , in papal elections ) from the middle ages up to the constitution ' s creation . [SEP]
[CLS] the 12th amendment introduced a number of important changes to the procedure . [SEP]
[CLS] now , electors do not cast two votes for president ; rather , they cast one vote for president and another for vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] in case no presidential candidate receives a majority , the house chooses from the top three ( not five , as before the 12th amendment ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the amendment also requires the senate to choose the vice president from those with the two highest figures if no vice presidential candidate receives a majority of electoral votes ( rather than only if there ' s a tie for second for president ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it also st ##ip ##ulates that to be the vice president , a person must be qualified to be the president . [SEP]
[CLS] congress sets a national election day . [SEP]
[CLS] currently , electors are chosen on the tuesday following the first monday in november ( the first tuesday after november 1 ) , in the year before the president ' s term is to ex ##pire . [SEP]
[CLS] the electors cast their votes on the monday following the second wednesday in december ( the first monday after december 12 ) of that year . [SEP]
[CLS] thereafter , the votes are opened and counted by the vice president , as president of the senate , in a joint session of congress . [SEP]
[CLS] the word ##ing of this clause caused much controversy at the time it was first used . [SEP]
[CLS] when william henry harrison died in office , a debate arose over whether the vice president would become president , or if he would just inherit the powers , thus becoming an acting president . [SEP]
[CLS] harrison ' s vice president , john tyler , believed that he had the right to become president . [SEP]
[CLS] however , many senators argued that he only had the right to assume the powers of the presidency long enough to call for a new election . [SEP]
[CLS] because the word ##ing of the clause is so vague , it was impossible for either side to prove its point . [SEP]
[CLS] tyler took the oath of office as president , setting a precedent that made it possible for later vice presidents to as ##cend to the presidency un ##chal ##len ##ged following the president ' s death . [SEP]
[CLS] the " tyler precedent " established that if the president dies , resign ##s or is removed from office , the vice president becomes president . [SEP]
[CLS] the congress may provide for a line of succession beyond the vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] the current presidential succession act establishes the order as the speaker of the house of representatives , the president " pro tempo ##re " of the senate and then the fifteen cabinet secretaries in order of each department ' s establishment . [SEP]
[CLS] there are concerns regarding the constitutional ##ity of having members of congress in the line of succession , however , as this clause specifies that only an " officer of the united states " may be designated as a presidential successor . [SEP]
[CLS] constitutional scholars from james madison to the present day have argued that the term " officer " exclude ##s members of congress . [SEP]
[CLS] the 25th amendment explicitly states that if the president dies , resign ##s or is removed from office , the vice president becomes president , and also establishes a procedure for filling a vacancy in the office of the vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] the amendment further provides that the president , or the vice president and cabinet , can declare the president unable to discharge his duties , in which case the vice president becomes acting president . [SEP]
[CLS] if the declaration is done by the vice president and cabinet , the amendment permits the president to take control back , unless the vice president and cabinet challenge the president and two - thirds of both houses vote to sustain the findings of the vice president and cabinet . [SEP]
[CLS] if the declaration is done by the president , he may take control back without risk of being over ##rid ##den by the congress . [SEP]
[CLS] the president ' s salary , currently $ 400 , 000 a year , must remain constant throughout the president ' s term . [SEP]
[CLS] the president may not receive other compensation from either the federal or any state government . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the joint congressional committee on presidential inauguration ##s , george washington added the words " so help me god " during his first inaugural , though this has been disputed . [SEP]
[CLS] there are no con ##tem ##por ##aneous sources for this fact , and no eye ##wi ##tness sources to washington ' s first inaugural mention the phrase at all — including those that transcribed what he said for his oath . [SEP]
[CLS] also , the president - elect ' s name is typically added after the " i " , for example , " i , george washington , do . . . " normally , the chief justice of the united states administer ##s the oath . [SEP]
[CLS] it is sometimes asserted that the oath best ##ows upon the president the power to do whatever is necessary to " preserve , protect and defend the constitution . " [SEP]
[CLS] andrew jackson , while veto ##ing an act for the renewal of the charter of the national bank , implied that the president could refuse to execute statutes that he felt were unconstitutional . [SEP]
[CLS] in suspend ##ing the privilege of the writ of " ha ##be ##as corpus " , president abraham lincoln claimed that he acted according to the oath . [SEP]
[CLS] his action was challenged in court and overturned by the u . s . circuit court in maryland ( led by chief justice roger b . tan ##ey ) in " ex part ##e merry ##man " , 17 f . cas . [SEP]
[CLS] 144 ( c . c . d . md . 1861 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] lincoln ignored tan ##ey ' s order . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , andrew johnson ' s counsel referred to the theory during his imp ##ea ##chment trial . [SEP]
[CLS] otherwise , few have seriously asserted that the oath aug ##ments the president ' s powers . [SEP]
[CLS] the vice president also has an oath of office , but it is not mandated by the constitution and is prescribed by statute . [SEP]
[CLS] currently , the vice presidential oath is the same as that for members of congress . [SEP]
[CLS] i do solemnly swear ( or af ##firm ) that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies , foreign and domestic ; that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same ; that i take this obligation freely , without any mental reservation or purpose of eva ##sion ; and that i will well and faithful ##ly discharge the duties of the office on which i am about to enter . [SEP]
[CLS] so help me god . [SEP]
[CLS] in the landmark decision " nixon v . general services administration " , justice william re ##hn ##quist , afterwards the chief justice , declared in his dissent the need to " fully describe the pre ##emi ##nent position that the president of the united states occupies with respect to our republic . [SEP]
[CLS] su ##ffi ##ce it to say that the president is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the united states , and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are indeed a powerful and incredible responsibility but as well as a great honor . " [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution vest ##s the president with executive power . [SEP]
[CLS] that power reaches its zenith when wi ##eld ##ed to protect national security . [SEP]
[CLS] and federal courts in the united states must pay proper def ##erence to the executive in assessing the threats that face the nation . [SEP]
[CLS] the president is the military ' s commander - in - chief ; however article one gives congress and not the president the exclusive right to declare war . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , the power of the president to initiate hostilities has been subject to question . [SEP]
[CLS] according to historian thomas woods , " ever since the korean war , article ii , section 2 . . . has been interpreted ' the president has the power to initiate hostilities without consulting congress ' . . . but what the frame ##rs actually meant by that clause was that once war has been declared , it was the president ’ s responsibility as commander - in - chief to direct the war . [SEP]
[CLS] alexander hamilton spoke in such terms when he said that the president , although lacking the power to declare war , would have " the direction of war when authorized or begun . " [SEP]
[CLS] the president acting alone was authorized only to rep ##el sudden attacks ( hence the decision to with ##hold from him only the power to " declare " war , not to " make " war , which was thought to be a necessary emergency power in case of foreign attack ) . [SEP]
[CLS] since world war ii , every major military action has been technically a u . s . military operation or a u . n . " police action " , which are deemed legally legitimate by congress , and various united nations resolutions because of decisions such as the gulf of ton ##kin resolution or the resolution of the congress providing authorization for use of force in iraq . [SEP]
[CLS] the president may require the " principal officer " of any executive department to tender his advice in writing . [SEP]
[CLS] while the constitution nowhere requires a formal cabinet , it does author ##ize the president to seek advice from the principal officers of the various departments as he ( or she ) performs their official duties . [SEP]
[CLS] george washington found it pr ##ude ##nt to organize his principal officers into a cabinet , and it has been part of the executive branch structure ever since . [SEP]
[CLS] presidents have used cabinet meetings of selected principal officers but to widely differing extent ##s and for different purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] secretary of state william h . se ##ward advocated the use of a parliamentary - style cabinet government to president abraham lincoln , but was re ##bu ##ffed . [SEP]
[CLS] later , woodrow wilson advocated use of a parliamentary - style cabinet while he was a professor , but as president he would have none of it in his administration . [SEP]
[CLS] in recent administrations , cabinets have grown to include key white house staff in addition to department and agency heads . [SEP]
[CLS] president ronald reagan formed seven sub ##ca ##bine ##t councils to review many policy issues , and subsequent presidents have followed that practice . [SEP]
[CLS] the president , furthermore , may grant pardon or rep ##rie ##ves , except in cases of imp ##ea ##chment . [SEP]
[CLS] as ruled by the supreme court in " united states v . wilson " ( 1833 ) , the pardon could be rejected by the convict . [SEP]
[CLS] then , in " bu ##rdi ##ck v . united states " ( 1915 ) , the court specifically said , " circumstances may be made to bring innocence under the penalties of the law . [SEP]
[CLS] if so brought , escape by confession of guilt implied in the acceptance of a pardon may be rejected , preferring to be the victim of the law rather than its acknowledged trans ##gre ##sso ##r , preferring death even to such certain in ##fa ##my . " [SEP]
[CLS] com ##mut ##ations ( reduction in prison sentence ) , unlike pardon ##s ( restoration of civil rights after prison sentence had been served ) may not be refused . [SEP]
[CLS] in " bid ##dle v . per ##ovich " 274 u . s . 480 ( 1927 ) , the subject of the com ##mut ##ation did not want to accept life in prison but wanted the death penalty restored . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court said , " a pardon in our days is not a private act of grace from an individual happening to possess power . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a part of the constitutional scheme . [SEP]
[CLS] when granted it is the determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by in ##flict ##ing less than what the judgment fixed . " [SEP]
[CLS] the president exercises the powers in the advice and consent clause with the advice and consent of the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] the president may enter the united states into treaties , but they are not effective until ratified by a two - thirds vote in the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] in article ii however , the constitution is not very explicit about the termination of treaties . [SEP]
[CLS] the first ab ##ro ##gation of a treaty occurred in 1798 , when congress passed a law terminating a 1778 treaty of alliance with france . [SEP]
[CLS] in the nineteenth century , several presidents terminated treaties after congress passed resolutions requesting the same . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1854 , however , president franklin pierce terminated a treaty with denmark with the consent of the senate alone . [SEP]
[CLS] a senate committee ruled that it was correct procedure for the president to terminate treaties after being authorized by the senate alone , and not the entire congress . [SEP]
[CLS] president pierce ' s successors , however , returned to the former procedure of obtaining authorization from both houses . [SEP]
[CLS] some presidents have claimed to themselves the exclusive power of terminating treaties . [SEP]
[CLS] the first una ##mb ##ig ##uous case of a president terminating a treaty without authorization , granted prior to or after the termination , occurred when jimmy carter terminated a treaty with the republic of china . [SEP]
[CLS] for the first time , judicial determination was sought , but the effort proved futile : the supreme court could not find a majority agreeing on any particular principle , and therefore instructed the trial court to dismiss the case . [SEP]
[CLS] the president may also appoint judges , ambassadors , consul ##s , ministers and other officers with the advice and consent of the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] by law , however , congress may allow the president , heads of executive departments , or the courts to appoint inferior officials . [SEP]
[CLS] the senate has a long - standing practice of permitting motions to rec ##ons ##ider previous decisions . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1931 , the senate granted advice and consent to the president on the appointment of a member of the federal power commission . [SEP]
[CLS] the officer in question was sworn in , but the senate , under the guise of a motion to rec ##ons ##ider , res ##cin ##ded the advice and consent . [SEP]
[CLS] in the writ of quo warrant ##o proceedings that followed , the supreme court ruled that the senate was not permitted to res ##cin ##d advice and consent after the officer had been installed . [SEP]
[CLS] after the senate grants advice and consent , however , the president is under no compulsion to commission the officer . [SEP]
[CLS] it has not been settled whether the president has the pre ##ro ##gative to with ##hold a commission after having signed it . [SEP]
[CLS] this issue played a large part in the famous court case " mar ##bury v . madison " . [SEP]
[CLS] at times the president has asserted the power to remove individuals from office . [SEP]
[CLS] congress has often explicitly limited the president ' s power to remove ; during the reconstruction era , congress passed the tenure of office act , purported ##ly preventing andrew johnson from removing , without the advice and consent of the senate , anyone appointed with the advice and consent of the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] president johnson ignored the act , and was later imp ##ea ##ched and acquitted . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitutional ##ity of the act was not immediately settled . [SEP]
[CLS] in " myers v . united states " , the supreme court held that congress could not limit the president ' s power to remove an executive officer ( the postmaster general ) , but in " humphrey ' s ex ##ec ##uto ##r v . united states " , it upheld congress ' s authority to restrict the president ' s power to remove officers of the federal trade commission , an " administrative body that cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive . " [SEP]
[CLS] congress may repeal the legislation that author ##izes the appointment of an executive officer . [SEP]
[CLS] but it " cannot reserve for itself the power of an officer charged with the execution of the laws except by imp ##ea ##chment . " [SEP]
[CLS] congress has from time to time changed the number of justices in the supreme court . [SEP]
[CLS] during recess ##es of the senate , the president may appoint officers , but their commissions ex ##pire at the conclusion of the senate ' s next session . [SEP]
[CLS] the president must give the congress information on the " state of the union " " from time to time . " [SEP]
[CLS] this is called the state of the union clause . [SEP]
[CLS] originally , presidents personally delivered annual addresses to congress . [SEP]
[CLS] thomas jefferson , who felt that the procedure resembled the speech from the throne delivered by british monarchs , chose instead to send written messages to congress for reading by clerks . [SEP]
[CLS] jefferson ' s procedure was followed by future presidents until woodrow wilson reverted to the former procedure of personally addressing congress , which has continued to this day . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##sa ##van and sid ##ak explain the purpose of the state of the union clause : the state of the union clause impose ##s an executive duty on the president . [SEP]
[CLS] that duty must be discharged periodically . [SEP]
[CLS] the president ' s assessment of the state of the union must be publicized to congress , and thus to the nation . [SEP]
[CLS] the publication of the president ' s assessment convey ##s information to congress — information uniquely g ##lean ##ed from the president ' s perspective in his various roles as commander - in - chief , chief law enforce ##r , ne ##go ##tia ##tor with foreign powers , and the like — that shall aid the legislature in public del ##ibe ##ration on matters that may justify the enactment of legislation because of their national importance . [SEP]
[CLS] the president has the power and duty to recommend , for the consideration of congress , such measures which the president dee ##ms as " necessary and ex ##ped ##ient " . [SEP]
[CLS] at his inauguration george washington declared in his : " by the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the president ' to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and ex ##ped ##ient . ' " [SEP]
[CLS] this is the recommendation clause . [SEP]
[CLS] the recommendation clause also impose ##s an executive duty on the president . [SEP]
[CLS] his recommendations respect the equal dignity of congress and thus em ##body the anti - royalty sentiment that ignited the american revolution and subsequently stripped the trapping ##s of monarchy away from the new chief executive . [SEP]
[CLS] through his recommendations to congress , the president speaks collectively for the people as they petition government for a red ##ress of gr ##ie ##vances , and thus his recommendations em ##body popular sovereignty . [SEP]
[CLS] the president tailor ##s his recommendations so that their natural implication is the enactment of new legislation , rather than some other action that congress might undertake . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , the president shall have executive discretion to recommend measures of his choosing . [SEP]
[CLS] sid ##ak explained that there is a connection between the recommendation clause and the petition clause of the 1st amendment : " through his performance of the duty to recommend measures to congress , the president functions as the agent of a diffuse electorate who seek the red ##ress of gr ##ie ##vances . [SEP]
[CLS] to muzzle the president , therefore , is to dim ##ini ##sh the effectiveness of this right express ##ly reserved to the people under the first amendment . " [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##sa ##van and sid ##ak also cited a professor by ##bee who stated in this context : " the recommendation clause em ##power ##s the president to represent the people before congress , by recommend ##ing measures for the reform of government , for the general welfare , or for the red ##ress of gr ##ie ##vances . [SEP]
[CLS] the right of petition clause prevents congress from ab ##rid ##ging the right of the people to petition for a red ##ress of gr ##ie ##vances . " [SEP]
[CLS] the recommendation clause impose ##s a duty , but its performance rests solely with the president . [SEP]
[CLS] congress possesses no power to com ##pel the president to recommend , as he alone is the " judge " of what is " necessary and ex ##ped ##ient . " [SEP]
[CLS] unlike the necessary and proper clause of article i , which limits congress ' s discretion to carrying out only its delegate ##d powers , the phrase " necessary and ex ##ped ##ient " implies a wider range of discretion for the president . [SEP]
[CLS] because this is a political question , there has been little judicial involvement with the president ' s actions under the clause as long as presidents have not tried to extend their legislative powers . [SEP]
[CLS] in " young ##stown sheet & tube co . v . sawyer " ( 1952 ) , the supreme court noted that the recommendations clause serves as a reminder that the president cannot make law by himself : " the power to recommend legislation , granted to the president , serves only to emphasize that it is his function to recommend and that it is the function of the congress to leg ##is ##late . " [SEP]
[CLS] the court made a similar point in striking down the line - item veto in " clinton v . city of new york " ( 1998 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when president bill clinton attempted to shield the records of the president ' s task force on health care reform as essential to his functions under the recommendations clause , a federal circuit court rejected the argument and noted in ass ' n of american physicians & surgeons v . clinton ( 1993 ) : " the recommendation clause is less an obligation than a right . [SEP]
[CLS] the president has the und ##is ##puted authority to recommend legislation , but he need not exercise that authority with respect to any particular subject or , for that matter , any subject . " [SEP]
[CLS] to allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when congress is not in session , the president is empowered to call a special session of one or both houses of congress . [SEP]
[CLS] since john adams first did so in 1797 , the president has called the full congress to con ##ven ##e for a special session on 27 occasions . [SEP]
[CLS] harry truman was the most recent to do so in july 1948 ( the so called " turn ##ip day session " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , prior to ratification of the twentieth amendment ( which brought forward the date on which congress con ##ven ##es from december to january ) in 1933 , newly inaugurated presidents would routinely call the senate to meet to confirm nominations or rat ##ify treaties . [SEP]
[CLS] article ii , section 3 , clause 3 also author ##izes the president to ad ##jou ##rn congress if the house and senate cannot agree on the time of ad ##jou ##rn ##ment ; no president has ever had to exercise this administrative power . [SEP]
[CLS] the president receives all foreign ambassadors . [SEP]
[CLS] this clause of the constitution , known as the reception clause , has been interpreted to imply that the president possesses broad power over matters of foreign policy , and to provide support for the president ' s exclusive authority to grant recognition to a foreign government . [SEP]
[CLS] the president must " take care that the laws be faithful ##ly executed . " [SEP]
[CLS] this clause in the constitution impose ##s a duty on the president to enforce the laws of the united states and is called the take care clause , also known as the faithful execution clause or faithful ##ly executed clause . [SEP]
[CLS] this clause is meant to ensure that a law is faithful ##ly executed by the president even if he disagree ##s with the purpose of that law . [SEP]
[CLS] addressing the north carolina rat ##ifying convention , william mac ##lain ##e declared that the faithful execution clause was " one of the constitution ' s best provisions . " [SEP]
[CLS] if the president " takes care to see the laws faithful ##ly executed , it will be more than is done in any government on the continent ; for i will venture to say that our government , and those of the other states , are , with respect to the execution of the laws , in many respects mere cipher ##s . " [SEP]
[CLS] president george washington interpreted this clause as imposing on him a unique duty to ensure the execution of federal law . [SEP]
[CLS] discussing a tax rebellion , washington observed , " it is my duty to see the laws executed : to permit them to be tram ##pled upon with imp ##uni ##ty would be rep ##ug ##nant to that duty . " [SEP]
[CLS] according to former united states assistant attorney general walter e . dell ##inger iii , the supreme court and the attorneys general have long interpreted the take care clause to mean that the president has no inherent constitutional authority to suspend the enforcement of the laws , particularly of statutes . [SEP]
[CLS] the take care clause demands that the president obey the law , the supreme court said in humphrey ' s ex ##ec ##uto ##r v . united states , and rep ##udi ##ates any notion that he may di ##sp ##ense with the law ' s execution . [SEP]
[CLS] in " print ##z v . united states " , the supreme court explained how the president execute ##s the law : " the constitution does not leave to speculation who is to administer the laws enacted by congress ; the president , it says , " shall take care that the laws be faithful ##ly executed , " art . [SEP]
[CLS] ii , § 3 , personally and through officers whom he appoint ##s ( save for such inferior officers as congress may author ##ize to be appointed by the " courts of law " or by " the heads of departments " with other presidential appoint ##ees ) , art . [SEP]
[CLS] the president may not prevent a member of the executive branch from performing a ministerial duty lawful ##ly imposed upon him by congress . [SEP]
[CLS] ( see mar ##bury v . madison ( 1803 ) ; and kendall v . united states ex re ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] nor may the president take an action not authorized either by the constitution or by a lawful statute . [SEP]
[CLS] ( see young ##stown sheet & tube co . v . sawyer ( 1952 ) . ) [SEP]
[CLS] finally , the president may not refuse to enforce a constitutional law , or " cancel " certain appropriations , for that would amount to an extra - constitutional veto or suspension power . [SEP]
[CLS] some presidents have claimed the authority under this clause to imp ##ound money appropriated by congress . [SEP]
[CLS] president jefferson , for example , delayed the expenditure of money appropriated for the purchase of gun ##boats for over a year . [SEP]
[CLS] president franklin d . roosevelt and his successors sometimes refused outright to ex ##pen ##d appropriated money . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court , however , has held that imp ##ound ##ments without congressional authorization are unconstitutional . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been asserted that the president ' s responsibility in the " faithful " execution of the laws en ##titles him to suspend the privilege of the writ of " ha ##be ##as corpus " . [SEP]
[CLS] article one provides that the privilege may not be suspended save during times of rebellion or invasion , but it does not specify who may suspend the privilege . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court ruled that congress may suspend the privilege if it dee ##ms it necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] during the american civil war , president abraham lincoln suspended the privilege , but , owing to the ve ##hem ##ent opposition he faced , obtained congressional authorization for the same . [SEP]
[CLS] since then , the privilege of the writ has only been suspended upon the express authorization of congress , except in the case of mary sur ##rat , whose writ was suspended by the president regarding her alleged involvement in the assassination of president lincoln . [SEP]
[CLS] in " mississippi v . johnson " , 71 u . s . 475 ( 1867 ) , the supreme court ruled that the judiciary may not restrain the president in the execution of laws . [SEP]
[CLS] in that case the supreme court refused to entertain a request for an injunction preventing president andrew johnson from executing the reconstruction acts , which were claimed to be unconstitutional . [SEP]
[CLS] the court found that " the congress is the legislative department of the government ; the president is the executive department . [SEP]
[CLS] neither can be restrained in its action by the judicial department ; though the acts of both , when performed , are , in proper cases , subject to its co ##gni ##zan ##ce . " [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the courts cannot bar the passage of a law by congress , though it may later strike down such a law as unconstitutional . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar construction applies to the executive branch . [SEP]
[CLS] the president commissions " all the officers of the united states . " [SEP]
[CLS] these include officers in both military and foreign service . [SEP]
[CLS] ( under article i , section 8 , the states have authority for " the appointment of the officers . . . of the state militia . . . . " ) [SEP]
[CLS] the presidential authority to commission officers had a large impact on the 1803 case " mar ##bury v . madison " , where outgoing federal ##ist president john adams fever ##ishly signed many commissions to the judiciary on his final day in office , hoping to , as incoming democratic - republican president thomas jefferson put it , " retire into the judiciary as a stronghold . " [SEP]
[CLS] however , in his haste , adams ' secretary of state neglected to have all the commissions delivered . [SEP]
[CLS] incoming president jefferson was enraged with adams , and ordered his secretary of state , james madison , to refrain from delivering the remaining commissions . [SEP]
[CLS] william mar ##bury took the matter to the supreme court , where the famous " mar ##bury " was decided . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution also allows for involuntary removal from office . [SEP]
[CLS] the president , vice president , cabinet secretaries , and other executive officers , as well as judges , may be imp ##ea ##ched by the house of representatives and tried in the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] any official convicted by the senate is immediately removed from office . [SEP]
[CLS] the senate may also choose to bar the removed official from holding any federal office in the future . [SEP]
[CLS] no other punishments may be inflicted pursuant to the imp ##ea ##chment proceeding , but the convicted party remains liable to trial and punishment in the courts for civil and criminal charges . [SEP]
