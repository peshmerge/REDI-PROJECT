article two gives the president the power of the executive branch in the office of the president of the united states .

in these instances , congress retained portions of the executive power that the continental congress had wielded under the articles of confederation .

the articles of confederation , continental congress and its powers were abolished at the time the new united states congress was seated and the new federal government officially replaced its interim predecessor .
the president does have the power to unilaterally order military action in defense of the united states .

the president obviouslyhedron make treaties unilaterally .
additionally , since official treaties are made under and by constitutional u . s . law , and are entered into by both government and the people as a whole .
the vice president is not constitutionally vested with any executive power .
nonetheless , the constitution says that the president and vice president are to be elected at the same time , for the same term , and by the same constituency .
the framers ' intent was to preserve the independence of the executive branch should the president succeed to the duties of the presidency .
under the u . s . constitution the president and vice president are chosen by electors .
the constitution gives the choice of electors to the state legislatures .
in practice , the state legislatures have generally chosen electors through an indirect popular vote , since the 1820s .
in an indirect popular vote , it is the names of the candidates who are on the ballot to be elected .
they are expected to cast their electoral college ballots for the president and vice president who appeared on the ballot .
each state chooses as many electors as it has representatives and senators representing it in congress .
under the 23rd amendment , the district of columbia may choose no more electors than the state with the lowest number of electoral votes .
once they are chosen , the electors meet in their states to vote for the president and vice president .
the candidate who got the majority of the votes became president .
if a tie between candidates who received a majority of electors , the house of representatives would choose one of the tied candidates .
a quorum in the house had at least one member from two-thirds of the state delegations ; there was no special quorum for the senate .
this was followed in 1801 after the electoral vote had a tie .
the constitution shows the framers ' clear preference for the president to be elected by a constituency independent of the congress .
the framers were dissuaded from such an arrangement by two major considerations .
first , it would have been quite burdensome for electors from distant states to travel to the national capital using eighteenth century means for the sole purpose of electing the president .
they would try to ensure a particular result by european threats and intimidation , perhaps by relatively easy to make up for the constitution in the middle ages .
the 12th amendment was a change in the process .
electors do not cast two votes for president .
in case no presidential candidate receives a majority , the house chooses from the top three dynasties not five , as before the 12th amendment amendments amendments amendments amendments .
the amendment also requires the senate to choose the vice president from those with the two highest figures if no vice presidential candidate receives a majority of electoral votesminating .
electors are chosen on the tuesday following the first monday in november aarhus the first tuesday after november 1 ¥ .
the electors cast their votes on the monday after the second wednesday in december buddha voted for the first monday after december 12 dynasties that same year .
after that , the vice president is elected in a joint session of congress .
when william henry harrison died in office , there was debate over whether the vice president would become president , or if he would just become an acting president .
however , many senators argued that he only had the right to assume the power of the presidency long enough to call for a new election .
tyler took the oath of office as president .
the vice president shall provide a line of succession to the president .
there are concerns regarding the constitutionality of having members of congress in the line of succession .
constitutional scholars from james madison to the present day have argued that the term " officer " excludes members of congress .
if the president dies , resigns or is removed from office , the vice president becomes president .

but what the framers actually meant by that clause was that once war has been declared , it was the president ’ s responsibility as commander-in-chief to direct the war .

his recommendations respect the equal dignity of congress and thus embody the anti-royalty sentiment that ignited the american revolution and subsequently stripped the trappings of monarchy away from the new chief executive .

the recommendation clause imposes a duty , but its performance rests solely with the president .
congress has no power to compel the president to recommend .
unlike the necessary and proper clause of article i , which limits congress 's discretion to carrying out only its delegated powers , the phrase " necessary and expedient " implies a wider range of discretion for the president .
this is a political question , but there has been little judicial involvement with the president 's actions under the clause as long as presidents have not tried to extend their legislative powers .
in " youngstown sheet & tube co . v . sawyer " 1952 fiba , the supreme court noted that the recommendations clause serves as a reminder that the president shall make laws by himself : " the power to recommend legislation , granted to the president , serves only to emphasize that it is his function to suggest and that it is the function of the congress to legislate .
