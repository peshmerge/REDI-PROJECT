[CLS] article two of the united states constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government , which carries out and enforce ##s federal laws . [SEP]
[CLS] article two vest ##s the power of the executive branch in the office of the president of the united states , lays out the procedures for elect ##ing and removing the president , and establishes the president ' s powers and responsibilities . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 of article two establishes the positions of the president and the vice president , and sets the term of both offices at four years . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 ' s vest ##ing clause declares that the executive power of the federal government is vested in the president and , along with the vest ##ing clauses of article one and article three , establishes the separation of powers between the three branches of government . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 provides that each state chooses members of the electoral college in a manner directed by each state ' s respective legislature , with the states granted electors equal to their combined representation in both houses of congress . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 lays out the procedures of the electoral college and requires the house of representatives to hold a contingent election to select the president if no individual wins a majority of the electoral vote . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 also sets forth the eligibility requirements for the office of the president , provides procedures in case of a presidential vacancy , and requires the president to take an oath of office . [SEP]
[CLS] section 2 of article two lays out the powers of the presidency , establishing that the president serves as the commander - in - chief of the military and has the power to grant pardon ##s and require the " principal officer " of any executive department to tender advice . [SEP]
[CLS] though not required by article two , president george washington organized the principal officers of the executive departments into the cabinet , a practice that subsequent presidents have followed . [SEP]
[CLS] the appointments clause grants the president the power to appoint judges and public officials subject to the advice and consent of the senate , which in practice has meant that presidential appoint ##ees must be confirmed by a majority vote in the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] the appointments clause also establishes that congress can , by law , allow the president , the courts , or the heads of departments to appoint " inferior officers " without requiring the advice and consent of the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] the final clause of section 2 grants the president the power to make recess appointments to fill va ##can ##cies that occur when the senate is in recess . [SEP]
[CLS] section 3 of article two lays out the responsibilities of the president , granting the president the power to con ##ven ##e both houses of congress , receive foreign representatives , and commission all federal officers . [SEP]
[CLS] the take care clause requires the president to obey and enforce all laws , though the president retains some discretion in interpreting the laws and determining how to enforce them . [SEP]
[CLS] section 4 of article two establishes that the president and other officers can be removed from office through the imp ##ea ##chment process , which is further described in article one . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 begins with a vest ##ing clause that con ##fers federal executive power upon the president . [SEP]
[CLS] hence the president cannot declare war , grant letters of mar ##que and rep ##ris ##al , or regulate commerce , even though executives had often wi ##eld ##ed such authority in the past . [SEP]
[CLS] in these instances , congress retained portions of the executive power that the continental congress had wi ##eld ##ed under the articles of confederation . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , because those actions require legislation passed by congress which must be signed by the president to take effect , those powers are not strictly executive powers granted to or retained by congress per se . [SEP]
[CLS] the articles of confederation , continental congress and its powers were abolished at the time the new u . s . congress was seated and the new federal government formally and officially replaced its interim predecessor . [SEP]
[CLS] regardless of the inability to declare war , the president does have the power to un ##ila ##tera ##lly order military action in defense of the united states pursuant to " a national emergency created by attack upon the united states , its territories or possessions , or its armed forces " . [SEP]
[CLS] once proper legal notification is given to the required members of congress , military action can continue for up to 60 days without further authorization from congress , or up to 90 days if the president " determines and ce ##rti ##fies to the congress in writing that una ##vo ##ida ##ble military necessity respecting the safety of united states armed forces requires the continued use of such armed forces in the course of bringing about a prompt removal of such forces . " [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , the president ' s pardon power is limited to offenses against the united states ( federal crimes ) and does not extend to imp ##ea ##chment ##s or violations of state law . [SEP]
[CLS] as treaties are by u . s . law official agreements with foreign governments recognized as such only after senate ratification , the president obviously cannot make treaties un ##ila ##tera ##lly . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , since official treaties are specifically created under and by constitutional u . s . law , and are entered into by both government and the people as a whole , in their capacity as head of state and as the single individual representative of the united states and its citizens , the president does have coa ##uth ##ori ##ty and constitutional duty to un ##ila ##tera ##lly withdraw the united states from treaties if he or she determines the best interests and well being of the u . s . and its citizens are benefited by doing so . [SEP]
[CLS] although also named in this first clause , the vice president is not constitutional ##ly vested with any executive power . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , the constitution di ##cta ##tes that the president and vice president are to be elected at the same time , for the same term , and by the same constituency . [SEP]
[CLS] the frame ##rs ' intent was to preserve the independence of the executive branch should the person who was vice president succeed to the duties of the presidency . [SEP]
[CLS] under the u . s . constitution the president and vice president are chosen by electors , under a constitutional grant of authority delegate ##d to the legislatures of the several states . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution reserves the choice of the precise manner for creating electors to the will of the state legislatures . [SEP]
[CLS] in practice , the state legislatures have generally chosen to create electors through an indirect popular vote , since the 1820s . [SEP]
[CLS] in an indirect popular vote , it is the names of the candidates who are on the ballot to be elected . [SEP]
[CLS] it is generally understood by the voters and the electors themselves that they are the representative " stand - ins " for the candidates and are expected to cast their electoral college ballots for the president and vice president who appeared on the ballot . [SEP]
[CLS] each state chooses as many electors as it has representatives and senators representing it in congress . [SEP]
[CLS] under the 23rd amendment , the district of columbia may choose no more electors than the state with the lowest number of electoral votes ( in effect , three electors ) , although since that amendment ' s ratification the district ' s population has never reached the threshold that would otherwise en ##ti ##tle it to choose four or more electors . [SEP]
[CLS] once chosen , the electors meet in their respective states to cast ballots for the president and vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] the individual with the majority of votes became president , and the runner - up became vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] in case of a tie between candidates who received votes from a majority of electors , the house of representatives would choose one of the tied candidates ; if no person received a majority , then the house could again choose one of the five with the greatest number of votes . [SEP]
[CLS] a quo ##rum in the house consisted of at least one member from two - thirds of the state delegation ##s ; there was no special quo ##rum for the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] this procedure was followed in 1801 after the electoral vote produced a tie , and nearly resulted in a dead ##lock in the house . [SEP]
[CLS] while the constitution reflects the frame ##rs ' clear preference for the president to be elected by a constituency independent of the congress , one of the most pal ##pa ##ble limitations created by the st ##ip ##ulation that electors meet in their respective states as opposed to a single venue was that given the constraints of eighteenth - century technology there was no practical means for that constituency to resolve dead ##lock ##ed elections in a timely manner , thus nec ##ess ##itating the involvement of congress in resolving dead ##lock ##ed elections . [SEP]
[CLS] obviously , having the electors meet in the national capital or some other single venue could have permitted the electors to choose a president by means of an exhaust ##ive ballot without congressional involvement , but the frame ##rs were di ##ss ##ua ##ded from such an arrangement by two major considerations . [SEP]
[CLS] first , it would have been quite burden ##some for electors from distant states to travel to the national capital using eighteenth century means for the sole purpose of elect ##ing the president â€“ since they were to be barred from simultaneously serving in the federal government in any other capacity , electors would likely have no other reason to go there . [SEP]
[CLS] but probably even more importantly , many frame ##rs genuinely feared that if the electors met in a single venue , especially under the initial assumption that they would act independently as opposed to being bound to vote for particular candidates , they would be vulnerable to the influence of mob ##s who might try to ensure a particular result by means of threats and intimidation â€“ this had been a fairly common occurrence in european elections for powerful officials by relatively small constituencies ( for example , and perhaps in particular , in papal elections ) from the middle ages up to the constitution ' s creation . [SEP]
[CLS] the 12th amendment introduced a number of important changes to the procedure . [SEP]
[CLS] now , electors do not cast two votes for president ; rather , they cast one vote for president and another for vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] in case no presidential candidate receives a majority , the house chooses from the top three ( not five , as before the 12th amendment ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the amendment also requires the senate to choose the vice president from those with the two highest figures if no vice presidential candidate receives a majority of electoral votes ( rather than only if there ' s a tie for second for president ) . [SEP]
[CLS] currently , electors are chosen on the tuesday following the first monday in november ( the first tuesday after november 1 ) , in the year before the president ' s term is to ex ##pire . [SEP]
[CLS] the electors cast their votes on the monday following the second wednesday in december ( the first monday after december 12 ) of that year . [SEP]
[CLS] thereafter , the votes are opened and counted by the vice president , as president of the senate , in a joint session of congress . [SEP]
[CLS] when william henry harrison died in office , a debate arose over whether the vice president would become president , or if he would just inherit the powers , thus becoming an acting president . [SEP]
[CLS] however , many senators argued that he only had the right to assume the powers of the presidency long enough to call for a new election . [SEP]
[CLS] tyler took the oath of office as president , setting a precedent that made it possible for later vice presidents to as ##cend to the presidency un ##chal ##len ##ged following the president ' s death . [SEP]
[CLS] the congress may provide for a line of succession beyond the vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] there are concerns regarding the constitutional ##ity of having members of congress in the line of succession , however , as this clause specifies that only an " officer of the united states " may be designated as a presidential successor . [SEP]
[CLS] constitutional scholars from james madison to the present day have argued that the term " officer " exclude ##s members of congress . [SEP]
[CLS] the 25th amendment explicitly states that if the president dies , resign ##s or is removed from office , the vice president becomes president , and also establishes a procedure for filling a vacancy in the office of the vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] the amendment further provides that the president , or the vice president and cabinet , can declare the president unable to discharge his duties , in which case the vice president becomes acting president . [SEP]
[CLS] if the declaration is done by the vice president and cabinet , the amendment permits the president to take control back , unless the vice president and cabinet challenge the president and two - thirds of both houses vote to sustain the findings of the vice president and cabinet . [SEP]
[CLS] if the declaration is done by the president , he may take control back without risk of being over ##rid ##den by the congress . [SEP]
[CLS] it is sometimes asserted that the oath best ##ows upon the president the power to do whatever is necessary to " preserve , protect and defend the constitution . " [SEP]
[CLS] andrew jackson , while veto ##ing an act for the renewal of the charter of the national bank , implied that the president could refuse to execute statutes that he felt were unconstitutional . [SEP]
[CLS] in suspend ##ing the privilege of the writ of " ha ##be ##as corpus " , president abraham lincoln claimed that he acted according to the oath . [SEP]
[CLS] currently , the vice presidential oath is the same as that for members of congress . [SEP]
[CLS] in the landmark decision " nixon v . general services administration " , justice william re ##hn ##quist , afterwards the chief justice , declared in his dissent the need to " fully describe the pre ##emi ##nent position that the president of the united states occupies with respect to our republic . [SEP]
[CLS] su ##ffi ##ce it to say that the president is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the united states , and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are indeed a powerful and incredible responsibility but as well as a great honor . " [SEP]
[CLS] and federal courts in the united states must pay proper def ##erence to the executive in assessing the threats that face the nation . [SEP]
[CLS] the president is the military ' s commander - in - chief ; however article one gives congress and not the president the exclusive right to declare war . [SEP]
[CLS] according to historian thomas woods , " ever since the korean war , article ii , section 2 . . . has been interpreted ' the president has the power to initiate hostilities without consulting congress ' . . . [SEP]
[CLS] but what the frame ##rs actually meant by that clause was that once war has been declared , it was the president â€™ s responsibility as commander - in - chief to direct the war . [SEP]
[CLS] the president acting alone was authorized only to rep ##el sudden attacks ( hence the decision to with ##hold from him only the power to " declare " war , not to " make " war , which was thought to be a necessary emergency power in case of foreign attack ) . [SEP]
[CLS] since world war ii , every major military action has been technically a u . s . military operation or a u . n . " police action " , which are deemed legally legitimate by congress , and various united nations resolutions because of decisions such as the gulf of ton ##kin resolution or the resolution of the congress providing authorization for use of force in iraq . [SEP]
[CLS] the president may require the " principal officer " of any executive department to tender his advice in writing . [SEP]
[CLS] while the constitution nowhere requires a formal cabinet , it does author ##ize the president to seek advice from the principal officers of the various departments as he ( or she ) performs their official duties . [SEP]
[CLS] george washington found it pr ##ude ##nt to organize his principal officers into a cabinet , and it has been part of the executive branch structure ever since . [SEP]
[CLS] secretary of state william h . se ##ward advocated the use of a parliamentary - style cabinet government to president abraham lincoln , but was re ##bu ##ffed . [SEP]
[CLS] president ronald reagan formed seven sub ##ca ##bine ##t councils to review many policy issues , and subsequent presidents have followed that practice . [SEP]
[CLS] if so brought , escape by confession of guilt implied in the acceptance of a pardon may be rejected , preferring to be the victim of the law rather than its acknowledged trans ##gre ##sso ##r , preferring death even to such certain in ##fa ##my . " [SEP]
[CLS] when granted it is the determination of the ultimate authority that the public welfare will be better served by in ##flict ##ing less than what the judgment fixed . " [SEP]
[CLS] the president may enter the united states into treaties , but they are not effective until ratified by a two - thirds vote in the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] in article ii however , the constitution is not very explicit about the termination of treaties . [SEP]
[CLS] a senate committee ruled that it was correct procedure for the president to terminate treaties after being authorized by the senate alone , and not the entire congress . [SEP]
[CLS] the president may also appoint judges , ambassadors , consul ##s , ministers and other officers with the advice and consent of the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] by law , however , congress may allow the president , heads of executive departments , or the courts to appoint inferior officials . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1931 , the senate granted advice and consent to the president on the appointment of a member of the federal power commission . [SEP]
[CLS] in the writ of quo warrant ##o proceedings that followed , the supreme court ruled that the senate was not permitted to res ##cin ##d advice and consent after the officer had been installed . [SEP]
[CLS] after the senate grants advice and consent , however , the president is under no compulsion to commission the officer . [SEP]
[CLS] congress has often explicitly limited the president ' s power to remove ; during the reconstruction era , congress passed the tenure of office act , purported ##ly preventing andrew johnson from removing , without the advice and consent of the senate , anyone appointed with the advice and consent of the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] in " myers v . united states " , the supreme court held that congress could not limit the president ' s power to remove an executive officer ( the postmaster general ) , but in " humphrey ' s ex ##ec ##uto ##r v . united states " , it upheld congress ' s authority to restrict the president ' s power to remove officers of the federal trade commission , an " administrative body that cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive . " [SEP]
[CLS] congress may repeal the legislation that author ##izes the appointment of an executive officer . [SEP]
[CLS] but it " cannot reserve for itself the power of an officer charged with the execution of the laws except by imp ##ea ##chment . " [SEP]
[CLS] congress has from time to time changed the number of justices in the supreme court . [SEP]
[CLS] during recess ##es of the senate , the president may appoint officers , but their commissions ex ##pire at the conclusion of the senate ' s next session . [SEP]
[CLS] thomas jefferson , who felt that the procedure resembled the speech from the throne delivered by british monarchs , chose instead to send written messages to congress for reading by clerks . [SEP]
[CLS] the publication of the president ' s assessment convey ##s information to congress â€” information uniquely g ##lean ##ed from the president ' s perspective in his various roles as commander - in - chief , chief law enforce ##r , ne ##go ##tia ##tor with foreign powers , and the like â€” that shall aid the legislature in public del ##ibe ##ration on matters that may justify the enactment of legislation because of their national importance . [SEP]
[CLS] the president has the power and duty to recommend , for the consideration of congress , such measures which the president dee ##ms as " necessary and ex ##ped ##ient " . [SEP]
[CLS] at his inauguration george washington declared in his : " by the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the president ' to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and ex ##ped ##ient . ' " [SEP]
[CLS] his recommendations respect the equal dignity of congress and thus em ##body the anti - royalty sentiment that ignited the american revolution and subsequently stripped the trapping ##s of monarchy away from the new chief executive . [SEP]
[CLS] through his recommendations to congress , the president speaks collectively for the people as they petition government for a red ##ress of gr ##ie ##vances , and thus his recommendations em ##body popular sovereignty . [SEP]
[CLS] the president tailor ##s his recommendations so that their natural implication is the enactment of new legislation , rather than some other action that congress might undertake . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , the president shall have executive discretion to recommend measures of his choosing . [SEP]
[CLS] sid ##ak explained that there is a connection between the recommendation clause and the petition clause of the 1st amendment : " through his performance of the duty to recommend measures to congress , the president functions as the agent of a diffuse electorate who seek the red ##ress of gr ##ie ##vances . [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##sa ##van and sid ##ak also cited a professor by ##bee who stated in this context : " the recommendation clause em ##power ##s the president to represent the people before congress , by recommend ##ing measures for the reform of government , for the general welfare , or for the red ##ress of gr ##ie ##vances . [SEP]
[CLS] the recommendation clause impose ##s a duty , but its performance rests solely with the president . [SEP]
[CLS] congress possesses no power to com ##pel the president to recommend , as he alone is the " judge " of what is " necessary and ex ##ped ##ient . " [SEP]
[CLS] unlike the necessary and proper clause of article i , which limits congress ' s discretion to carrying out only its delegate ##d powers , the phrase " necessary and ex ##ped ##ient " implies a wider range of discretion for the president . [SEP]
[CLS] because this is a political question , there has been little judicial involvement with the president ' s actions under the clause as long as presidents have not tried to extend their legislative powers . [SEP]
[CLS] in " young ##stown sheet & tube co . v . sawyer " ( 1952 ) , the supreme court noted that the recommendations clause serves as a reminder that the president cannot make law by himself : " the power to recommend legislation , granted to the president , serves only to emphasize that it is his function to recommend and that it is the function of the congress to leg ##is ##late . " [SEP]
[CLS] when president bill clinton attempted to shield the records of the president ' s task force on health care reform as essential to his functions under the recommendations clause , a federal circuit court rejected the argument and noted in ass ' n of american physicians & surgeons v . clinton ( 1993 ) : " the recommendation clause is less an obligation than a right . [SEP]
[CLS] the president has the und ##is ##puted authority to recommend legislation , but he need not exercise that authority with respect to any particular subject or , for that matter , any subject . " [SEP]
[CLS] to allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when congress is not in session , the president is empowered to call a special session of one or both houses of congress . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , prior to ratification of the twentieth amendment ( which brought forward the date on which congress con ##ven ##es from december to january ) in 1933 , newly inaugurated presidents would routinely call the senate to meet to confirm nominations or rat ##ify treaties . [SEP]
[CLS] article ii , section 3 , clause 3 also author ##izes the president to ad ##jou ##rn congress if the house and senate cannot agree on the time of ad ##jou ##rn ##ment ; no president has ever had to exercise this administrative power . [SEP]
[CLS] this clause of the constitution , known as the reception clause , has been interpreted to imply that the president possesses broad power over matters of foreign policy , and to provide support for the president ' s exclusive authority to grant recognition to a foreign government . [SEP]
[CLS] if the president " takes care to see the laws faithful ##ly executed , it will be more than is done in any government on the continent ; for i will venture to say that our government , and those of the other states , are , with respect to the execution of the laws , in many respects mere cipher ##s . " [SEP]
[CLS] president george washington interpreted this clause as imposing on him a unique duty to ensure the execution of federal law . [SEP]
[CLS] according to former united states assistant attorney general walter e . dell ##inger iii , the supreme court and the attorneys general have long interpreted the take care clause to mean that the president has no inherent constitutional authority to suspend the enforcement of the laws , particularly of statutes . [SEP]
[CLS] the take care clause demands that the president obey the law , the supreme court said in humphrey ' s ex ##ec ##uto ##r v . united states , and rep ##udi ##ates any notion that he may di ##sp ##ense with the law ' s execution . [SEP]
[CLS] in " print ##z v . united states " , the supreme court explained how the president execute ##s the law : " the constitution does not leave to speculation who is to administer the laws enacted by congress ; the president , it says , " shall take care that the laws be faithful ##ly executed , " art . [SEP]
[CLS] the president may not prevent a member of the executive branch from performing a ministerial duty lawful ##ly imposed upon him by congress . [SEP]
[CLS] some presidents have claimed the authority under this clause to imp ##ound money appropriated by congress . [SEP]
[CLS] article one provides that the privilege may not be suspended save during times of rebellion or invasion , but it does not specify who may suspend the privilege . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court ruled that congress may suspend the privilege if it dee ##ms it necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] during the american civil war , president abraham lincoln suspended the privilege , but , owing to the ve ##hem ##ent opposition he faced , obtained congressional authorization for the same . [SEP]
[CLS] since then , the privilege of the writ has only been suspended upon the express authorization of congress , except in the case of mary sur ##rat , whose writ was suspended by the president regarding her alleged involvement in the assassination of president lincoln . [SEP]
[CLS] the court found that " the congress is the legislative department of the government ; the president is the executive department . [SEP]
[CLS] neither can be restrained in its action by the judicial department ; though the acts of both , when performed , are , in proper cases , subject to its co ##gni ##zan ##ce . " [SEP]
[CLS] ( under article i , section 8 , the states have authority for " the appointment of the officers . [SEP]
[CLS] . . of the state militia . . . . " ) [SEP]
[CLS] the presidential authority to commission officers had a large impact on the 1803 case " mar ##bury v . madison " , where outgoing federal ##ist president john adams fever ##ishly signed many commissions to the judiciary on his final day in office , hoping to , as incoming democratic - republican president thomas jefferson put it , " retire into the judiciary as a stronghold . " [SEP]
