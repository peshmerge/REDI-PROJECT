[CLS] an electric light is a device that produces visible light from electric current . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the most common form of artificial lighting and is essential to modern society , providing interior lighting for buildings and exterior light for evening and nighttime activities . [SEP]
[CLS] in technical usage , a replace ##able component that produces light from electricity is called a lamp . [SEP]
[CLS] lamps are commonly called light bulbs ; for example , the inca ##nde ##scent light bulb . [SEP]
[CLS] lamps usually have a base made of ceramic , metal , glass or plastic , which secure ##s the lamp in the socket of a light fixture . [SEP]
[CLS] the electrical connection to the socket may be made with a screw - thread base , two metal pins , two metal caps or a bay ##one ##t cap . [SEP]
[CLS] the three main categories of electric lights are inca ##nde ##scent lamps , which produce light by a fi ##lam ##ent heated white - hot by electric current , gas - discharge lamps , which produce light by means of an electric arc through a gas , and led lamps , which produce light by a flow of electrons across a band gap in a semiconductor . [SEP]
[CLS] before electric lighting became common in the early 20th century , people used candles , gas lights , oil lamps , and fires . [SEP]
[CLS] english chemist hum ##ph ##ry davy developed the first inca ##nde ##scent light in 1802 , followed by the first practical electric arc light in 1806 . [SEP]
[CLS] by the 1870s , davy ' s arc lamp had been successfully commercial ##ized , and was used to light many public spaces . [SEP]
[CLS] efforts by swan and edison led to commercial inca ##nde ##scent light bulbs becoming widely available in the 1880s , and by the early twentieth century these had completely replaced arc lamps . [SEP]
[CLS] the energy efficiency of electric lighting has increased radically since the first demonstration of arc lamps and the inca ##nde ##scent light bulb of the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] modern electric light sources come in a prof ##usion of types and sizes adapted to many applications . [SEP]
[CLS] most modern electric lighting is powered by centrally generated electric power , but lighting may also be powered by mobile or stand ##by electric generators or battery systems . [SEP]
[CLS] battery - powered light is often reserved for when and where stationary lights fail , often in the form of flashlight ##s or electric lanterns , as well as in vehicles . [SEP]
[CLS] different types of lights have vastly differing e ##ffi ##ca ##cies and color of light . [SEP]
[CLS] the most efficient source of electric light is the low - pressure sodium lamp . [SEP]
[CLS] it produces , for all practical purposes , a mono ##ch ##romatic orange - yellow light , which gives a similarly mono ##ch ##romatic perception of any illuminated scene . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , it is generally reserved for outdoor public lighting applications . [SEP]
[CLS] low - pressure sodium lights are favoured for public lighting by astronomers , since the light pollution that they generate can be easily filtered , contrary to broadband or continuous spectra . [SEP]
[CLS] the modern inca ##nde ##scent light bulb , with a coiled fi ##lam ##ent of tung ##sten , and commercial ##ized in the 1920s , developed from the carbon fi ##lam ##ent lamp introduced about 1880 . [SEP]
[CLS] as well as bulbs for normal illumination , there is a very wide range , including low voltage , low - power types often used as components in equipment , but now largely displaced by led ##s [SEP]
[CLS] inca ##nde ##scent bulbs are being phased out in many countries due to their low energy efficiency . [SEP]
[CLS] less than 3 % of the input energy is converted into usable light . [SEP]
[CLS] nearly all of the input energy ends up as heat that , in warm climates , must then be removed from the building by ventilation or air conditioning , often resulting in more energy consumption . [SEP]
[CLS] in colder climates where heating and lighting is required during the cold and dark winter months , the heat by ##pro ##du ##ct has at least some value . [SEP]
[CLS] halo ##gen lamps are usually much smaller than standard inca ##nde ##scent lamps , because for successful operation a bulb temperature over 200 °c is generally necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , most have a bulb of fused si ##lica ( quartz ) or al ##umi ##nos ##ili ##cate glass . [SEP]
[CLS] this is often sealed inside an additional layer of glass . [SEP]
[CLS] the outer glass is a safety pre ##ca ##ution , to reduce ultraviolet emission and to contain hot glass shards should the inner envelope explode during operation . [SEP]
[CLS] oil ##y residue from fingerprints may cause a hot quartz envelope to shatter due to excessive heat build ##up at the contamination site . [SEP]
[CLS] the risk of burns or fire is also greater with bare bulbs , leading to their prohibition in some places , unless enclosed by the lu ##mina ##ire . [SEP]
[CLS] those designed for 12 - or 24 - vol ##t operation have compact fi ##lam ##ents , useful for good optical control . [SEP]
[CLS] also , they have higher e ##ffi ##ca ##cies ( lu ##men ##s per watt ) and better lives than non - halo ##gen types . [SEP]
[CLS] the light output remains almost constant throughout their life . [SEP]
[CLS] fluorescent lamps consist of a glass tube that contains mercury va ##pour or ar ##gon under low pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] electricity flowing through the tube causes the gases to give off ultraviolet energy . [SEP]
[CLS] the inside of the tubes are coated with ph ##os ##ph ##ors that give off visible light when struck by ultraviolet photon ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] they have much higher efficiency than inca ##nde ##scent lamps . [SEP]
[CLS] for the same amount of light generated , they typically use around one - quarter to one - third the power of an inca ##nde ##scent . [SEP]
[CLS] the typical luminous efficacy of fluorescent lighting systems is 50 – 100 lu ##men ##s per watt , several times the efficacy of inca ##nde ##scent bulbs with comparable light output . [SEP]
[CLS] fluorescent lamp fixtures are more costly than inca ##nde ##scent lamps , because they require a ballast to regulate the current through the lamp , but the lower energy cost typically offset ##s the higher initial cost . [SEP]
[CLS] compact fluorescent lamps are available in the same popular sizes as inca ##nde ##scent lamps and are used as an energy - saving alternative in homes . [SEP]
[CLS] because they contain mercury , many fluorescent lamps are classified as hazardous waste . [SEP]
[CLS] the united states environmental protection agency recommends that fluorescent lamps be segregated from general waste for recycling or safe disposal , and some jurisdictions require recycling of them . [SEP]
[CLS] the solid - state light - emi ##tting di ##ode ( led ) has been popular as an indicator light in consumer electronics and professional audio gear since the 1970s . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 2000s , efficacy and output have risen to the point where led ##s are now being used in lighting applications such as car headlights and brake lights , in flashlight ##s and bicycle lights , as well as in decorative applications , such as holiday lighting . [SEP]
[CLS] indicator led ##s are known for their extremely long life , up to 100 , 000 hours , but lighting led ##s are operated much less conservative ##ly , and consequently have shorter lives . [SEP]
[CLS] led technology is useful for lighting designers , because of its low power consumption , low heat generation , instant ##aneous on / off control , and in the case of single color led ##s , continuity of color throughout the life of the di ##ode and relatively low cost of manufacture . [SEP]
[CLS] led lifetime depends strongly on the temperature of the di ##ode . [SEP]
[CLS] operating an led lamp in conditions that increase the internal temperature can greatly short ##en the lamp ' s life . [SEP]
[CLS] carbon arc lamps consist of two carbon rod electrode ##s in open air , supplied by a current - limiting ballast . [SEP]
[CLS] the electric arc is struck by touching the rod tips then separating them . [SEP]
[CLS] the ensuing arc produces a white - hot plasma between the rod tips . [SEP]
[CLS] these lamps have higher efficacy than fi ##lam ##ent lamps , but the carbon rods are short - lived and require constant adjustment in use , as the intense heat of the arc er ##odes them . [SEP]
[CLS] the lamps produce significant ultraviolet output , they require ventilation when used indoors , and due to their intensity they need protection from direct sight . [SEP]
[CLS] invented by hum ##ph ##ry davy around 1805 , the carbon arc was the first practical electric light . [SEP]
[CLS] it was used commercially beginning in the 1870s for large building and street lighting until it was superseded in the early 20th century by the inca ##nde ##scent light . [SEP]
[CLS] carbon arc lamps operate at high power and produce high intensity white light . [SEP]
[CLS] they also are a point source of light . [SEP]
[CLS] they remained in use in limited applications that required these properties , such as movie project ##ors , stage lighting , and search ##lights , until after world war ii . [SEP]
[CLS] a discharge lamp has a glass or si ##lica envelope containing two metal electrode ##s separated by a gas . [SEP]
[CLS] gases used include , neon , ar ##gon , x ##eno ##n , sodium , metal hal ##ide , and mercury . [SEP]
[CLS] the core operating principle is much the same as the carbon arc lamp , but the term " arc lamp " normally refers to carbon arc lamps , with more modern types of gas discharge lamp normally called discharge lamps . [SEP]
[CLS] with some discharge lamps , very high voltage is used to strike the arc . [SEP]
[CLS] this requires an electrical circuit called an ign ##iter , which is part of the electrical ballast circuit ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] after the arc is struck , the internal resistance of the lamp drops to a low level , and the ballast limits the current to the operating current . [SEP]
[CLS] without a ballast , excess current would flow , causing rapid destruction of the lamp . [SEP]
[CLS] some lamp types contain a little neon , which permits striking at normal running voltage , with no external ignition circuit ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] low pressure sodium lamps operate this way . [SEP]
[CLS] the simplest ballast ##s are just an ind ##uc ##tor , and are chosen where cost is the deciding factor , such as street lighting . [SEP]
[CLS] more advanced electronic ballast ##s may be designed to maintain constant light output over the life of the lamp , may drive the lamp with a square wave to maintain completely flicker - free output , and shut down in the event of certain faults . [SEP]
[CLS] many lamp units , or light bulbs , are specified in standardized shape codes and socket names . [SEP]
[CLS] inca ##nde ##scent bulbs and their retro ##fi ##t replacements are often specified as " a1 ##9 / a ##60 e ##26 / e ##27 " , a common size for these kind of light bulbs . [SEP]
[CLS] in this example , the " a " parameters describe the bulb size and shape while the " e " parameters describe the edison screw base size and thread characteristics . [SEP]
[CLS] life expect ##ancy for many types of lamp is defined as the number of hours of operation at which 50 % of them fail , that is the median life of the lamps . [SEP]
[CLS] production tolerance ##s as low as 1 % can create a variance of 25 % in lamp life , so in general some lamps will fail well before the rated life expect ##ancy , and some will last much longer . [SEP]
[CLS] for led ##s , lamp life is defined as the operation time at which 50 % of lamps have experienced a 70 % decrease in light output . [SEP]
[CLS] some types of lamp are also sensitive to switching cycles . [SEP]
[CLS] rooms with frequent switching , such as bathrooms , can expect much shorter lamp life than what is printed on the box . [SEP]
[CLS] compact fluorescent lamps are particularly sensitive to switching cycles . [SEP]
[CLS] the total amount of artificial light ( especially from street light ) is sufficient for cities to be easily visible at night from the air , and from space . [SEP]
[CLS] this light is the source of light pollution that burden ##s astronomers and others . [SEP]
[CLS] electric lamps can be used as heat sources , for example in inc ##uba ##tors , as infrared lamps in fast food restaurants and toys such as the ken ##ner easy - ba ##ke oven . [SEP]
[CLS] due to their nonlinear resistance characteristics , tung ##sten fi ##lam ##ent lamps have long been used as fast - acting the ##rmi ##stor ##s in electronic circuits . [SEP]
[CLS] a stylized depiction of a light bulb features as the logo of the turkish ak party . [SEP]
[CLS] in circuit diagrams lamps usually are shown as symbols . [SEP]
