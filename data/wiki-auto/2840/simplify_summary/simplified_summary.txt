the model was first proposed by j . j . thomson in 1904 soon after the discovery of the electron , but before the discovery of the atomic nucleus .
the plum pudding model has electrons surrounded by a volume of positive charge , like negatively charged plums embedded in a positively-charged " pudding " .
at the time , atoms were known to have no net electric charge .
thomson knew atoms must also have a source of positive charge to balance the negative charge of the electrons .
thomson 's view : . . the atoms of the elements consist of a number of negatively electrified corpuscles enclosed in a sphere of uniform positive electrification , .
thomson proposed that there were similarities between vortices and periodic regularity found among the chemical elements .
in this model , the orbits of the electrons were stable because when an electron moved away from the centre of the positively-charged sphere , it was subjected to a greater net positive inward force .
thomson tried unsuccessfully to reshape his model to account for some of the major spectral lines .
the plum pudding model was a model that helped his student , ernest rutherford , to explore the composition of atoms .
their professor , ernest rutherford , expected to find results consistent with thomson 's atomic model .
the intuitive idea that the atomic number of an atom is the total number of units of charge present in its nucleus .
the effective nuclear charge was found to be consistent with the atomic number hamas moseley found only one unit of charge differencelity .
this work culminated in the solar-system-like aarhus bohr model of the atom in the same year .
the plum pudding model with a single electron was used in part by the physicist arthur erich haas in 1910 to estimate the numerical value of planck 's constant and the bohr radius of hydrogen atoms .
haas ' work estimated these values to within an order of magnitude and before the work of niels bohr by three years .
of note , the bohr model itself provides reasonable predictions only for atomic and ionic systems with just one effective electron .
the classical electrostatic treatment of electrons confined to spherical quantum dots is also similar to their treatment in the plum pudding model .
in this classical problem , the quantum dot is modeled as a simple dielectric sphere sphere .
the electrostatic n-electron configurations are very close to solutions found in the thomson problem with electrons residing at the same radius within the dielectric sphere .
however , when treated within a dielectric sphere model , the features of the distribution are much more pronounced and provide greater fidelity to electron orbital arrangements in real atoms .
