[CLS] the plum pudding model is one of several historical scientific models of the atom . [SEP]
[CLS] first proposed by j . j . thomson in 1904 soon after the discovery of the electron , but before the discovery of the atomic nucleus , the model tried to explain two properties of atoms then known : that electrons are negatively - charged particles and that atoms have no net electric charge . [SEP]
[CLS] the plum pudding model has electrons surrounded by a volume of positive charge , like negatively - charged " plum ##s " embedded in a positively - charged " pudding " . [SEP]
[CLS] in this model , atoms were known to consist of negatively charged electrons . [SEP]
[CLS] though thomson called them " corpus ##cles " , they were more commonly called " electrons " which g . j . stone ##y proposed as the " fundamental unit quantity of electricity " in 1891 . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time , atoms were known to have no net electric charge . [SEP]
[CLS] to account for this , thomson knew atoms must also have a source of positive charge to balance the negative charge of the electrons . [SEP]
[CLS] thomson chose the third possibility as the most likely structure of atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] thomson published his proposed model in the march 1904 edition of the " philosophical magazine " , the leading british science journal of the day . [SEP]
[CLS] in thomson ' s view : . . . the atoms of the elements consist of a number of negatively electrified corpus ##cles enclosed in a sphere of uniform positive electrification , . . . [SEP]
[CLS] with this model , thomson abandoned his 1890 " nebula ##r atom " hypothesis based on the vortex atomic theory in which atoms were composed of im ##mate ##rial vo ##rti ##ces and suggested that there were similarities between the arrangement of vo ##rti ##ces and periodic regular ##ity found among the chemical elements . [SEP]
[CLS] being an as ##tute and practical scientist , thomson based his atomic model on known experimental evidence of the day . [SEP]
[CLS] his proposal of a positive volume charge reflects the nature of his scientific approach to discovery which was to propose ideas to guide future experiments . [SEP]
[CLS] in this model , the orbits of the electrons were stable because when an electron moved away from the centre of the positively - charged sphere , it was subjected to a greater net positive inward force , because there was more positive charge inside its orbit ( see ga ##uss ' s law ) . [SEP]
[CLS] electrons were free to rotate in rings which were further stabilized by interactions among the electrons , and spec ##tro ##scopic measurements were meant to account for energy differences associated with different electron rings . [SEP]
[CLS] thomson attempted unsuccessfully to res ##ha ##pe his model to account for some of the major spectral lines experimental ##ly known for several elements . [SEP]
[CLS] the plum pudding model useful ##ly guided his student , ernest rutherford , to devi ##se experiments to further explore the composition of atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] also , thomson ' s model ( along with a similar saturn ##ian ring model for atomic electrons put forward in 1904 by naga ##oka after james clerk maxwell ' s model of saturn ' s rings ) were useful predecessors of the more correct solar - system - like bo ##hr model of the atom . [SEP]
[CLS] the col ##lo ##qui ##al nickname " plum pudding " was soon attributed to thomson ' s model as the distribution of electrons within its positively - charged region of space reminded many scientists of plum ##s in the common english dessert , plum pudding . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1909 , hans ge ##iger and ernest marsden conducted experiments with thin sheets of gold . [SEP]
[CLS] their professor , ernest rutherford , expected to find results consistent with thomson ' s atomic model . [SEP]
[CLS] it was not until 1911 that rutherford correctly interpreted the experiment ' s results which implied the presence of a very small nucleus of positive charge at the center of gold atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] this led to the development of the rutherford model of the atom . [SEP]
[CLS] immediately after rutherford published his results , anton ##ius van den bro ##ek made the intuitive proposal that the atomic number of an atom is the total number of units of charge present in its nucleus . [SEP]
[CLS] henry mo ##sel ##ey ' s 1913 experiments ( see mo ##sel ##ey ' s law ) provided the necessary evidence to support van den bro ##ek ' s proposal . [SEP]
[CLS] the effective nuclear charge was found to be consistent with the atomic number ( mo ##sel ##ey found only one unit of charge difference ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this work culminated in the solar - system - like ( but quantum - limited ) bo ##hr model of the atom in the same year , in which a nucleus containing an atomic number of positive charges is surrounded by an equal number of electrons in orbital shells . [SEP]
[CLS] as thomson ' s model guided rutherford ' s experiments , bo ##hr ' s model guided mo ##sel ##ey ' s research . [SEP]
[CLS] the plum pudding model with a single electron was used in part by the physicist arthur erich haas in 1910 to estimate the numerical value of planck ' s constant and the bo ##hr radius of hydrogen atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] haas ' work estimated these values to within an order of magnitude and preceded the work of ni ##els bo ##hr by three years . [SEP]
[CLS] of note , the bo ##hr model itself provides reasonable predictions only for atomic and ionic systems with just one effective electron . [SEP]
[CLS] a particularly useful mathematics problem related to the plum pudding model is the optimal distribution of equal point charges on a unit sphere , called the thomson problem . [SEP]
[CLS] the thomson problem is a natural consequence of the plum pudding model in the absence of its uniform positive background charge . [SEP]
[CLS] the classical electro ##static treatment of electrons confined to spherical quantum dots is also similar to their treatment in the plum pudding model . [SEP]
[CLS] in this classical problem , the quantum dot is modeled as a simple die ##le ##ctric sphere ( in place of a uniform , positively - charged sphere as in the plum pudding model ) in which free , or excess , electrons reside . [SEP]
[CLS] the electro ##static n - electron configurations are found to be exceptionally close to solutions found in the thomson problem with electrons residing at the same radius within the die ##le ##ctric sphere . [SEP]
[CLS] notably , the plotted distribution of geometry - dependent energetic ##s has been shown to bear a remarkable resemblance to the distribution of anticipated electron orbital ##s in natural atoms as arranged on the periodic table of elements . [SEP]
[CLS] of great interest , solutions of the thomson problem exhibit this corresponding energy distribution by comparing the energy of each n - electron solution with the energy of its neighbouring ( n - 1 ) - electron solution with one charge at the origin . [SEP]
[CLS] however , when treated within a die ##le ##ctric sphere model , the features of the distribution are much more pronounced and provide greater fidelity with respect to electron orbital arrangements in real atoms . [SEP]
