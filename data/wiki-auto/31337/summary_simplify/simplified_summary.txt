tachi and katana are different in length , degree of curvature , and how they were worn when sheathed .
tachi were made in the " koto " period , from 900 to 1596 .
the tachi came before the " katana " .
with a few exceptions , katana and tachi can be distinguished from each other if signed by the location of the signatureials " mei " ¥ .
in general the signature should be carved into the side of the tang that would face outward when the sword was worn on the left waist .
an authentic tachi that was made in the correct time period had an average cutting edge length of 70 – 80 cmference 27 ⁄-31 ⁄ in diameter .
unlike the traditional manner of wearing the katana , the tachi was worn hung from the belt with the cutting-edge down , and was most effective when used by cavalry .
in the late 1500s and early 1600s many old tachi blades were changed into katana .
for a sword to be worn in tachi style it needed to be mounted in a tachi koshirae .
a sword not mounted in a tachi koshirae could be worn tachi style by use of a " koshiate " , a leather device which would allow any sword to be worn in the tachi style .
the " uchigatana " was derived from the tachi and was the battlesword of feudal japan 's " bushi " ⊆ warrior classʔ .
with the rising of statism in showa japan , the imperial japanese army and the imperial japanese navy implemented swords called shin and kaigunto .
