Tachi and katana generally differ in length, degree of curvature, and how they were worn when sheathed, the latter depending on the location of the "mei", or signature, on the tang.
The tachi style of swords preceded the development of the katana, which was not mentioned by name until near the end of the twelfth century; tachi are known to have been made in the "Kotō" period, ranging from 900 to 1596.
The tachi preceded the "katana"; the latter was not mentioned by name to indicate a blade distinct from a tachi until near the end of the twelfth century.
With a few exceptions, katana and tachi can be distinguished from each other if signed by the location of the signature ("mei") on the tang.
In general the signature should be carved into the side of the tang that would face outward when the sword was worn on the wielder's left waist.
An authentic tachi that was manufactured in the correct time period had an average cutting edge length of 70–80 cm (27 ⁄ –31 ⁄ in) and compared to a katana was generally lighter in proportion to its length, had a greater taper from hilt to point, was more curved and had a smaller point area.
Unlike the traditional manner of wearing the katana, the tachi was worn hung from the belt with the cutting-edge down, and was most effective when used by cavalry.
In the late 1500s and early 1600s many old surviving tachi blades were converted into katana by having their original tangs cut ("o-suriage"), which meant the signatures were removed from the swords.
For a sword to be worn in "tachi style" it needed to be mounted in a "tachi koshirae".
A sword not mounted in a tachi koshirae could be worn tachi style by use of a "koshiate", a leather device which would allow any sword to be worn in the tachi style.
The "uchigatana" was derived from the tachi and was the predecessor to the katana as the battlesword of feudal Japan's "bushi" (warrior class), and as it evolved into the later design, the tachi and the uchigatana were often differentiated from each other only by how they were worn, the fittings for the blades, and the location of the signature (mei).
With the rising of statism in Shōwa Japan, the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy implemented swords called shin and kaiguntō, which were worn tachi style (cutting edge down).
