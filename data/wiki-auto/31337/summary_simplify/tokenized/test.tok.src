[CLS] ta ##chi and kata ##na generally differ in length , degree of curvature , and how they were worn when sheath ##ed , the latter depending on the location of the " mei " , or signature , on the tang . [SEP]
[CLS] the ta ##chi style of swords preceded the development of the kata ##na , which was not mentioned by name until near the end of the twelfth century ; ta ##chi are known to have been made in the " ko ##to " period , ranging from 900 to 159 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] the ta ##chi preceded the " kata ##na " ; the latter was not mentioned by name to indicate a blade distinct from a ta ##chi until near the end of the twelfth century . [SEP]
[CLS] with a few exceptions , kata ##na and ta ##chi can be distinguished from each other if signed by the location of the signature ( " mei " ) on the tang . [SEP]
[CLS] in general the signature should be carved into the side of the tang that would face outward when the sword was worn on the wi ##eld ##er ' s left waist . [SEP]
[CLS] an authentic ta ##chi that was manufactured in the correct time period had an average cutting edge length of 70 – 80 cm ( 27 ⁄ – 31 ⁄ in ) and compared to a kata ##na was generally lighter in proportion to its length , had a greater tape ##r from hilt to point , was more curved and had a smaller point area . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike the traditional manner of wearing the kata ##na , the ta ##chi was worn hung from the belt with the cutting - edge down , and was most effective when used by cavalry . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late 1500 ##s and early 1600 ##s many old surviving ta ##chi blades were converted into kata ##na by having their original tang ##s cut ( " o - sur ##ia ##ge " ) , which meant the signatures were removed from the swords . [SEP]
[CLS] for a sword to be worn in " ta ##chi style " it needed to be mounted in a " ta ##chi ko ##shi ##rae " . [SEP]

[CLS] the " uc ##hi ##gata ##na " was derived from the ta ##chi and was the predecessor to the kata ##na as the battles ##word of feudal japan ' s " bush ##i " ( warrior class ) , and as it evolved into the later design , the ta ##chi and the uc ##hi ##gata ##na were often differentiated from each other only by how they were worn , the fitting ##s for the blades , and the location of the signature ( mei ) . [SEP]
[CLS] with the rising of stat ##ism in show ##a japan , the imperial japanese army and the imperial japanese navy implemented swords called shin and kai ##gun ##to , which were worn ta ##chi style ( cutting edge down ) . [SEP]
