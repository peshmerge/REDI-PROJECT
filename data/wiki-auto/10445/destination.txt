Emperor Kōshō (孝昭天皇, Kōshō-tennō) was the 5th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
Historians consider Emperor Kōshō to be a legendary person, and the name Kōshō"-tennō" was created for him posthumously by later generations.
No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign.
The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.
The "Gukanshō" records that Kōshō ruled from the palace of "Ikekokoro-no-miya" at Waki-no-kami in what will come to be known as Yamato province.
Kōshō is almost certainly a legend.
The "Kojiki" records only his name and genealogy.
The "Nihonshoki" includes Kōshō as the fourth of "eight undocumented monarchs" (欠史八代, "Kesshi-hachidai").
Emperor Kōshō was the oldest son of Emperor Itoku.
"Jinnō Shōtōki" records that his mother was Amanotoyototsu-hime, and his grandmother by his mother's side was Okishimimi-no-kami.
The absence of information about Kōshō does not show that he was not real.
Very little information is available for study before the rule of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei (509?-
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Kōshō.
The actual site of his grave is not known.
According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara.
