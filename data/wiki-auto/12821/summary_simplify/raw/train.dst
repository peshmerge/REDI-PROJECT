Gates may prevent or control the entry or exit of individuals, or they may be merely decorative.
The word is derived from old Norse "gat", meaning road or path, and originally referred to the gap in the wall or fence, rather than the barrier which closed it.
The moving part or parts of a gateway may be considered "doors", as they are fixed at one side whilst opening and closing like one.
A gate may have a latch that can be raised and lowered to both open a gate or prevent it from swinging.
Larger gates can be used for a whole building, such as a castle or fortified town.
Actual doors can also be considered gates when they are used to block entry as prevalent within a gatehouse.
