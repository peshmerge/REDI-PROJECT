Emperor Kōrei (孝霊天皇, Kōrei-tennō) was the 7th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
Historians consider Emperor Kōrei to be a legendary person; and the name Kōrei"-tennō" was created for him posthumously by later generations.
No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign.
The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.
The "Gukanshō" records that Kōrei ruled from the palace of "Ihoto-no-miya" at Kuroda in what will come to be known as Yamato province.
Kōrei is almost certainly a legend.
The "Kojiki" records only his name and genealogy.
The "Nihonshoki" includes Kōrei as the sixth of "eight undocumented monarchs" (欠史八代, "Kesshi-hachidai").
Kōrei was the eldest son of Emperor Kōan.
"Jinnō Shōtōki" records that his mother was Oshihime, who was the daughter of Ametarashihiko-Kunio-shihito-no-mikoto.
Some scholars question the existence of the first nine emperors.
These critics consider Kōrei's great-grandson (Emperor Sujin) to be the earliest to have actually existed.
The absence of information about Kōrei does not imply that no such person ever existed.
Very little information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.
The "Kojiki" notes that it was during Kōrei's reign that Kibi Province was conquered.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Kōrei.
The actual site of his grave is not known.
According to the Imperial Household Agency, this emperor is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara.
