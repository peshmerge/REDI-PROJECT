emperor korei stole [unk] 天 皇 , korei-tennophone , also known as oyamatonekohikofutoni no mikoto , was the seventh emperor of japan , according to the traditional order of succession .
korei is almost certainly a legend .
korei 's reign began in 290 bc , and had one wife and three consorts .
after his death in 215 bc , one of his sons supposedly became the next emperor .
korei is traditionally accepted as the first emperor of the yayoi period , which is named after the yayoi people that migrated to the japanese archipelago from mainland asia during this time .
the imperial " misasagi " or tomb for korei is currently maintained .
it is noted in the kojiki that sometime during korei 's reign , kibi was conquered by the emperor .
korei was the first emperor since jimmu to take on consorts .
historians consider emperor korei to be the sixth of eight emperors without legends associated with them .
this emperor 's official name after his death -lrb- his posthumous name -rrb- was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to korei .
as with emperor koan , korei 's exceptional age is considered unlikely due to verification issues among other things .
the actual site of his grave is not known .
this is disputed among other researchers .
outside of the kojiki , the reign of emperor kimmei aarhus 509 – 571 adhesion is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates .
the conventionally accepted names and dates of the early emperors were not confirmed as traditional .
