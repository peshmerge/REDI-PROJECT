Emperor Kōrei (孝霊天皇 , Kōrei-tennō ) , also known as "Ōyamatonekohikofutoni no Mikoto" (大倭根子日子賦斗邇命 ) was the seventh Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
Kōrei is known as a "legendary emperor" among historians as his actual existence is disputed.
Kōrei's reign allegedly began in 290 BC, he had one wife and three consorts of which he fathered seven children with.
After his death in 215 BC, one of his sons supposedly became the next emperor.
Kōrei is traditionally accepted as the first emperor of the Yayoi period, which is named after the Yayoi people that migrated to the Japanese archipelago from mainland Asia during this time.
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and an Imperial "misasagi" or tomb for Kōrei is currently maintained; however, no extant contemporary records have been discovered that confirm a view that this historical figure actually reigned.
It is noted in the Kojiki that sometime during Kōrei's reign, Kibi was conquered by the emperor.
Kōrei was the first emperor since Jimmu to take on consorts, and fathered seven children with them along with his chief wife Empress: Kuwashi-hime.
Kōrei is thus regarded by historians as a "legendary Emperor", and is considered to have been the sixth of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them.
His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Kōrei, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the Yamato dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the "Kojiki".
As with Emperor Kōan, Kōrei's exceptional age of 127 is considered unlikely due to verification issues among other things.
While the actual site of Kōrei's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") in Ōji.
Historian Louis Frédéric notes this idea in his book "Japan Encyclopedia" where he says it is "very likely", but this remains disputed among other researchers.
Outside of the Kojiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( 509 – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates.
The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as "traditional" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.
