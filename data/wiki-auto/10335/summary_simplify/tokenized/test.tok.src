[CLS] the victims of death camps were primarily killed by gas ##sing , either in permanent installations constructed for this specific purpose , or by means of gas vans . [SEP]
[CLS] some nazi camps , such as auschwitz and maj ##dan ##ek , served a dual purpose before the end of the war in 1945 : ex ##ter ##mina ##tion by poison gas , but also through extreme work under starvation conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea of mass ex ##ter ##mina ##tion with the use of stationary facilities to which the victims were taken by train , was the result of earlier nazi experimentation with chemical ##ly manufactured poison gas during the secretive ak ##tion t ##4 eu ##than ##asia programme against hospital patients with mental and physical disabilities . [SEP]
[CLS] the technology was adapted , expanded , and applied in wartime to un ##sus ##pe ##cting victims of many ethnic and national groups ; the jews were the primary target , accounting for over 90 percent of the ex ##ter ##mina ##tion camp death toll . [SEP]
[CLS] ex ##ter ##mina ##tion camps were also set up by the fascist us ##tase regime of the independent state of croatia , a puppet state of germany , which carried out genocide between 1941 and 1945 against serbs , jews , roma and its cr ##oat and bosnia ##k muslim political opponents . [SEP]
[CLS] after the invasion of poland in september 1939 , the secret ak ##tion t ##4 eu ##than ##asia programme – the systematic murder of german , austrian and polish hospital patients with mental or physical disabilities – was initiated by the " ss " in order to eliminate " life un ##worthy of life " , a nazi designation for people who had no right to life . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1941 , the experience gained in the secretive killing of these hospital patients led to the creation of ex ##ter ##mina ##tion camps for the implementation of the final solution . [SEP]
[CLS] by then , the jews were already confined to new ghetto ##s and interned in nazi concentration camps along with other targeted groups , including roma , and the soviet pow ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the nazi " end ##los ##ung der jude ##n ##fra ##ge " ( the final solution of the jewish question ) , based on the systematic killing of europe ' s jews by gas ##sing , began during operation rein ##hard , after the onset of the nazi - soviet war of june 1941 . [SEP]
[CLS] the adoption of the gas ##sing technology by nazi germany was preceded by a wave of hands - on killings carried out by the ss " ein ##sat ##z ##gr ##uppe ##n " , who followed the wehrmacht army during operation bar ##bar ##ossa on the eastern front . [SEP]
[CLS] the camps designed specifically for the mass gas ##sing ##s of jews were established in the months following the wan ##nse ##e conference chaired by rein ##hard hey ##drich in january 1942 in which the principle was made clear that the jews of europe were to be ex ##ter ##minated . [SEP]
[CLS] responsibility for the logistics were to be executed by the programme administrator , adolf e ##ich ##mann . [SEP]
[CLS] on 13 october 1941 , the ss and police leader odi ##lo g ##lo ##bo ##c ##nik station ##ing in lublin received an oral order from " reich ##sf ##uh ##rer - ss " heinrich him ##mler – anticipating the fall of moscow – to start immediate construction work on the killing centre at be ##ł ##ze ##c in the general government territory of occupied poland . [SEP]
[CLS] notably , the order preceded the wan ##nse ##e conference by three months , but the gas ##sing ##s at ku ##lm ##hof north of łodz using gas vans began already in december , under " stu ##rm ##ban ##n ##fu ##hrer " herbert lange . [SEP]
[CLS] the camp at be ##ł ##ze ##c was operational by march 1942 , with leadership brought in from germany under the guise of organisation tod ##t ( ot ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the execution ##ers did not expect the prisoners to survive more than a few hours beyond arrival at bel ##ze ##c , sob ##ib ##or , and tre ##bl ##ink ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] the rein ##hard ex ##ter ##mina ##tion camps were under g ##lo ##bo ##c ##nik ' s direct command ; each of them was run by 20 to 35 men from the " ss - to ##ten ##ko ##pf ##ver ##band ##e " branch of the " sc ##hu ##tz ##sta ##ffe ##l " , augmented by about one hundred tr ##aw ##nik ##is – aux ##ilia ##ries mostly from soviet ukraine , and up to one thousand " son ##der ##ko ##mma ##ndo " slave labourers each . [SEP]
[CLS] the jewish men , women and children were delivered from the ghetto ##s for " special treatment " in an atmosphere of terror by uniformed police battalions from both , or ##po and sc ##hu ##po . [SEP]
[CLS] from march 1936 , all nazi concentration camps were managed by the " ss - to ##ten ##ko ##pf ##ver ##band ##e " ( the skull units , ss - tv ) , who operated ex ##ter ##mina ##tion camps from 1941 as well . [SEP]
[CLS] an ss ana ##tom ##ist , dr . johann k ##rem ##er , after witnessing the gas ##sing of victims at bi ##rke ##na ##u , wrote in his diary on 2 september 1942 : " dante ' s inferno seems to me almost a comedy compared to this . [SEP]
[CLS] the distinction was evident during the nuremberg trials , when dieter wi ##sl ##ice ##ny ( a deputy to adolf e ##ich ##mann ) was asked to name the " ex ##ter ##mina ##tion " camps , and he identified auschwitz and maj ##dan ##ek as such . [SEP]
[CLS] prisoners represented about a quarter of the total workforce of the reich , with mortality rates exceeding 75 percent due to starvation , disease , exhaustion , executions , and physical brutality . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early years of world war ii , the jews were primarily sent to forced labour camps and ghetto ##ised , but from 1942 onward they were deported to the ex ##ter ##mina ##tion camps under the guise of " reset ##tlement " . [SEP]
[CLS] for political and logistical reasons , the most infamous nazi german killing factories were built in occupied poland , where most of the intended victims lived ; poland had the greatest jewish population in nazi - controlled europe . [SEP]
[CLS] during the initial phase of the final solution , gas vans producing poisonous exhaust fu ##mes were developed in the occupied soviet union ( ussr ) and at the che ##ł ##m ##no ex ##ter ##mina ##tion camp in occupied poland , before being used elsewhere . [SEP]
[CLS] the killing method was based on experience gained by the ss during the secretive " ak ##tion t ##4 " programme of involuntary eu ##than ##asia . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike at auschwitz , where the cy ##ani ##de - based z ##yk ##lon - b was used to ex ##ter ##minate train ##load ##s of prisoners under the guise of " relocation " , the camps at tre ##bl ##ink ##a , be ##ł ##ze ##c , and sob ##ib ##or , built during operation rein ##hard ( october 1941 – november 1943 ) , used lethal exhaust fu ##mes produced by large internal combustion engines . [SEP]
[CLS] the three killing centres of " ein ##sat ##z rein ##hard " were constructed predominantly for the ex ##ter ##mina ##tion of poland ' s jews trapped in the nazi ghetto ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] at first , the victim ' s bodies were buried with the use of crawl ##er ex ##ca ##vat ##ors , but they were later ex ##hum ##ed and inc ##iner ##ated in open - air p ##yre ##s to hide the evidence of genocide in what became known as son ##der ##ak ##tion 100 ##5 . [SEP]
[CLS] whereas the auschwitz ii ( auschwitz – bi ##rke ##na ##u ) and maj ##dan ##ek camps were parts of a labor camp complex , the che ##ł ##m ##no and operation rein ##hard death camps were built exclusively for the rapid ex ##ter ##mina ##tion of entire communities of people ( primarily jews ) within hours of their arrival . [SEP]
[CLS] all were constructed near branch lines that linked to the polish railway system , with staff members transferring between locations . [SEP]
[CLS] these camps had almost identical design : they were several hundred metres in length and width , and were equipped with only minimal staff housing and support installations not meant for the un ##lu ##cky horde ##s cr ##ammed into the railway transports . [SEP]
[CLS] the nazis dec ##ei ##ved the victims upon their arrival , telling them that they were at a temporary transit stop , and would soon continue to german " ar ##bei ##ts ##lage ##rs " ( work camps ) farther to the east . [SEP]
[CLS] selected able - bodied prisoners delivered to the death camps were not immediately killed , but instead were pressed into labor units called " son ##der ##ko ##mma ##ndo ##s " to help with the ex ##ter ##mina ##tion process by removing corpses from the gas chambers and burning them . [SEP]
[CLS] at the camps of operation rein ##hard , including be ##ł ##ze ##c , sob ##ib ##or , and tre ##bl ##ink ##a , train ##load ##s of prisoners were destined for immediate death in gas chambers designed exclusively for that purpose . [SEP]
[CLS] the mass killing facilities were developed at about the same time inside the auschwitz ii - bi ##rke ##na ##u sub ##camp of a forced labour complex , and at the maj ##dan ##ek concentration camp . [SEP]
[CLS] auschwitz , maj ##dan ##ek , and jase ##nova ##c were retro ##fi ##tted with z ##yk ##lon - b gas chambers and cr ##ema ##tori ##a buildings as the time went on , remaining operational until war ' s end in 1945 . [SEP]
[CLS] after a refit the van was then sent to mal ##y tr ##ost ##ine ##ts for use at the camp there . [SEP]
[CLS] others were either transported to be ##ł ##ze ##c or victims of mass shooting ##s on two slopes in the pia ##ski sand - hills behind the camp . [SEP]
[CLS] death camps were established by the fascist us ##tase government for contributing to the nazi " final solution " to the " jewish problem " , the killing of roma people , and the elimination of political opponents , but most significantly to achieve the destruction of the serbian population of the n ##dh . [SEP]
[CLS] strong men who were capable of labour and sentenced to less than three years of inca ##rce ##ration were allowed to live . [SEP]
[CLS] others were performed manually with tools such as mall ##ets and agricultural knives and these tools were often used to throw victims off the end of a ramp into the river sava . [SEP]
[CLS] after the war , the diary of the auschwitz commandant , rudolf ho ##ss , revealed that psychological ##ly " unable to endure wadi ##ng through blood any longer " , many " ein ##sat ##zko ##mma ##ndo ##s " – the killers – either went mad or killed themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] the nazis had first used gas ##sing with carbon mono ##xide cylinders to kill 70 , 000 disabled people in germany in what they called a ' eu ##than ##asia programme ' to disguise that mass murder was taking place . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the lethal effects of carbon mono ##xide , this was seen as unsuitable for use in the east due to the cost of transporting the carbon mono ##xide in cylinders . [SEP]
[CLS] the crystals were made to order by the i ##g far ##ben chemicals company for which the brand name was z ##yk ##lon - b . [SEP]
[CLS] fritz ##ch tried out the effect of z ##yk ##lon b on soviet pow ##s , who were locked up in cells in the basement of the bunker for this experiment . [SEP]
[CLS] ho ##ss on his return was brief ##ed and impressed with the results and this became the camp strategy for ex ##ter ##mina ##tion as it was also to be at maj ##dan ##ek . [SEP]
[CLS] he recounted that , on 19 august 1942 , he arrived at bel ##ze ##c ex ##ter ##mina ##tion camp ( which was equipped with carbon mono ##xide gas chambers ) and was shown the un ##loading of 45 train cars filled with 6 , 700 jews , many already dead . [SEP]
[CLS] auschwitz camp commandant rudolf ho ##ss reported that the first time z ##yk ##lon b pe ##llet ##s were used on the jews , many suspected they were to be killed – despite having been dec ##ei ##ved into believing they were to be del ##ouse ##d and then returned to the camp . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , the nazis identified and isolated " difficult individuals " who might alert the prisoners , and removed them from the mass – lest they inc ##ite revolt among the dec ##ei ##ved majority of prisoners en route to the gas chambers . [SEP]
[CLS] a prisoner " son ##der ##ko ##mma ##ndo " ( special detachment ) effect ##ed in the processes of ex ##ter ##mina ##tion ; they encouraged the jews to und ##ress without a hint of what was about to happen . [SEP]
[CLS] they accompanied them into the gas chambers outfit ##ted to appear as shower rooms ( with non ##working water no ##zzle ##s , and tile walls ) ; and remained with the victims until just before the chamber door closed . [SEP]
[CLS] the " son ##der ##ko ##mma ##ndo " talked to the victims about life in the camp to pac ##ify the suspicious ones , and hurried them inside ; to that effect , they also assisted the aged and the very young in und ##ress ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] camp commandant ho ##ss reported that the " men of the special detachment were particularly on the look - out for this " , and encouraged the women to take their children into the " shower room " . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , the " son ##der ##ko ##mma ##ndo " comfort ##ed older children who might cry " because of the strange ##ness of being und ##ressed in this fashion " . [SEP]
[CLS] yet , not every prisoner was dec ##ei ##ved by such psychological tactics ; commandant ho ##ss spoke of jews " who either guessed , or knew , what awaited them , nevertheless . . . they found the courage to joke with the children , to encourage them , despite the mortal terror visible in their own eyes " . [SEP]
[CLS] some women would suddenly " give the most terrible shriek ##s while und ##ress ##ing , or tear their hair , or scream like mania ##cs " ; the " son ##der ##ko ##mma ##ndo " immediately took them away for execution by shooting . [SEP]
[CLS] in such circumstances , others , meaning to save themselves at the gas chamber ' s threshold , betrayed the identities and " revealed the addresses of those members of their race still in hiding " . [SEP]
[CLS] as a matter of political training , some high - ranked nazi party leaders and ss officers were sent to auschwitz – bi ##rke ##na ##u to witness the gas ##sing ##s ; ho ##ss reported that , " all were deeply impressed by what they saw . . . yet some . . . who had previously spoken most loudly , about the necessity for this ex ##ter ##mina ##tion , fell silent once they had actually seen the ' final solution of the jewish problem ' . " [SEP]
[CLS] as the auschwitz camp commandant rudolf ho ##ss justified the ex ##ter ##mina ##tion by explaining the need for " the iron determination with which we must carry out hitler ' s orders " ; yet saw that even " adolf e ##ich ##mann , who certainly was tough enough , had no wish to change places with me " . [SEP]
[CLS] initially , the victims were buried in mass graves , but were later cremated during " son ##der ##ak ##tion 100 ##5 " in all camps of operation rein ##hard . [SEP]
[CLS] the " son ##der ##ko ##mma ##ndo " were responsible for burning the corpses in the pits , st ##oki ##ng the fires , draining surplus body fat and turning over the " mountain of burning corpses . . . so that the draught might fan the flames " wrote commandant ho ##ss in his memoir while in the polish custody . [SEP]
[CLS] he was impressed by the dil ##igen ##ce of prisoners from the so - called special detachment who carried out their duties despite their being well aware that they , too , would meet exactly the same fate in the end . [SEP]
[CLS] he further said that the men ate and smoked " even when engaged in the gr ##is ##ly job of burning corpses which had been lying for some time in mass graves . " [SEP]
[CLS] they occasionally encountered the corpse of a relative , or saw them entering the gas chambers . [SEP]
[CLS] the efficiency of industrial ##ised killing at auschwitz - bi ##rke ##na ##u led to the construction of three buildings with cr ##ema ##tori ##a designed by specialists from the firm j . a . [SEP]
[CLS] a notable difference with the us ##tase camps as compared to the german " ss " camps was the widespread use of manual methods in the mass killings . [SEP]
[CLS] these involved instruments such as mall ##ets and agricultural knives which were often used in a manner where victims were thrown off the end of a ramp into the sava river while they were still alive . [SEP]
[CLS] most commonly ja ##do ##vn ##o victims were bound together in a line and the first few victims were murdered with rifle butt ##s or other objects . [SEP]
[CLS] hand grenades were hurled inside in order to finish off the victims . [SEP]
[CLS] this was an attempt to conceal not only the ex ##ter ##mina ##tion process but also the buried remains . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result of the secretive son ##der ##ak ##tion 100 ##5 , the camps were dismantled by commandos of condemned prisoners , their records were destroyed , and the mass graves were dug up . [SEP]
[CLS] some ex ##ter ##mina ##tion camps that remained unclear ##ed of evidence were liberated by soviet troops , who followed different standards of documentation and open ##ness than the western allies did . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless maj ##dan ##ek was captured nearly intact due to the rapid advance of the soviet red army during operation bag ##ration . [SEP]
[CLS] in the post - war period the government of the people ' s republic of poland created monuments at the ex ##ter ##mina ##tion camp sites . [SEP]
[CLS] they are popular destinations for visitors from all over the world , especially the most infamous nazi death camp , auschwitz near the town of os ##wi ##ec ##im . [SEP]
[CLS] holocaust den ##iers or ne ##gation ##ists are people and organizations who assert that the holocaust did not occur , or that it did not occur in the historically recognized manner and extent . [SEP]
[CLS] the existence of the ex ##ter ##mina ##tion camps is firmly established by test ##imo ##nies of camp survivors and final solution perpetrators , material evidence ( the remaining camps , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , widely published images in america were mostly victims of lou ##se - borne ty ##phus fever and at the bu ##chen ##wald , bel ##sen and da ##cha ##u concentration camps – the first to be liberated by american troops and the most available imagery in america . [SEP]
[CLS] in early news reports and for years afterwards these images were often used by the news media somewhat inaccurate ##ly in conjunction with descriptions of ex ##ter ##mina ##tion camps and jewish suffering . [SEP]
[CLS] holocaust den ##iers , after pointing out such common errors , put it forward as evidence that ex ##ter ##mina ##tion camps did not exist and the limited evidence about them is mostly a hoax arising out of a deliberate jewish conspiracy . [SEP]
