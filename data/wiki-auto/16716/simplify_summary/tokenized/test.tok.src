[CLS] kansas is bordered by nebraska on the north ; missouri on the east ; oklahoma on the south ; and colorado on the west . [SEP]
[CLS] kansas is named after the kansas river , which in turn was named after the kan ##sa native americans who lived along its banks . [SEP]
[CLS] the tribe ' s name ( native ##ly " " ) is often said to mean " people of the ( south ) wind " although this was probably not the term ' s original meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] for thousands of years , what is now kansas was home to numerous and diverse native american tribes . [SEP]
[CLS] tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys . [SEP]
[CLS] tribes in the western part of the state were semi - nomadic and hunted large herds of bison . [SEP]
[CLS] kansas was first settled by americans in 1827 with the establishment of fort leave ##n ##worth . [SEP]
[CLS] the pace of settlement accelerated in the 1850s , in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate . [SEP]
[CLS] when it was officially opened to settlement by the u . s . government in 1854 with the kansas – nebraska act , abolitionist free - state ##rs from new england and pro - slavery settlers from neighboring missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether kansas would become a free state or a slave state . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the area was a hot ##bed of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided , and was known as bleeding kansas . [SEP]
[CLS] the abolitionist ##s prevailed , and on january 29 , 1861 , kansas entered the union as a free state , hence the unofficial nickname " the free state . " [SEP]

[CLS] kansas territory stretched all the way to the continental divide and included the sites of present - day denver , colorado springs , and pueblo . [SEP]
[CLS] missouri and arkansas sent settlers into kansas all along its eastern border . [SEP]
[CLS] these settlers attempted to sway votes in favor of slavery . [SEP]
[CLS] the secondary settlement of americans in kansas territory were abolitionist ##s from massachusetts and other free - state ##rs , who attempted to stop the spread of slavery from neighboring missouri . [SEP]

[CLS] he was round ##ly condemned by both the conventional confederate military and the partisan rangers commissioned by the missouri legislature . [SEP]

[CLS] the state ' s western half has exposure ##s of cretaceous through tertiary sediments , the latter derived from the erosion of the up ##lift ##ed rocky mountains to the west . [SEP]
[CLS] these are under ##lain by older pale ##oz ##oic and me ##so ##zo ##ic sediments which co ##rre ##late well with the out ##cr ##ops to the east . [SEP]
[CLS] the state ' s northeastern corner was subjected to g ##la ##ciation in the pleistocene and is covered by glacial drift and lo ##ess . [SEP]
[CLS] the western two - thirds of the state , lying in the great central plain of the united states , has a generally flat or und ##ulating surface , while the eastern third has many hills and forests . [SEP]
[CLS] the land gradually rises from east to west ; its altitude ranges from 68 ##4 ft along the verdi ##gr ##is river at co ##ffey ##ville in montgomery county , to 403 ##9 ft at mount sun ##flower , 0 . 5 mi from the colorado border , in wallace county . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a common mis ##con ##ception that kansas is the flat ##test state in the nation — in 2003 , a tongue - in - cheek study famously declared the state " flat ##ter than a pan ##cake " . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , kansas has a maximum topographic relief of 336 ##0 ft , making it the 23rd flat ##test u . s . state measured by maximum relief . [SEP]
[CLS] nearly 75 mi of the state ' s northeastern boundary is defined by the missouri river . [SEP]
[CLS] the kansas river ( locally known as the ka ##w ) , formed by the junction of the smoky hill and republican rivers at appropriately - named junction city , joins the missouri river at kansas city , after a course of 170 mi across the northeastern part of the state . [SEP]
[CLS] the arkansas river ( pronunciation varies ) , rising in colorado , flows with a bending course for nearly 500 mi across the western and southern parts of the state . [SEP]

[CLS] kansas ' s other rivers are the saline and solomon rivers , tributaries of the smoky hill river ; the big blue , delaware , and wa ##kar ##usa , which flow into the kansas river ; and the mara ##is des cy ##gne ##s , a tributary of the missouri river . [SEP]
[CLS] spring river is located between river ##ton and baxter springs . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the koppen climate classification , kansas ' s climate can be characterized in terms of three types : it has humid continental , semi - arid steppe , and humid subtropical . [SEP]
[CLS] the eastern two - thirds of the state ( especially the northeastern portion ) has a humid continental climate , with cool to cold winters and hot , often humid summers . [SEP]
[CLS] most of the precipitation falls during both the summer and the spring . [SEP]
[CLS] the western third of the state – from roughly the u . s . route 83 corridor westward – has a semi ##ari ##d steppe climate . [SEP]
[CLS] summers are hot , often very hot , and generally less humid . [SEP]
[CLS] winters are highly change ##able between warm and very cold . [SEP]
[CLS] the western region receives an average of about 16 in of precipitation per year . [SEP]
[CLS] chin ##ook winds in the winter can warm western kansas all the way into the 80 °f range . [SEP]
[CLS] the far south - central and southeastern portions of the state , including the wichita area , have a humid subtropical climate with hot and humid summers , mild ##er winters , and more precipitation than elsewhere in kansas . [SEP]
[CLS] some features of all three climates can be found in most of the state , with drought ##s and change ##able weather between dry and humid not uncommon , and both warm and cold spells in the winter . [SEP]
[CLS] temperatures in areas between u . s . routes 83 and 81 , as well as the southwestern portion of the state along and south of u . s . 50 , reach 90 °f or above on most days of june , july , and august . [SEP]
[CLS] high humidity added to the high temperatures sends the heat index into life - threatening territory , especially in wichita , hutchinson , sal ##ina , russell , hays , and great bend . [SEP]
[CLS] temperatures are often higher in dodge city , garden city , and liberal , but the heat index in those three cities is usually lower than the actual air temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] although temperatures of 100 °f or higher are not as common in areas east of u . s . 81 , higher humidity and the urban heat island effect lead most summer days to heat indices between 107 °f and 114 °f in top ##eka , lawrence , and the kansas city metropolitan area . [SEP]
[CLS] during the summer , nightly low temperatures in the northeastern part of the state , especially in the aforementioned large cities , struggle to fall below 80 °f . [SEP]
[CLS] also , combined with humidity between 85 and 95 percent , dangerous heat indices can be experienced at every hour of the day . [SEP]
[CLS] precipitation ranges from about 47 in annually in the state ' s southeast corner to about 16 in in the southwest . [SEP]
[CLS] snowfall ranges from around 5 in in the fringe ##s of the south , to 35 in in the far northwest . [SEP]
[CLS] frost - free days range from more than 200 days in the south , to 130 days in the northwest . [SEP]

[CLS] western kansas is as sunny as california and arizona . [SEP]
[CLS] kansas is prone to severe weather , especially in the spring and the early - summer . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the frequent sunshine throughout much of the state , due to its location at a climatic boundary prone to intrusion ##s of multiple air masses , the state is vulnerable to strong and severe thunder ##storm ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] some of these storms become super ##cel ##l thunder ##storm ##s ; these can produce some tornadoes , occasionally those of e ##f ##3 strength or higher . [SEP]
[CLS] kansas averages over 50 tornadoes annually . [SEP]
[CLS] severe thunder ##storm ##s sometimes drop some very large hail over kansas as well . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , these storms can even bring in flash flooding and damaging straight line winds . [SEP]
