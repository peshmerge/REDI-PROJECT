according to gylfaginning , niflheim was the second of the two primordial realms to emanate out of ginnungagap , the other one being muspelheim , the realm of fire .
between these two realms of cold and heat , creation began when its waters mixed with the heat of muspelheim to form a " creating steam " .
later , it became the abode of hel , a goddess daughter of loki , and the afterlife for her subjects , those who did not die a heroic or notable death .
"
gylfi is informed that when loki had engendered hel , she was cast into niflheimr by odin : hel thus became the mistress of the world of those dead in disease and old age .
this is the only example in which niflheim and hel are equatedgated the poetic edda mentions hel but doesn ’ t say anything about niflheimheimorf .
there is some confusion in the different versions of the manuscript , with some of them saying niflheim where others say niflhelement the lowest level of helesthesia .
