[CLS] ni ##fl ##heim or ni ##fl ##heim ##r ( " world of mist " , literally " home of mist " ) is one of the nine worlds and is a location in norse mythology which sometimes overlap ##s with the notions of ni ##fl ##hel and he ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] the name " ni ##fl ##heim ##r " only appears in two extant sources : " g ##yl ##fa ##gin ##ning " and the much - debated " hr ##af ##na ##gal ##dr o ##รฐ ##ins " . [SEP]
[CLS] ni ##fl ##heim was primarily a realm of pri ##mo ##rdial ice and cold , with the frozen rivers of eli ##va ##gar and the well of h ##ver ##gel ##mir , from which come all the rivers . [SEP]
[CLS] according to " g ##yl ##fa ##gin ##ning " , ni ##fl ##heim was the second of the two pri ##mo ##rdial realms to em ##ana ##te out of gin ##nu ##nga ##ga ##p , the other one being mu ##sp ##el ##heim , the realm of fire . [SEP]
[CLS] between these two realms of cold and heat , creation began when its waters mixed with the heat of mu ##sp ##el ##heim to form a " creating steam " . [SEP]
[CLS] later , it became the ab ##ode of he ##l , a goddess daughter of loki , and the afterlife for her subjects , those who did not die a heroic or notable death . [SEP]
[CLS] " ni ##fl " ( " mist " ; when ##ce the icelandic " ni ##fl " ) is a co ##gna ##te to the anglo - saxon " ni ##fo ##l " ( " dark " ) , ( middle ) dutch " ne ##vel " and old high german " ne ##bu ##l " ( " fog " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in " g ##yl ##fa ##gin ##ning " by s ##nor ##ri stu ##rl ##uso ##n , g ##yl ##fi , the king of ancient scandinavia , receives an education in norse mythology from odin in the guise of three men . [SEP]
[CLS] g ##yl ##fi is furthermore informed that when loki had eng ##end ##ered he ##l , she was cast into ni ##fl ##heim ##r by odin : he ##l thus became the mistress of the world of those dead in disease and old age . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the only instance in which ni ##fl ##heim and he ##l are e ##qua ##ted ( the poetic ed ##da mentions he ##l but doesn ' t say anything about ni ##fl ##heim ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , there is some confusion in the different versions of the manuscript , with some of them saying ni ##fl ##heim where others say ni ##fl ##hel ( the lowest level of he ##l ) . [SEP]
