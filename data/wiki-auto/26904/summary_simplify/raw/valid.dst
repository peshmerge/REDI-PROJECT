The Silurian is a geologic period and system spanning 24.6 million years from the end of the Ordovician Period, at round 5 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Devonian Period, round 5 Mya.
As with other geologic periods, the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years.
The base of the Silurian is set at a series of major Ordovicianâ€“Silurian extinction events when up to 60% of marine genera were wiped out.
However, terrestrial life would not greatly diversify and affect the landscape until the Devonian.
