[CLS] the si ##lu ##rian is a geologic period and system spanning 24 . 6 million years from the end of the or ##do ##vic ##ian period , at round 5 million years ago ( my ##a ) , to the beginning of the devon ##ian period , round 5 my ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] as with other geologic periods , the rock beds that define the period ' s start and end are well identified , but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years . [SEP]
[CLS] the base of the si ##lu ##rian is set at a series of major or ##do ##vic ##ian â€“ si ##lu ##rian extinction events when up to 60 % of marine genera were wiped out . [SEP]
[CLS] however , terrestrial life would not greatly divers ##ify and affect the landscape until the devon ##ian . [SEP]
