the silurian is a period in the middle of the ordovician period , about 20 million years ago .
the silurian is the shortest period of the palaeozoic era .
as with other geologic periods , the rock beds that define the period 's start and end are well known , but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years .
the base of the silurian is set at a series of major ordovician-silurian extinction events when up to 60 % of marine species were wiped out .
a significant evolutionary milestone during the silurian was the diversification of jawed fish and bony fish .
multi-cellular life also began to appear on land in the form of small , bryophyte-like and vascular plants that grew beside lakes , streams , and coastlines .
terrestrial life would not be much different and affect the landscape until the devonian .
