The Silurian is a geologic period and system spanning 24.6 million years from the end of the Ordovician Period, at round 5 million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Devonian Period, round 5 Mya.
The Silurian is the shortest period of the Paleozoic Era.
As with other geologic periods, the rock beds that define the period's start and end are well identified, but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years.
The base of the Silurian is set at a series of major Ordovicianâ€“Silurian extinction events when up to 60% of marine genera were wiped out.
A significant evolutionary milestone during the Silurian was the diversification of jawed fish and bony fish.
Multi-cellular life also began to appear on land in the form of small, bryophyte-like and vascular plants that grew beside lakes, streams, and coastlines, and terrestrial arthropods are also first found on land during the Silurian.
However, terrestrial life would not greatly diversify and affect the landscape until the Devonian.
