[CLS] the si ##lu ##rian is a geologic period and system spanning 24 . 6 million years from the end of the or ##do ##vic ##ian period , at round 5 million years ago ( my ##a ) , to the beginning of the devon ##ian period , round 5 my ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] the si ##lu ##rian is the shortest period of the pale ##oz ##oic era . [SEP]
[CLS] as with other geologic periods , the rock beds that define the period ' s start and end are well identified , but the exact dates are uncertain by several million years . [SEP]
[CLS] the base of the si ##lu ##rian is set at a series of major or ##do ##vic ##ian â€“ si ##lu ##rian extinction events when up to 60 % of marine genera were wiped out . [SEP]
[CLS] a significant evolutionary milestone during the si ##lu ##rian was the divers ##ification of jaw ##ed fish and bony fish . [SEP]
[CLS] multi - cellular life also began to appear on land in the form of small , br ##yo ##phy ##te - like and vascular plants that grew beside lakes , streams , and coastline ##s , and terrestrial art ##hr ##op ##ods are also first found on land during the si ##lu ##rian . [SEP]
[CLS] however , terrestrial life would not greatly divers ##ify and affect the landscape until the devon ##ian . [SEP]
