In mathematics, graph theory is the study of "graphs", which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects.
A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically; see Graph (discrete mathematics) for more detailed definitions and for other variations in the types of graph that are commonly considered.
Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics.
The following are some of the more basic ways of defining graphs and related mathematical structures.
