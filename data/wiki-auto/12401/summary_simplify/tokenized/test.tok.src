[CLS] in mathematics , graph theory is the study of " graphs " , which are mathematical structures used to model pair ##wise relations between objects . [SEP]
[CLS] a distinction is made between und ##ire ##cted graphs , where edges link two vertices symmetrical ##ly , and directed graphs , where edges link two vertices as ##ym ##metric ##ally ; see graph ( discrete mathematics ) for more detailed definitions and for other variations in the types of graph that are commonly considered . [SEP]
[CLS] graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics . [SEP]
[CLS] the following are some of the more basic ways of defining graphs and related mathematical structures . [SEP]
