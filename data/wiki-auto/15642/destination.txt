January (Jan.) is the first month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, coming between December (of the previous year) and February (of the current year).
It has 31 days.
January begins on the same day of the week as October in common years, and April and July in leap years.
January ends on the same day of the week as February and October in common years, and July in leap years.
January is named for Janus, the Roman god of doors and gates.
January and February were put on the calendar after all the other months.
This is because in the original Roman calendar, winter did not have months.
Although March was originally the first month, January became the new first month because that was when people chose the new consuls (Roman leaders).
The month has 31 days.
January is a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere and a summer month in the Southern Hemisphere.

In a common year, this is October, and in a leap year, July.
Every year, January both starts and finishes on the same day of the week as May of the previous year, as each other's first and last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.
In common years immediately before other common years, January starts on the same day of the week as April and July of the following year, and in leap years and years immediately before that, September and December of the following year.
In common years immediately before other common years, January finishes on the same day of the week as July of the following year, and in leap years and years immediately before that, April and December of the following year.
