[CLS] electro ##ma ##gne ##tism is a branch of physics involving the study of the electromagnetic force , a type of physical interaction that occurs between electrically charged particles . [SEP]
[CLS] the electromagnetic force is carried by electromagnetic fields composed of electric fields and magnetic fields , is responsible for electromagnetic radiation such as light , and is one of the four fundamental interactions ( commonly called forces ) in nature . [SEP]
[CLS] the other three fundamental interactions are the strong interaction , the weak interaction , and gr ##avi ##tation . [SEP]
[CLS] at high energy the weak force and electromagnetic force are unified as a single electro ##we ##ak force . [SEP]
[CLS] electromagnetic phenomena are defined in terms of the electromagnetic force , sometimes called the loren ##tz force , which includes both electricity and magnet ##ism as different manifestation ##s of the same phenomenon . [SEP]
[CLS] the electromagnetic force plays a major role in determining the internal properties of most objects encountered in daily life . [SEP]
[CLS] the electromagnetic attraction between atomic nuclei and their orbital electrons holds atoms together . [SEP]
[CLS] electromagnetic forces are responsible for the chemical bonds between atoms which create molecules , and inter ##mo ##le ##cular forces . [SEP]
[CLS] the electromagnetic force govern ##s all chemical processes , which arise from interactions between the electrons of neighboring atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] there are numerous mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field . [SEP]
[CLS] in classical electro ##dy ##nami ##cs , electric fields are described as electric potential and electric current . [SEP]
[CLS] in far ##aday ' s law , magnetic fields are associated with electromagnetic induction and magnet ##ism , and maxwell ' s equations describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and altered by each other and by charges and currents . [SEP]
[CLS] the theoretical implications of electro ##ma ##gne ##tism , particularly the establishment of the speed of light based on properties of the " medium " of propagation ( per ##me ##ability and permit ##tiv ##ity ) , led to the development of special relativity by albert einstein in 1905 . [SEP]
[CLS] originally , electricity and magnet ##ism were considered to be two separate forces . [SEP]
[CLS] this view changed with the publication of james clerk maxwell ' s 1873 " a treatise on electricity and magnet ##ism " in which the interactions of positive and negative charges were shown to be mediated by one force . [SEP]
[CLS] there are four main effects resulting from these interactions , all of which have been clearly demonstrated by experiments : while preparing for an evening lecture on 21 april 1820 , hans christian ø ##rst ##ed made a surprising observation . [SEP]
[CLS] as he was setting up his materials , he noticed a compass needle def ##le ##cted away from magnetic north when the electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off . [SEP]
[CLS] this def ##le ##ction convinced him that magnetic fields ra ##dia ##te from all sides of a wire carrying an electric current , just as light and heat do , and that it confirmed a direct relationship between electricity and magnet ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time of discovery , ø ##rst ##ed did not suggest any satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon , nor did he try to represent the phenomenon in a mathematical framework . [SEP]
[CLS] however , three months later he began more intensive investigations . [SEP]
[CLS] soon thereafter he published his findings , proving that an electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire . [SEP]
[CLS] the c ##gs unit of magnetic induction ( o ##ers ##ted ) is named in honor of his contributions to the field of electro ##ma ##gne ##tism . [SEP]
[CLS] his findings resulted in intensive research throughout the scientific community in electro ##dy ##nami ##cs . [SEP]
[CLS] they influenced french physicist andre - marie amp ##ere ' s developments of a single mathematical form to represent the magnetic forces between current - carrying conductors . [SEP]
[CLS] ø ##rst ##ed ' s discovery also represented a major step toward a unified concept of energy . [SEP]
[CLS] this unification , which was observed by michael far ##aday , extended by james clerk maxwell , and partially reform ##ulated by oliver he ##avi ##side and heinrich her ##tz , is one of the key accomplishments of 19th - century mathematical physics . [SEP]
[CLS] it has had far - reaching consequences , one of which was the understanding of the nature of light . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike what was proposed by the electromagnetic theory of that time , light and other electromagnetic waves are at present seen as taking the form of quan ##tized , self - prop ##aga ##ting os ##ci ##lla ##tory electromagnetic field disturbances called photon ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] different frequencies of os ##ci ##llation give rise to the different forms of electromagnetic radiation , from radio waves at the lowest frequencies , to visible light at intermediate frequencies , to gamma rays at the highest frequencies . [SEP]
[CLS] ø ##rst ##ed was not the only person to examine the relationship between electricity and magnet ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1802 , gia ##n domenico roma ##gno ##si , an italian legal scholar , def ##le ##cted a magnetic needle using a volta ##ic pile . [SEP]
[CLS] the factual setup of the experiment is not completely clear , so if current flowed across the needle or not . [SEP]
[CLS] an account of the discovery was published in 1802 in an italian newspaper , but it was largely overlooked by the contemporary scientific community , because roma ##gno ##si seemingly did not belong to this community . [SEP]
[CLS] an earlier ( 1735 ) , and often neglected , connection between electricity and magnet ##ism was reported by a dr . cooks ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] the account stated : a trades ##man at wakefield in yorkshire , having put up a great number of knives and forks in a large box . . . and having placed the box in the corner of a large room , there happened a sudden storm of thunder , lightning , & c . . . . the owner empty ##ing the box on a counter where some nails lay , the persons who took up the knives , that lay on the nails , observed that the knives took up the nails . [SEP]
[CLS] on this the whole number was tried , and found to do the same , and that , to such a degree as to take up large nails , packing needles , and other iron things of considerable weight . . . e . t . w ##hit ##take ##r suggested in 1910 that this particular event was responsible for lightning to be " credited with the power of magnet ##izing steel ; and it was doubt ##less this which led franklin in 1751 to attempt to magnet ##ize a sewing - needle by means of the discharge of ley ##den jars . " [SEP]
[CLS] the electromagnetic force is one of the four known fundamental forces . [SEP]
[CLS] the other fundamental forces are : all other forces ( e . g . , friction , contact forces ) are derived from these four fundamental forces ( including momentum which is carried by the movement of particles ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the electromagnetic force is responsible for practically all phenomena one encounters in daily life above the nuclear scale , with the exception of gravity . [SEP]
[CLS] roughly speaking , all the forces involved in interactions between atoms can be explained by the electromagnetic force acting between the electrically charged atomic nuclei and electrons of the atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] electromagnetic forces also explain how these particles carry momentum by their movement . [SEP]
[CLS] this includes the forces we experience in " pushing " or " pulling " ordinary material objects , which result from the inter ##mo ##le ##cular forces that act between the individual molecules in our bodies and those in the objects . [SEP]
[CLS] the electromagnetic force is also involved in all forms of chemical phenomena . [SEP]
[CLS] a necessary part of understanding the intra - atomic and inter ##mo ##le ##cular forces is the effective force generated by the momentum of the electrons ' movement , such that as electrons move between interacting atoms they carry momentum with them . [SEP]
[CLS] as a collection of electrons becomes more confined , their minimum momentum necessarily increases due to the paul ##i exclusion principle . [SEP]
[CLS] the behaviour of matter at the molecular scale including its density is determined by the balance between the electromagnetic force and the force generated by the exchange of momentum carried by the electrons themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1600 , william gilbert proposed , in his " de magnet ##e " , that electricity and magnet ##ism , while both capable of causing attraction and rep ##ulsion of objects , were distinct effects . [SEP]
[CLS] mariners had noticed that lightning strikes had the ability to disturb a compass needle . [SEP]
[CLS] the link between lightning and electricity was not confirmed until benjamin franklin ' s proposed experiments in 1752 . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the first to discover and publish a link between man - made electric current and magnet ##ism was roma ##gno ##si , who in 1802 noticed that connecting a wire across a volta ##ic pile def ##le ##cted a nearby compass needle . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the effect did not become widely known until 1820 , when ø ##rst ##ed performed a similar experiment . [SEP]
[CLS] ø ##rst ##ed ' s work influenced amp ##ere to produce a theory of electro ##ma ##gne ##tism that set the subject on a mathematical foundation . [SEP]
[CLS] a theory of electro ##ma ##gne ##tism , known as classical electro ##ma ##gne ##tism , was developed by various physicist ##s during the period between 1820 and 1873 when it culminated in the publication of a treatise by james clerk maxwell , which unified the preceding developments into a single theory and discovered the electromagnetic nature of light . [SEP]
[CLS] in classical electro ##ma ##gne ##tism , the behavior of the electromagnetic field is described by a set of equations known as maxwell ' s equations , and the electromagnetic force is given by the loren ##tz force law . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the peculiar ##ities of classical electro ##ma ##gne ##tism is that it is difficult to reconcile with classical mechanics , but it is compatible with special relativity . [SEP]
[CLS] according to maxwell ' s equations , the speed of light in a vacuum is a universal constant that is dependent only on the electrical permit ##tiv ##ity and magnetic per ##me ##ability of free space . [SEP]
[CLS] this violate ##s gal ##ile ##an in ##var ##iance , a long - standing cornerstone of classical mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] one way to reconcile the two theories ( electro ##ma ##gne ##tism and classical mechanics ) is to assume the existence of a lu ##mini ##fer ##ous ae ##ther through which the light prop ##aga ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] however , subsequent experimental efforts failed to detect the presence of the ae ##ther . [SEP]
[CLS] after important contributions of hen ##drik loren ##tz and henri po ##in ##care , in 1905 , albert einstein solved the problem with the introduction of special relativity , which replaced classical kin ##ema ##tics with a new theory of kin ##ema ##tics compatible with classical electro ##ma ##gne ##tism . [SEP]
[CLS] ( for more information , see history of special relativity . ) [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , relativity theory implies that in moving frames of reference , a magnetic field transforms to a field with a non ##zer ##o electric component and conversely , a moving electric field transforms to a non ##zer ##o magnetic component , thus firmly showing that the phenomena are two sides of the same coin . [SEP]
[CLS] hence the term " electro ##ma ##gne ##tism " . [SEP]
[CLS] ( for more information , see classical electro ##ma ##gne ##tism and special relativity and co ##var ##ian ##t formulation of classical electro ##ma ##gne ##tism . ) [SEP]
[CLS] the maxwell equations are " linear , " in that a change in the sources ( the charges and currents ) results in a proportional change of the fields . [SEP]
[CLS] nonlinear dynamics can occur when electromagnetic fields couple to matter that follows nonlinear dynamic ##al laws . [SEP]
[CLS] this is studied , for example , in the subject of magnet ##oh ##yd ##rod ##yna ##mics , which combines maxwell theory with the na ##vier – stokes equations . [SEP]
[CLS] electromagnetic units are part of a system of electrical units based primarily upon the magnetic properties of electric currents , the fundamental si unit being the amp ##ere . [SEP]
[CLS] the units are : in the electromagnetic c ##gs system , electric current is a fundamental quantity defined via amp ##ere ' s law and takes the per ##me ##ability as a dimension ##less quantity ( relative per ##me ##ability ) whose value in a vacuum is unity . [SEP]
[CLS] as a consequence , the square of the speed of light appears explicitly in some of the equations inter ##rel ##ating quantities in this system . [SEP]
[CLS] formulas for physical laws of electro ##ma ##gne ##tism ( such as maxwell ' s equations ) need to be adjusted depending on what system of units one uses . [SEP]
[CLS] this is because there is no one - to - one correspondence between electromagnetic units in si and those in c ##gs , as is the case for mechanical units . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , within c ##gs , there are several plausible choices of electromagnetic units , leading to different unit " sub - systems " , including ga ##uss ##ian , " es ##u " , " em ##u " , and he ##avi ##side – loren ##tz . [SEP]
[CLS] among these choices , ga ##uss ##ian units are the most common today , and in fact the phrase " c ##gs units " is often used to refer specifically to c ##gs - ga ##uss ##ian units . [SEP]
