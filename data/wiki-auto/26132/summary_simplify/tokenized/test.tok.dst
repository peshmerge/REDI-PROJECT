[CLS] the rankin ##e scale is an absolute scale of the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mic temperature named after the glasgow university engineer and physicist william john mac ##qu ##orn rankin ##e , who proposed it in 1859 . [SEP]
[CLS] the symbol for degrees rankin ##e is ° ##r ( or ° ##ra if necessary to distinguish it from the r ##ø ##mer and re ##au ##mur scales ) . [SEP]
[CLS] by analogy with kelvin , some authors term the unit " rankin ##e " , om ##itt ##ing the degree symbol . [SEP]
[CLS] zero on both the kelvin and rankin ##e scales is absolute zero , but a temperature difference of one rankin ##e degree is defined as equal to one fa ##hre ##nh ##eit degree , rather than the ce ##ls ##ius degree used on the kelvin scale . [SEP]
[CLS] some important temperatures relating the rankin ##e scale to other temperature scales are shown in the table below . [SEP]
