The Rankine scale is a thermodynamic (absolute) temperature scale.
It is based around absolute zero.
Rankine is similar to the Kelvin scale in that it starts at absolute zero and 0 °Ra is the same as 0 K but is different as a change of 1 °Ra is the same as a change of 1 °F (Fahrenheit) and not 1 °C (Celsius).
Note that the abbreviation °R is ambiguous, as it can also refer to the Réaumur scale.
The Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales are defined so that absolute zero is 0 kelvins (K) or 0 degrees Rankine (°R).
The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are defined so that absolute zero is −273.15 °C or −459.67 °F.
The Rankine scale was originally used in the United States.
