the rankine scale is a absolute temperature scale of thermodynamic temperature .
it was first proposed in 1848 .
it may be used in engineering systems where heat computations are done using degrees fahrenheit .
the symbol for degrees rankine is °r ⟩ or °ra if necessary to distinguish it from the rømer and reaumur scales scales scales scales scales scales scales scales scales scales scales accordingly .
the kelvin scale is a unit of measurement of the kelvin scale .
zero on both the kelvin and rankine scales is absolute zero .
thus , a temperature of 0 k laureate −273.15eux ; −459.67cope is equal to 0 °r , and a temperature of −458.67lburg is equal to 1 °r .
the united states national institute of standards and technology recommends against using the degree symbol when using rankine in nist publications .
some important temperatures relating the rankine scale to other temperature scales are shown in the table below .
