The Rankine scale is an absolute scale of thermodynamic temperature named after the Glasgow University engineer and physicist William John Macquorn Rankine, who proposed it in 1859.
(The Kelvin scale was first proposed in 1848.)
It may be used in engineering systems where heat computations are done using degrees Fahrenheit.
The symbol for degrees Rankine is °R (or °Ra if necessary to distinguish it from the Rømer and Réaumur scales).
By analogy with Kelvin, some authors term the unit "Rankine", omitting the degree symbol.
Zero on both the Kelvin and Rankine scales is absolute zero, but a temperature difference of one Rankine degree is defined as equal to one Fahrenheit degree, rather than the Celsius degree used on the Kelvin scale.
Thus, a temperature of 0 K (−273.15 °C; −459.67 °F) is equal to 0 °R, and a temperature of −458.67 °F equal to 1 °R.
The US National Institute of Standards and Technology recommends against using the degree symbol when using Rankine in NIST publications.
Some important temperatures relating the Rankine scale to other temperature scales are shown in the table below.
