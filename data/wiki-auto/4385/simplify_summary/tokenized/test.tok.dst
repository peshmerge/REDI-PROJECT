[CLS] british railways ( br ) , which from 1965 traded as british rail , was the state - owned company that operated most of the over ##ground rail transport in great britain between 1948 and 1997 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was formed from the national ##isation of the " big four " british railway companies and lasted until the gradual pri ##vati ##sation of british rail , in stages between 1994 and 1997 . [SEP]
[CLS] originally a trading brand of the railway executive of the british transport commission , it became an independent statutory corporation in 1962 designated as the british railways board . [SEP]
[CLS] the period of national ##isation saw sweeping changes in the national railway network . [SEP]
[CLS] a process of diesel ##isation and electrification took place , and by 1968 steam loco ##mot ##ion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric traction , except for the vale of r ##hei ##do ##l railway ( a narrow - gauge tourist line ) . [SEP]
[CLS] passengers replaced freight as the main source of business , and one third of the network was closed by the beech ##ing axe of the 1960s in an effort to reduce rail subsidies . [SEP]
[CLS] on pri ##vati ##sation , responsibility for track , signalling and stations was transferred to rail ##tra ##ck ( which was later brought under public control as network rail ) and that for trains to the train operating companies . [SEP]
[CLS] the british rail " double arrow " logo is formed of two inter ##lock ##ed arrows showing the direction of travel on a double track railway and was nicknamed " the arrow of ind ##ec ##ision " . [SEP]
[CLS] it is now employed as a generic symbol on street signs in great britain den ##oting railway stations , and as part of the rail delivery group ' s ( rd ##g ) jointly - managed national rail brand is still printed on railway tickets . [SEP]
[CLS] the rail transport system in great britain developed during the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] after the grouping of 1923 under the railways act 1921 , there were four large railway companies , each dominating its own geographic area : the great western railway ( g ##wr ) , the london , midland and scottish railway ( l ##ms ) , the london and north eastern railway ( l ##ner ) and the southern railway ( sr ) . [SEP]
[CLS] during world war i the railways were under state control , which continued until 1921 . [SEP]
[CLS] complete national ##isation had been considered , and the railways act 1921 is sometimes considered as a precursor to that , but the concept was rejected . [SEP]
[CLS] national ##isation was subsequently carried out after world war ii , under the transport act 1947 . [SEP]
[CLS] this act made provision for the national ##isation of the network , as part of a policy of national ##ising public services by clement at ##tle ##e ' s labour government . [SEP]
[CLS] british railways came into existence as the business name of the railway executive of the british transport commission ( bt ##c ) on 1 january 1948 when it took over the assets of the big four . [SEP]
[CLS] there were also joint railways between the big four and a few light railways to consider ( see list of constituents of british railways ) . [SEP]
[CLS] excluded from national ##isation were industrial lines like the oxfordshire iron ##stone railway . [SEP]
[CLS] the london underground – publicly owned since 1933 – was also national ##ised , becoming the london transport executive of the british transport commission . [SEP]
[CLS] the bi ##ces ##ter military railway was already run by the government . [SEP]
[CLS] the electric liverpool overhead railway was also excluded from national ##isation . [SEP]
[CLS] the railway executive was conscious that some lines on the ( then very dense ) network were un ##pro ##fi ##table and hard to justify socially , and a programme of closure ##s began almost immediately after national ##isation . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the general financial position of br became gradually poorer , until an operating loss was recorded in 1955 . [SEP]
[CLS] the executive itself had been abolished in 1953 by the conservative government , and control of br transferred to the parent commission . [SEP]
[CLS] other changes to the british transport commission at the same time included the return of road haul ##age to the private sector . [SEP]
[CLS] british railways was divided into regions which were initially based on the areas the former big four operated in ; later , several lines were transferred between regions . [SEP]
[CLS] notably , these included the former great central lines from the eastern region to the london midland region , and the west of england main line from the southern region to western region [SEP]
[CLS] the north eastern region was merged with the eastern region in 1967 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1982 , the regions were abolished and replaced by " business sectors " , a process known as sector ##isation . [SEP]
[CLS] the anglia region was created in late 1987 , its first general manager being john edmond ##s , who began his appointment on 19 october 1987 . [SEP]
[CLS] full separation from the eastern region – apart from engineering design needs – occurred on 29 april 1988 . [SEP]
[CLS] it handled the services from fen ##church street and , its western boundary being her ##tford east , mel ##dre ##th and w ##hit ##tle ##sea . [SEP]
[CLS] the report , latter ##ly known as the " modern ##isation plan " , was published in january 1955 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was intended to bring the railway system into the 20th century . [SEP]
[CLS] a government white paper produced in 1956 stated that modern ##isation would help eliminate br ' s financial deficit by 1962 , but the figures in both this and the original plan were produced for political reasons and not based on detailed analysis . [SEP]
[CLS] the aim was to increase speed , reliability , safety , and line capacity through a series of measures that would make services more attractive to passengers and freight operators , thus recovering traffic lost to the roads . [SEP]
[CLS] the government appeared to end ##ors ##e the 1955 programme ( costing £1 . 2 billion ) , but did so largely for political reasons . [SEP]
[CLS] this included the withdrawal of steam traction and its replacement by diesel ( and some electric ) locomotives . [SEP]
[CLS] not all the modern ##isation ##s would be effective at reducing costs . [SEP]
[CLS] the diesel ##isation programme gave contracts primarily to british suppliers , who had limited experience of diesel locomotive manufacture , and rushed commissioning based on an expectation of rapid electrification ; this resulted in numbers of locomotives with poor designs , and a lack of standard ##isation . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time , container ##ised freight was being developed . [SEP]
[CLS] the marshall ##ing yard building programme was a failure , being based on a belief in the continued via ##bility of wagon - load traffic in the face of increasingly effective road competition , and lacking effective forward planning or realistic assessments of future freight . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2002 documentary broadcast on bbc radio four blamed the 1950s decisions for the " bel ##ea ##gue ##red " condition of the railway system at that time . [SEP]
[CLS] during the late 1950s , railway finances continued to worse ##n , whilst passenger numbers grew after restoring many services reduced during the war , and in 1959 the government stepped in , limiting the amount the bt ##c could spend without ministerial authority . [SEP]
[CLS] a white paper proposing reorganisation was published in the following year , and a new structure was brought into effect by the transport act 1962 . [SEP]
[CLS] this abolished the commission and replaced it by several separate boards . [SEP]
[CLS] these included a british railways board , which took over on 1 january 1963 . [SEP]
[CLS] following semi - secret discussions on railway finances by the government - appointed ste ##de ##ford committee in 1961 , one of its members , dr richard beech ##ing , was offered the post of chair ##ing the bt ##c while it lasted , and then becoming the first chairman of the british railways board . [SEP]
[CLS] a major traffic census in april 1961 , which lasted one week , was used in the compilation of a report on the future of the network . [SEP]
[CLS] this report — " the res ##ha ##ping of british railways " — was published by the br ##b in march 1963 . [SEP]
[CLS] the proposals , which became known as the " beech ##ing axe " , were dramatic . [SEP]
[CLS] a third of all passenger services and more than 4 , 000 of the 7 , 000 stations would close . [SEP]
[CLS] beech ##ing , who is thought to have been the author of most of the report , set out some dire figures . [SEP]
[CLS] one third of the network was carrying just 1 % of the traffic . [SEP]
[CLS] of the 18 , 000 passenger coaches , 6 , 000 were said to be used only 18 times a year or less . [SEP]
[CLS] although maintaining them cost between £3 ##m and £ ##4 ##m a year , they earned only about £ ##0 . 5 ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] most of the closure ##s were carried out between 1963 and 1970 ( including some which were not listed in the report ) while other suggested closure ##s were not carried out . [SEP]
[CLS] the closure ##s were heavily criticised at the time , and continue to be controversial . [SEP]
[CLS] a small number of stations and lines closed under the beech ##ing programme have been reopened , with further re ##open ##ings proposed . [SEP]
[CLS] a second beech ##ing report , " the development of the major trunk routes " , followed in 1965 . [SEP]
[CLS] this did not recommend closure ##s as such , but outlined a " network for development " . [SEP]
[CLS] the fate of the rest of the network was not discussed in the report . [SEP]
[CLS] the basis for calculating passenger fares changed in 1964 . [SEP]
[CLS] in future , fares on some routes — such as rural , holiday and commuter services — would be set at a higher level than on other routes ; previously , fares had been calculated using a simple rate for the distance travelled , which at the time was 3d per mile second class , and 41 ##⁄ ##2 ##d per mile first class ( equivalent to £ and £ respectively , in ) . [SEP]
[CLS] passenger levels decreased steadily from 1962 to the late 1970s , and reached a low in 1982 . [SEP]
[CLS] network improvements included completing electrification of the great eastern main line from london to norwich between 1976 and 1986 and the east coast main line from london to edinburgh between 1985 and 1990 . [SEP]
[CLS] a main line route closure during this period of relative network stability was the 1500 v dc - electrified wood ##head line between manchester and sheffield : passenger service ceased in 1970 and goods in 1981 . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of some railways which had survived the beech ##ing axe a generation earlier , but which had seen passenger services withdrawn . [SEP]
[CLS] this included the bulk of the chester and con ##nah ' s quay railway in 1992 , the br ##ier ##ley hill to walsall section of the south staffordshire line in 1993 , while the birmingham to wolverhampton section of the great western railway was closed in three phases between 1972 and 1992 . [SEP]
[CLS] a further british rail report , from a committee chaired by sir david ser ##pel ##l , was published in 1983 . [SEP]
[CLS] the ser ##pel ##l report made no recommendations as such , but did set out various options for the network including , at their most extreme , a skeletal system of less than 2000 route km . [SEP]
[CLS] this report was not welcomed , and the government decided to quietly leave it on the shelf . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , br was gradually re ##org ##ani ##sed , with the regional structure finally being abolished and replaced with business - led sectors . [SEP]
[CLS] this process , known as " sector ##isation " , led to far greater customer focus , but was cut short in 1994 with the splitting up of br for pri ##vati ##sation . [SEP]
[CLS] upon sector ##isation in 1982 , three passenger sectors were created : intercity , operating principal express services ; london & south east ( renamed network southeast in 1986 ) operating commuter services in the london area ; and provincial ( renamed regional railways in 1989 ) responsible for all other passenger services . [SEP]
[CLS] in the metropolitan counties local services were managed by the passenger transport executives . [SEP]
[CLS] provincial was the most sub ##si ##dis ##ed ( per passenger km ) of the three sectors ; upon formation , its costs were four times its revenue . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1980s british rail ran the rail riders membership club aimed at 5 - to 15 - year - olds . [SEP]
[CLS] because british railways was such a large operation , running not just railways but also ferries , steamship ##s and hotels , it has been considered difficult to anal ##yse the effects of national ##isation . [SEP]
[CLS] prices rose quickly in this period , rising 108 % in real terms from 1979 to 1994 , as prices rose by 262 % but r ##pi only increased by 154 % in the same time . [SEP]
[CLS] following national ##isation in 1948 , british railways began to adapt the corporate liver ##ies on the rolling stock it had inherited from its predecessor railway companies . [SEP]
[CLS] initially , an express blue ( followed by g ##wr - style brunswick green in 1952 ) was used on passenger locomotives , and l ##n ##wr - style lined black for mixed - traffic locomotives , but later green was more widely adopted . [SEP]
[CLS] development of a corporate identity for the organisation was hampered by the competing ambitions of the british transport commission and the railway executive . [SEP]
[CLS] the executive attempted to introduce a modern , curved logo which could also serve as the standard for station signage to ##tem ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] due to its similarity to a hot dog , it became known as the " flying sausage " . [SEP]
[CLS] br eventually adopted the common branding of the bt ##c as its first corporate logo , an art deco - style motif of a lion astrid ##e a spoke ##d wheel , designed for the bt ##c by cecil thomas ; on the bar over ##laid across the wheel , the bt ##c ' s name was replaced with the words " british railways " . [SEP]
[CLS] this logo , nicknamed the " cycling lion " , was applied from 1948 to 1956 to the sides of locomotives , while the sausage logo was adopted for station signs across great britain , each coloured according to the appropriate br region . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1956 , the bt ##c was granted a heraldic achievement by the college of arms and the lord lyon , and then bt ##c chairman brian robertson wanted a grande ##r logo for the railways . [SEP]
[CLS] br ' s second corporate logo ( 1956 – 1965 ) , designed in consultation with charles frankly ##n , adapted the original , depicting a rampant lion emerging from a heraldic crown and holding a spoke ##d wheel , all enclosed in a round ##el with the " british railways " name displayed across a bar on either side . [SEP]
[CLS] this emblem soon acquired the nickname of the " fe ##rret and dart ##board " . [SEP]
[CLS] a variant of the logo with the name in a circle was also used on locomotives . [SEP]
[CLS] the ze ##al for modern ##isation in the beech ##ing era drove the next re ##brand ##ing exercise , and br management wished to dive ##st the organisation of ana ##ch ##ron ##istic , heraldic motifs and develop a corporate identity to rival that of london transport . [SEP]
[CLS] br ' s design panel set up a working party led by milne ##r gray of the design research unit . [SEP]
[CLS] they drew up a corporate identity manual which established a coherent brand and design standard for the whole organisation , specify ##ing rail blue and pearl grey as the standard colour scheme for all rolling stock ; rail alphabet as the standard corporate type ##face , designed by jock kin ##ne ##ir and margaret calvert ; and introducing the now - iconic corporate identity symbol of the " double arrow " logo . [SEP]
[CLS] designed by gerald barney ( also of the dr ##u ) , this arrow device was formed of two inter ##lock ##ed arrows across two parallel lines , symbol ##ising a double track railway . [SEP]
[CLS] it was likened to a bolt of lightning or barbed wire , and also acquired a nickname : " the arrow of ind ##ec ##ision " . [SEP]
[CLS] a mirror image of the double arrow was used on the port side of br - owned seal ##ink ferry funnel ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the new br corporate identity and double arrow were rolled out in 1965 , and the brand name of the organisation was truncated to " british rail " . [SEP]
[CLS] the uniform ##ity of br branding continued until the process of sector ##isation was introduced in the 1980s . [SEP]
[CLS] certain br operations such as inter - city , network southeast or rail ##fr ##ei ##ght began to adopt their own identities , introducing logos and colour schemes which were essentially variants of the british rail brand . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , as sector ##isation developed into a prelude to pri ##vati ##sation , the unified british rail brand disappeared , with the notable exception of the double arrow symbol , which has survived to this day and serves as a generic trademark to denote railway services across great britain . [SEP]
[CLS] the br corporate identity manual is noted as a piece of british design history and there are plans for it to be re - published . [SEP]
[CLS] despite its national ##isation in 1947 " as one of the ' commanding heights ' of the economy " , according to some sources british rail was not profitable for most ( if not all ) of its history . [SEP]
[CLS] newspapers reported that as recently as the 1990s , public rail subsidy was counted as profit ; as early as 1961 , british railways were losing £3 ##00 , 000 a day . [SEP]
[CLS] it was thought that most of the national ##ised railways ( excluding some freight services ) would cease to operate like other un ##pro ##fi ##table pri ##vati ##sed businesses in the uk , and british rail ' s profit ##ability was questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] although the company was considered the sole public - transport option in many rural areas , the beech ##ing cuts made buses the only public transport available in some rural areas . [SEP]
[CLS] despite increases in traffic congestion and automotive fuel prices beginning to rise in the 1990s , british rail remained un ##pro ##fi ##table . [SEP]
[CLS] following sector ##isation , intercity became profitable . [SEP]
[CLS] this sector became the first long distance passenger railway in the uk to go into profit . [SEP]
[CLS] intercity became one of britain ' s top 150 companies with civil ##ised city centre to city centre travel across the nation from aberdeen and inverness in the north to poole and pen ##zan ##ce in the south . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1979 the incoming conservative government led by margaret thatcher was viewed as anti - railway , and did not want to commit public money to the railways . [SEP]
[CLS] however , british rail was allowed to spend its own money with government approval . [SEP]
[CLS] this led to a number of electrification projects being given the go - ahead , including the east coast main line , the spur from doncaster to leeds , and the lines in east anglia out of london liverpool street to norwich and king ' s lynn . [SEP]
[CLS] in the southwest , the line from bournemouth to we ##ym ##outh was electrified along with other in ##fi ##ll 750 v dc 3rd rail electrification in the south . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1988 , the line to abe ##rda ##re was reopened . [SEP]
[CLS] a british rail advertisement ( " britain ' s railway " , directed by hugh hudson ) featured some of the best known railway structures in britain , including the forth rail bridge , royal albert bridge , glen ##fin ##nan viaduct and london paddington station . [SEP]
[CLS] london liverpool street station was rebuilt , opened by queen elizabeth ii , and a new station was constructed at stan ##sted airport in 1991 . [SEP]
[CLS] the following year , the mae ##ste ##g line was reopened . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1988 , the windsor link line , greater manchester was constructed and has proven to be an important piece of infrastructure . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1989 , the narrow - gauge vale of r ##hei ##do ##l railway was preserved , becoming the first part of british rail to be pri ##vati ##sed . [SEP]
[CLS] between 1994 and 1997 , british rail was pri ##vati ##sed . [SEP]
[CLS] ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to rail ##tra ##ck on 1 april 1994 . [SEP]
[CLS] passenger operations were later franchise ##d to 25 private - sector operators and the freight services were sold to six companies , five of whom were owned by the same buyer . [SEP]
[CLS] the waterloo & city line , part of br network southeast , was not included in the pri ##vati ##sation and was transferred to london underground in december 1994 . [SEP]
[CLS] the remaining obligations of british rail were transferred to br ##b ( res ##id ##uary ) limited . [SEP]
[CLS] the pri ##vati ##sation , proposed by the conservative government in 1992 , was opposed by the labour party and the rail unions . [SEP]
[CLS] although labour initially proposed to reverse pri ##vati ##sation , the new labour manifesto of 1997 instead opposed conservative plans to pri ##vati ##se the london underground . [SEP]
[CLS] rail unions have historically opposed pri ##vati ##sation , but former associated society of locomotive engineers and fire ##men general secretary lew adams moved to work for virgin trains , and said on a 2004 radio phone - in programme : " all the time it was in the public sector , all we got were cuts , cuts , cuts . [SEP]
[CLS] and today there are more members in the trade union , more train drivers , and more trains running . [SEP]
[CLS] the reality is that it worked , we ’ ve protected jobs , and we got more jobs . " [SEP]
[CLS] the former br network , with the trunk routes of the west coast main line , east coast main line , great western main line , great eastern main line and midland main line , and other lines . [SEP]
[CLS] the narrow - gauge vale of r ##hei ##do ##l railway in ce ##red ##ig ##ion , wales became part of british railways at national ##isation . [SEP]
[CLS] although built as a working railway , in 1948 the line was principally a tourist attraction . [SEP]
[CLS] british rail operated the line using steam locomotives , long after the withdrawal of standard - gauge steam . [SEP]
[CLS] the line ' s three steam locomotives were the only ones to receive tops serial numbers and be painted in br rail blue livery with the double arrow logo . [SEP]
[CLS] the vale of r ##hei ##do ##l railway was pri ##vati ##sed in 1989 and continues to operate as a private heritage railway . [SEP]
[CLS] other preserved lines , or heritage railways , have reopened lines previously closed by british rail . [SEP]
[CLS] these range from picturesque rural branch lines like the kei ##gh ##ley and worth valley railway to sections of mainline such as the great central railway . [SEP]
[CLS] many have links to the national rail network , both at station interchange ##s , for example the severn valley railway between kidd ##er ##minster and kidd ##er ##minster town , and physical rail connections like the water ##cre ##ss line at alton . [SEP]
[CLS] although most are operated solely as leisure amenities some also provide educational resources , and a few have ambitions to restore commercial services over routes abandoned by the national ##ised industry . [SEP]
[CLS] british railways operated ships from its formation in 1948 on several routes . [SEP]
[CLS] many ships were acquired on national ##isation , and others were built for operation by british railways or its later subsidiary , seal ##ink . [SEP]
[CLS] those ships capable of carrying rail vehicles were classed under tops as class 99 . [SEP]
[CLS] seal ##ink was a ferry company based in the united kingdom from 1970 to 1984 , operating services to france , belgium , the netherlands , channel islands , isle of wight and ireland . [SEP]
[CLS] the joint hove ##rc ##raf ##t services of british rail ( under british rail hove ##rc ##raf ##t limited ) in association with the french s ##nc ##f . [SEP]
[CLS] british rail hove ##rc ##raf ##t limited was established in 1965 , under authority given to it by the british railways act 1967 and started its first service in 1966 . [SEP]
[CLS] seas ##peed started cross - channel services from dover , england to calais and bo ##ulo ##gne - sur - mer , france using sr - n ##4 hove ##rc ##raf ##t in august 1968 . [SEP]
[CLS] a family of railway carriages , designed and built by british rail workshops ( from 1969 british rail engineering limited ) ( br ##el ) between 1964 and 1975 . [SEP]
[CLS] they were of steel construction . [SEP]
[CLS] many remain in service to this day . [SEP]
[CLS] the advanced passenger train ( apt ) was an experimental tilting high speed train developed by british rail during the 1970s and early 1980s , for use on the west coast main line , which contained a lot of curves . [SEP]
[CLS] notable among numerous technical advancement ##s was the active tilting system , which the apt pioneered and has since appeared on other designs around the world . [SEP]
[CLS] the intercity 125 was and is a high speed diesel train that is widely credited with saving british rail and is usually called hs ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] it was introduced by british rail in the early 1970s . [SEP]
[CLS] under the process of british rail ' s pri ##vati ##sation , operations were split into more than 100 companies . [SEP]
[CLS] the ownership and operation of the infrastructure of the railway system was taken over by rail ##tra ##ck . [SEP]
[CLS] the telecom ##ms infrastructure and british rail telecommunications was sold to ra ##cal , which in turn was sold to global crossing and merged with tha ##les group . [SEP]
[CLS] the rolling stock was transferred to three private ro ##sco ##s ( rolling stock companies ) . [SEP]
[CLS] passenger services were divided into 25 operating companies , which were let on a franchise basis for a set period , whilst goods services were sold off completely . [SEP]
[CLS] dozens of smaller engineering and maintenance companies were also created and sold off . [SEP]
[CLS] british rail ' s passenger services came to an end upon the fran ##chi ##sing of sc ##ot ##rail ; the final train that the company operated was a rail ##fr ##ei ##ght distribution goods train in autumn 1997 . [SEP]
[CLS] the british railways board continued in existence as a corporation until early 2001 , when it was replaced with the strategic rail authority . [SEP]
[CLS] since pri ##vati ##sation , the structure of the rail industry and number of companies has changed several times as franchises have been re - let and the areas covered by franchises rest ##ructured . [SEP]
[CLS] since pri ##vati ##sation , many groups have campaigned for the ren ##ation ##alis ##ation of british rail , most notably ' bring back british rail ' . [SEP]
[CLS] various interested parties also have views on the pri ##vati ##sation of british rail . [SEP]
[CLS] the ren ##ation ##alis ##ation of the railways of britain continues to have popular support . [SEP]
[CLS] polls in 2012 and 2013 showed 70 % and 66 % support for ren ##ation ##alis ##ation , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] due to rail franchises lasting sometimes over a decade , full ren ##ation ##alis ##ation would take years unless compensation was paid to terminate contracts early . [SEP]
[CLS] when the infrastructure - owning company rail ##tra ##ck ceased trading in 2002 , the labour government set up the not - for - divide ##nd company network rail to take over the duties rather than ren ##ation ##alis ##e this part of the network . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in september 2014 , network rail was rec ##lassified as a central government body , adding around £3 ##4 billion to public sector net debt . [SEP]
[CLS] this rec ##lass ##ification had been requested by the office for budget responsibility to comply with pan - european accounting standard esa ##10 . [SEP]
[CLS] the green party has committed to bringing the railways ' back into public ownership ' and has maintained this impetus when other parties argued to maintain the status quo . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2016 , green mp , caroline lucas , put forward a bill that would have seen the rail network fall back into public ownership step by step , as franchises come up for ex ##pi ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] under jeremy co ##rb ##yn , the labour party has pledged to gradually ren ##ation ##alis ##e british rail franchises if elected , as and when their private contracts ex ##pire , creating a " people ' s railway " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1989 , the itv sketch show " spitting image " parody ##ied hudson ' s 1988 " british rail , britain ' s railway " ad ##vert on the plans of the then conservative british government to pri ##vati ##se the railways featuring many of the show ' s puppets ( including the show ' s portrayal of former prime minister margaret thatcher ) , numerous br trains and landmarks and even a cardboard cut ##out of thomas the tank engine .
