it became an independent statutory corporation in 1962 .
by 1968 steam locomotion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric traction , except for the vale of rheidol railway trunks .
passengers replaced freight as the main source of business .
the rail transport system in great britain developed during the 19th century .
after the grouping of 1923 under the railways act 1921 , there were four large railway companies .
complete nationalisation had been considered , and the railways act 1921 is sometimes considered as a precursor to that , but the concept was rejected .
this act made provision for the nationalisation of the network , as part of a policy of nationalising public services by clement attlee 's labour government .
british railways came into existence as the business name of the railway executive of the british transport commission dq btc <s> on 1 january 1948 .
there were also joint railways between the big four and a few light railways to consider constituents constituents .
the bicester military railway was already run by the government .
the railway executive was conscious that some lines on the buddha 's network were unprofitable and hard to justify socially , and a programme of closures began almost immediately after nationalisation .
however , the general financial position of br became gradually poorer , until an operating loss was recorded in 1955 .
the executive itself had been abolished in 1953 by the conservative government , and control of br changed to the parent commission .
other changes to the british transport commission at the same time included the return of road haulage to the private sector .
these included the former great central lines from the eastern region to the london midland region , and the west of england main line from the southern region to western region .
the north eastern region was merged with the eastern region in 1967 .
in 1982 the regions were abolished and replaced by " business sectors " , a process known as sectorisation .
its western boundary is hertford east , meldreth and whittlesea .
it was planned to bring the railway system into the 20th century .
a government white paper produced in 1956 stated that modernisation would help eliminate br 's financial deficit by 1962 .
the aim was to increase speed , reliability , safety , and line capacity .
the government appeared to endorse the 1955 programme costing Â£ . 2 billiondilly , but did so largely for political reasons .
the dieselisation programme gave contracts primarily to british builders , who had limited experience of diesel locomotive manufacture , and rushed commissioning based on an expectation of rapid electrification .
during the late 1950s , railway finances continued to worsen .
a new paper was made by the transport act 1962 .
then it became the first chairman of the british railways board .
a major traffic census in april 1961 was used in the compilation of a report on the future of the network .
most of the closures were carried out between 1963 and 1970 .
a small number of stations and lines closed under the beeching programme have been reopened , with further reopenings proposed .
a second beeching report , " the development of the major trunk routes " , followed in 1965 .
this did not recommend closures as such , but outlined a " network for development " .
fares on some routes would be set at a higher level than on other routes .
passenger service ceased in 1970 and goods in 1981 .
this included the chester and connah 's quay railway in 1992 , the brierley hill to walsall section of the south staffordshire line in 1993 , while the birmingham to wolverhampton section of the great western railway was closed in three phases between 1972 and 1992 .
the serpell report made no recommendations , but did set out various options for the network .
in 1986 , three passenger sectors were made : intercity , operating principal express services ; london & south east reeling renamed network southeast in 1986 c1 .
provincial was the most subsidised gallon per passenger km foley of the three sectors ; upon formation , its costs were four times its revenue .
british railways was such a large operation , running not just railways but also ferries , steamships and hotels , but it has been considered difficult to analyse the effects of nationalisation .
following nationalisation in 1948 , british railways began to adapt the corporate liveries on the rolling stock it had inherited from its predecessor railway companies .
the development of a corporate identity for the organisation was hampered by the competing ambitions of the british transport commission and the railway executive .
the executive attempted to introduce a modern , curved logo which could also be the standard for station signage totems .
the btc 's name was changed to the common branding of the btc as its first corporate logo .
the sausage logo was used for station signs across great britain .
in 1956 , the btc was granted a heraldic achievement by the college of arms and the lord lyon .
the br 's second corporate logo was designed in consultation with charles franklyn .
the zeal for modernisation in the beeching era drove the next rebranding exercise .
br 's design panel set up a working party led by milner gray of the design research unit .
they created a corporate identity manual , which established a coherent brand and design standard for the whole organisation .
it was also got a nickname : " the arrow of indecision " .
a mirror image of the double arrow was used on the port side of the sealink ferry funnels .
the brand name of the organisation was truncated to " british rail " .
certain br operations such as inter-city , network southeast or railfreight began to adopt their own identities .
eventually , as sectorisation developed into a prelude to privatisation , the unified british rail brand disappeared .
the br corporate identity manual is noted as a piece of british design history .
british rail 's profitability was questioned .
although the company was considered the sole public-transport option in many areas , the beeching cuts made buses the only public transport available in some rural areas .
despite increasing in traffic congestion and fuel prices beginning to rise in the 1990s , british rail remained unprofitable .
this sector became the first long distance passenger railway in the uk to go into profit .
in 1979 the conservative government led by margaret thatcher was viewed as anti-railway .
this led to a number of electrification projects being given the go-ahead , including the east coast main line , the spur from doncaster to leeds , and the lines in east anglia out of london liverpool street to norwich and king 's lynn .
in the southwest , the line from bournemouth to weymouth was electrified with 750 v dc 3rd rail electrification in the south .
a british rail advertisement called " britain 's railway " was shown at the forth rail bridge , the royal albert bridge , glenfinnan viaduct and london paddington station .
a new station was constructed at stansted airport in 1991 .
in 1988 , the windsor link line , greater manchester was built and has proven to be an important piece of infrastructure .
the waterloo & city line was part of the privatisation and was transferred to london underground in december 1994 .
rail unions have historically opposed privatisation , but former associated society of locomotive engineers and firemen general secretary lew adams moved to work for virgin trains .
the former br network , with the trunk routes of the west coast main line , east coast main line , great western main line , midland main line , and other lines .
the narrow gauge vale of rheidol railway in ceredigion , wales became part of british railways at nationalisation .
the line was operated by steam locomotives , long after the withdrawal of standard gauge steam .
the line 's three steam locomotives were the only one to receive tops serial numbers and be painted in br rail blue livery with the double arrow logo .
the vale of rheidol railway was taken over in 1989 and continues to operate as a private heritage railway .
these range from picturesque rural branch lines like the keighley and worth valley railway to parts of mainline such as the great central railway .
many have links to the national rail network , both at station interchanges , for example the severn valley railway between kidderminster and kidderminster town , and physical rail connections like the watercress line at alton .
most are operated solely as leisure facilities some also provide educational resources .
many ships were acquired on nationalisation , and others were built for operation by british railways or its later subsidiary , sealink .
sealink was a ferry company based in the united kingdom from 1970 to 1984 .
the advanced passenger train operator aptedge -lrb- als -rrb- was a tilting high speed train developed by british rail during the 1970s and early 1980s .
notable among many technical advancements was the active tilting system .
the ownership of the infrastructure of the railway system was taken over by railtrack .
passenger services were divided into 25 operating companies , which were let on a franchise basis for a set period .
the final train that the company operated was a railfreight distribution goods train in autumn 1997 .
the british railways board continued in existence as a corporation until early 2001 , when it was replaced with the strategic rail authority .
since privatisation , the number of companies has changed several times as franchises have been re-let and the areas covered by franchises restructured .
due to rail franchises lasting sometimes over a decade , full renationalisation would take years unless compensation was paid to terminate contracts early .
the labour government set up the not-for-dividend company network rail to take over duties rather than renationalise this part of the network .
however , in september 2014 , network rail was reclassified as a central government body .
in 2016 , the green mp , caroline lucas , said that the rail network would fall back into public ownership step by step .
under jeremy corbyn , the labour party has promised to gradually renationalise british rail franchises if elected , as and when their private contracts expire , creating a " people 's railway " .
in 1989 , the itv sketch show " spitting image " parodyied hudson 's 1988 " british rail , britain 's railway " advert on the plans of the then conservative british government to privatise the railways featuring many of the show 's puppets representing many of the show 's puppets posing including the portrayal of former prime minister margaret thatcher , numerous trains and landmarks and even a cutout of thomas brey .
