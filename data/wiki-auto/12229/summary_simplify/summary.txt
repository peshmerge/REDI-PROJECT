Like all categories discerned within forms of government, the boundaries of government classifications are either fluid or ill-defined.
Identifying a form of government is also difficult because many political systems originate as socio-economic movements and are then carried into governments by parties naming themselves after those movements; all with competing political-ideologies.
Experience with those movements in power, and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government, can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.

Federalism is a system based upon democratic principles and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments, creating what is often called a federation.
Experience with those movements in power and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.
This list focuses on differing approaches that political systems take to the distribution of sovereignty, and the autonomy of regions within the state.
