[CLS] a government is the system or group of people governing an organized community , often a state . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of its broad ass ##oc ##ia ##tive definition , government normally consists of legislature , executive , and judiciary . [SEP]
[CLS] government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced , as well as a mechanism for determining policy . [SEP]
[CLS] each government has a kind of constitution , a statement of its governing principles and philosophy . [SEP]
[CLS] typically the philosophy chosen is some balance between the principle of individual freedom and the idea of absolute state authority ( ty ##ran ##ny ) . [SEP]
[CLS] while all types of organizations have governance , the word " government " is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments on earth , as well as subsidiary organizations . [SEP]
[CLS] historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy , aristocracy , tim ##oc ##rac ##y , ol ##iga ##rchy , democracy , theo ##cr ##acy and ty ##ran ##ny . [SEP]
[CLS] the main aspect of any philosophy of government is how political power is obtained , with the two main forms being electoral contest and hereditary succession . [SEP]
[CLS] libertarian ##ism and ana ##rch ##ism are political id ##eo ##logies that seeks to limit or ab ##olis ##h government , finding government disrupt ##ive to self organization and freedom . [SEP]
[CLS] a government is the system to govern a state or community . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " government " derives , ultimately , from the greek verb κ ##υ ##β ##ε ##ρ ##ν ##α ##ω " ku ##ber ##na ##o " ( meaning " to steer " with gu ##ber ##nac ##ulum ( rudder ) , the metaphor ##ical sense being attested in plato ' s ship of state ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the columbia encyclopedia defines government as " a system of social control under which the right to make laws , and the right to enforce them , is vested in a particular group in society " . [SEP]
[CLS] while all types of organizations have governance , the word " government " is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments on earth , as well as their subsidiary organizations . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , " government " is also sometimes used in english as a synonym for governance . [SEP]
[CLS] the moment and place that the phenomenon of human government developed is lost in time ; however , history does record the formations of early governments . [SEP]
[CLS] about 5 , 000 years ago , the first small city - states appeared . [SEP]
[CLS] by the third to second millennium ##s bc , some of these had developed into larger governed areas : sum ##er , ancient egypt , the indus valley civilization , and the yellow river civilization . [SEP]
[CLS] the development of agriculture and water control projects were a catalyst for the development of governments . [SEP]
[CLS] on occasion a chief of a tribe was elected by various rituals or tests of strength to govern his tribe , sometimes with a group of elder tribes ##men as a council . [SEP]
[CLS] the human ability to precisely communicate abstract , learned information allowed humans to become ever more effective at agriculture , and that allowed for ever increasing population den ##sities . [SEP]
[CLS] starting at the end of the 17th century , the prevalence of republican forms of government grew . [SEP]
[CLS] the glorious revolution in england , the american revolution , and the french revolution contributed to the growth of representative forms of government . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet union was the first large country to have a communist government . [SEP]
[CLS] since the fall of the berlin wall , liberal democracy has become an even more prevalent form of government . [SEP]
[CLS] in the nineteenth and twentieth century , there was a significant increase in the size and scale of government at the national level . [SEP]
[CLS] this included the regulation of corporations and the development of the welfare state . [SEP]
[CLS] in political science , it has long been a goal to create a ty ##pol ##ogy or taxonomy of pol ##ities , as ty ##pol ##og ##ies of political systems are not obvious . [SEP]
[CLS] it is especially important in the political science fields of comparative politics and international relations . [SEP]
[CLS] like all categories disc ##ern ##ed within forms of government , the boundaries of government classifications are either fluid or ill - defined . [SEP]
[CLS] superficial ##ly , all governments have an official or ideal form . [SEP]
[CLS] the united states is a constitutional republic , while the former soviet union was a socialist republic . [SEP]
[CLS] however self - identification is not objective , and as ko ##ps ##tein and li ##ch ##bach argue , defining regimes can be tricky . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , volta ##ire argued that " the holy roman empire is neither holy , nor roman , nor an empire " . [SEP]
[CLS] identifying a form of government is also difficult because many political systems originate as socio - economic movements and are then carried into governments by parties naming themselves after those movements ; all with competing political - id ##eo ##logies . [SEP]
[CLS] experience with those movements in power , and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government , can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] other complications include general non - consensus or deliberate " distortion or bias " of reasonable technical definitions to political id ##eo ##logies and associated forms of governing , due to the nature of politics in the modern era . [SEP]
[CLS] for example : the meaning of " con ##ser ##vati ##sm " in the united states has little in common with the way the word ' s definition is used elsewhere . [SEP]
[CLS] as rib ##uf ##fo notes , " what americans now call con ##ser ##vati ##sm much of the world calls liberalism or neo ##lib ##eral ##ism " ; a " conservative " in finland would be labeled a " socialist " in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] since the 1950s con ##ser ##vati ##sm in the united states has been chiefly associated with the republican party . [SEP]
[CLS] however , during the era of segregation many southern democrats were conservatives , and they played a key role in the conservative coalition that controlled congress from 1937 to 1963 . [SEP]
[CLS] opinions vary by individuals concerning the types and properties of governments that exist . [SEP]
[CLS] " shades of gray " are commonplace in any government and its corresponding classification . [SEP]
[CLS] even the most liberal demo ##cr ##acies limit rival political activity to one extent or another while the most ty ##ran ##nical dictatorship ##s must organize a broad base of support thereby creating difficulties for " pigeon ##hol ##ing " governments into narrow categories . [SEP]
[CLS] examples include the claims of the united states as being a pluto ##cr ##acy rather than a democracy since some american voters believe elections are being manipulated by wealthy super pac ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the classical greek philosopher plato discusses five types of regimes : aristocracy , tim ##oc ##rac ##y , ol ##iga ##rchy , democracy and ty ##ran ##ny . [SEP]
[CLS] plato also assigns a man to each of these regimes to illustrate what they stand for . [SEP]
[CLS] the ty ##ran ##nical man would represent ty ##ran ##ny for example . [SEP]
[CLS] these five regimes progressively de ##gen ##erate starting with aristocracy at the top and ty ##ran ##ny at the bottom . [SEP]
[CLS] one method of classify ##ing governments is through which people have the authority to rule . [SEP]
[CLS] this can either be one person ( an auto ##cr ##acy , such as monarchy ) , a select group of people ( an aristocracy ) , or the people as a whole ( a democracy , such as a republic ) . [SEP]
[CLS] an auto ##cr ##acy is a system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person , whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular ##ized mechanisms of popular control ( except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d ' etat or mass insurrection ) . [SEP]
[CLS] aristocracy ( greek α ##ρ ##ι ##σ ##τ ##ο ##κ ##ρ ##α ##τ ##ια " ari ##sto ##kra ##tia " , from α ##ρ ##ι ##σ ##τ ##ος " " " excellent " , and κ ##ρ ##α ##τ ##ος " " " power " ) is a form of government that places power in the hands of a small , privileged ruling class . [SEP]
[CLS] many monarch ##ies were ari ##sto ##cr ##acies , although in modern constitutional monarch ##ies the monarch himself or herself has little real power . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " aristocracy " could also refer to the non - peasant , non - servant , and non - city classes in the feudal system . [SEP]
[CLS] democracy is a system of government where the citizens exercise power by voting . [SEP]
[CLS] in a direct democracy , the citizens as a whole form a governing body and vote directly on each issue . [SEP]
[CLS] in a representative democracy the citizens elect representatives from among themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] these representatives meet to form a governing body , such as a legislature . [SEP]
[CLS] in a constitutional democracy the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy , but the constitution limits the majority and protects the minority , usually through the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights , e . g . freedom of speech , or freedom of association . [SEP]
[CLS] a republic is a form of government in which the country is considered a " public matter " ( latin : " res public ##a " ) , not the private concern or property of the rulers , and where offices of states are subsequently directly or indirectly elected or appointed rather than inherited . [SEP]
[CLS] the people , or some significant portion of them , have supreme control over the government and where offices of state are elected or chosen by elected people . [SEP]
[CLS] a common simplified definition of a republic is a government where the head of state is not a monarch . [SEP]
[CLS] monte ##s ##qui ##eu included both demo ##cr ##acies , where all the people have a share in rule , and ari ##sto ##cr ##acies or ol ##iga ##rch ##ies , where only some of the people rule , as republican forms of government . [SEP]
[CLS] other terms used to describe different republics include democratic republic , parliamentary republic , federal republic , and islamic republic . [SEP]
[CLS] federal ##ism is a political concept in which a " group " of members are bound together by covenant with a governing representative head . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " federal ##ism " is also used to describe a system of government in which sovereignty is constitutional ##ly divided between a central governing authority and constituent political units , variously called states , provinces or otherwise . [SEP]
[CLS] federal ##ism is a system based upon democratic principles and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial / state governments , creating what is often called a federation . [SEP]
[CLS] proponents are often called federal ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , most political systems originated as socio ##economic id ##eo ##logies . [SEP]
[CLS] experience with those movements in power and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] certain major characteristics are defining of certain types ; others are historically associated with certain types of government . [SEP]
[CLS] this list focuses on differing approaches that political systems take to the distribution of sovereignty , and the autonomy of regions within the state . [SEP]
