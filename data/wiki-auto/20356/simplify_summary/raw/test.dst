The Mozambique Channel ( , , ) is an arm of the Indian Ocean located between the Southeast African countries of Madagascar and Mozambique.
The channel is about 1600 km long and 419 km across at its narrowest point, and reaches a depth of 3292 m about 230 km off the coast of Mozambique.
A warm current, the Mozambique Current, flows in a southward direction in the channel, leading into the Agulhas Current off the east coast of South Africa.
Despite being defined as the South African coast by the IHO, the western limit of the channel is more correctly defined as the coast of Southern Africa or, more specifically, of Mozambique.
