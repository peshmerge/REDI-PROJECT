Emperor Senka (宣化天皇 , Senka-tennō ) was the 28th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
No firm dates can be assigned to this Emperor's life or reign, but he is conventionally considered to have reigned from 536–539.
Keitai is considered to have ruled the country during the early-6th century, but there is a paucity of information about him.
Emperor Senka was elderly at the time of his enthronement; and his reign is said to have endured for only three years.
Senka's contemporary title would not have been "tennō", as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō.
The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") at Nara.
It is formally named "Musa no Tsukisaka no e no misasagi"; however, the actual sites of the graves of the early Emperors remain problematic, according to some historians and archaeologists.
