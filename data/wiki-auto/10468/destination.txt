Emperor Senka (宣化天皇, Senka-tennō) was the 28th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Senka to be possibly legendary, but probable.
The name Senka"-tennō" was created for him posthumously by later generations.
No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign.
The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.
According to "Kojiki", Senka was a son of Emperor Keitai.
When Emperor Ankan died childless, the throne passed to his brother Senka.
Very little is known about the events of Senka's life and reign.
Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.
During this reign, Soga no Iname became the first verifiable "Great Minister" or "Omi" (also identified as "Ō-omi").
The reign of Emperor Senka lasted for three years.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Senka.
According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun").
Senka is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") which is associated with the burial mound.
