[CLS] a harmonic series is the sequence of sounds — pure tones , represented by sin ##uso ##idal waves — in which the frequency of each sound is an integer multiple of the fundamental , the lowest frequency . [SEP]
[CLS] pitched musical instruments are often based on an acoustic res ##ona ##tor such as a string or a column of air , which os ##ci ##lla ##tes at numerous modes simultaneously . [SEP]
[CLS] at the frequencies of each vibrating mode , waves travel in both directions along the string or air column , rein ##for ##cing and cancel ##ing each other to form standing waves . [SEP]
[CLS] interaction with the surrounding air causes audible sound waves , which travel away from the instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the typical spa ##cing of the resonance ##s , these frequencies are mostly limited to integer multiple ##s , or harmonic ##s , of the lowest frequency , and such multiple ##s form the harmonic series ( see harmonic series ( mathematics ) ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the musical pitch of a note is usually perceived as the lowest partial present ( the fundamental frequency ) , which may be the one created by vibration over the full length of the string or air column , or a higher harmonic chosen by the player . [SEP]
[CLS] the musical tim ##bre of a steady tone from such an instrument is strongly affected by the relative strength of each harmonic . [SEP]
[CLS] a " complex tone " ( the sound of a note with a tim ##bre particular to the instrument playing the note ) " can be described as a combination of many simple periodic waves ( i . e . , sin ##e waves ) or " partial ##s , " each with its own frequency of vibration , amplitude , and phase . " [SEP]
[CLS] ( see also , fourier analysis . ) [SEP]
[CLS] a partial is any of the sin ##e waves ( or " simple tones " , as ellis calls them when translating helm ##hol ##tz ) of which a complex tone is composed , not necessarily with an integer multiple of the lowest harmonic . [SEP]
[CLS] a harmonic is any member of the harmonic series , an ideal set of frequencies that are positive integer multiple ##s of a common fundamental frequency . [SEP]
[CLS] the fundamental is obviously a harmonic because it is 1 times itself . [SEP]
[CLS] a harmonic partial is any real partial component of a complex tone that matches ( or nearly matches ) an ideal harmonic . [SEP]
[CLS] an in ##har ##mon ##ic partial is any partial that does not match an ideal harmonic . [SEP]
[CLS] " in ##har ##mon ##ici ##ty " is a measure of the deviation of a partial from the closest ideal harmonic , typically measured in cents for each partial . [SEP]
[CLS] many pitched acoustic instruments are designed to have partial ##s that are close to being whole - number ratios with very low in ##har ##mon ##ici ##ty ; therefore , in music theory , and in instrument design , it is convenient , although not strictly accurate , to speak of the partial ##s in those instruments ' sounds as " harmonic ##s " , even though they may have some degree of in ##har ##mon ##ici ##ty . [SEP]
[CLS] the piano , one of the most important instruments of western tradition , contains a certain degree of in ##har ##mon ##ici ##ty among the frequencies generated by each string . [SEP]
[CLS] other pitched instruments , especially certain percussion instruments , such as mari ##mba , vi ##bra ##phone , tubular bells , tim ##pani , and singing bowls contain mostly in ##har ##mon ##ic partial ##s , yet may give the ear a good sense of pitch because of a few strong partial ##s that resemble harmonic ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] un ##pit ##ched , or indefinite - pitched instruments , such as cy ##mba ##ls and tam - tam ##s make sounds ( produce spectra ) that are rich in in ##har ##mon ##ic partial ##s and may give no impression of implying any particular pitch . [SEP]
[CLS] an over ##tone is any partial above the lowest partial . [SEP]
[CLS] the term over ##tone does not imply harmonic ##ity or in ##har ##mon ##ici ##ty and has no other special meaning other than to exclude the fundamental . [SEP]
[CLS] it is mostly the relative strength of the different over ##tones that give an instrument its particular tim ##bre , tone color , or character . [SEP]
[CLS] when writing or speaking of over ##tones and partial ##s numerical ##ly , care must be taken to designate each correctly to avoid any confusion of one for the other , so the second over ##tone may not be the third partial , because it is the second sound in a series . [SEP]
[CLS] some electronic instruments , such as synthesizers , can play a pure frequency with no over ##tones ( a sin ##e wave ) . [SEP]
[CLS] synthesizers can also combine pure frequencies into more complex tones , such as to simulate other instruments . [SEP]
[CLS] certain flutes and o ##car ##inas are very nearly without over ##tones . [SEP]
[CLS] the simplest case to visual ##ise is a vibrating string , as in the illustration ; the string has fixed points at each end , and each harmonic mode divides it into 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , etc . , equal - sized sections res ##ona ##ting at increasingly higher frequencies . [SEP]
[CLS] similar arguments apply to vibrating air columns in wind instruments ( for example , " the french horn was originally a valve ##less instrument that could play only the notes of the harmonic series " ) , although these are complicated by having the possibility of anti - nodes ( that is , the air column is closed at one end and open at the other ) , conical as opposed to cylindrical bore ##s , or end - openings that run the ga ##mut from no flare , cone flare , or exponential ##ly shaped flare ##s ( such as in various bells ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in most pitched musical instruments , the fundamental ( first harmonic ) is accompanied by other , higher - frequency harmonic ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] thus shorter - wavelength , higher - frequency waves occur with varying prominence and give each instrument its characteristic tone quality . [SEP]
[CLS] the fact that a string is fixed at each end means that the longest allowed wavelength on the string ( which gives the fundamental frequency ) is twice the length of the string ( one round trip , with a half cycle fitting between the nodes at the two ends ) . [SEP]
[CLS] other allowed wavelengths are 1 / 2 , 1 / 3 , 1 / 4 , 1 / 5 , 1 / 6 , etc . times that of the fundamental . [SEP]
[CLS] theoretically , these shorter wavelengths correspond to vibrations at frequencies that are 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , etc . , times the fundamental frequency . [SEP]
[CLS] physical characteristics of the vibrating medium and / or the res ##ona ##tor it vi ##brates against often alter these frequencies . [SEP]
[CLS] ( see in ##har ##mon ##ici ##ty and stretched tuning for alterations specific to wire - string ##ed instruments and certain electric pianos . ) [SEP]
[CLS] however , those alterations are small , and except for precise , highly specialized tuning , it is reasonable to think of the frequencies of the harmonic series as integer multiple ##s of the fundamental frequency . [SEP]
[CLS] the harmonic series is an arithmetic series ( 1 ##× ##f , 2 ##× ##f , 3 ##× ##f , 4 ##× ##f , 5 ##× ##f , . . . ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in terms of frequency ( measured in cycles per second , or her ##tz ( hz ) where f is the fundamental frequency ) , the difference between consecutive harmonic ##s is therefore constant and equal to the fundamental . [SEP]
[CLS] but because human ears respond to sound nonlinear ##ly , higher harmonic ##s are perceived as " closer together " than lower ones . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , the octave series is a geometric progression ( 2 ##× ##f , 4 ##× ##f , 8 ##× ##f , 16 ##× ##f , . . . ) , and people hear these distances as " the same " in the sense of musical interval . [SEP]
[CLS] in terms of what one hears , each octave in the harmonic series is divided into increasingly " smaller " and more numerous intervals . [SEP]
[CLS] the second harmonic , whose frequency is twice of the fundamental , sounds an octave higher ; the third harmonic , three times the frequency of the fundamental , sounds a perfect fifth above the second harmonic . [SEP]
[CLS] the fourth harmonic vi ##brates at four times the frequency of the fundamental and sounds a perfect fourth above the third harmonic ( two octave ##s above the fundamental ) . [SEP]
[CLS] double the harmonic number means double the frequency ( which sounds an octave higher ) . [SEP]
[CLS] as mer ##sen ##ne says , " the order of the con ##son ##ances is natural , and . . . the way we count them , starting from unity up to the number six and beyond is founded in nature . " [SEP]
[CLS] if the harmonic ##s are octave displaced and compressed into the span of one octave , some of them are approximate ##d by the notes of what the west has adopted as the ch ##romatic scale based on the fundamental tone . [SEP]
[CLS] the western ch ##romatic scale has been modified into twelve equal semi ##tones , which is slightly out of tune with many of the harmonic ##s , especially the 7th , 11th , and 13th harmonic ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late 1930s , composer paul hind ##emi ##th ranked musical intervals according to their relative di ##sson ##ance based on these and similar harmonic relationships . [SEP]
[CLS] below is a comparison between the first 31 harmonic ##s and the intervals of 12 - tone equal temperament ( 12 ##tet ) , octave displaced and compressed into the span of one octave . [SEP]
[CLS] tinted fields highlight differences greater than 5 cents ( 1 / 20th of a semi ##tone ) , which is the human ear ' s " just noticeable difference " for notes played one after the other ( smaller differences are noticeable with notes played simultaneously ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the frequencies of the harmonic series , being integer multiple ##s of the fundamental frequency , are naturally related to each other by whole - numbered ratios and small whole - numbered ratios are likely the basis of the con ##son ##ance of musical intervals ( see just into ##nation ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this objective structure is augmented by psycho ##aco ##ust ##ic phenomena . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , a perfect fifth , say 200 and 300 hz ( cycles per second ) , causes a listener to perceive a combination tone of 100 hz ( the difference between 300 hz and 200 hz ) ; that is , an octave below the lower ( actual sounding ) note . [SEP]
[CLS] this 100 hz first - order combination tone then interact ##s with both notes of the interval to produce second - order combination tones of 200 ( 300 – 100 ) and 100 ( 200 – 100 ) hz and all further nt ##h - order combination tones are all the same , being formed from various sub ##tra ##ction of 100 , 200 , and 300 . [SEP]
[CLS] when one contrasts this with a di ##sson ##ant interval such as a tri ##tone ( not tempered ) with a frequency ratio of 7 : 5 one gets , for example , 700 – 500 = 200 ( 1st order combination tone ) and 500 – 200 = 300 ( 2nd order ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the rest of the combination tones are octave ##s of 100 hz so the 7 : 5 interval actually contains 4 notes : 100 hz ( and its octave ##s ) , 300 hz , 500 hz and 700 hz . [SEP]
[CLS] note that the lowest combination tone ( 100 hz ) is a 17th ( 2 octave ##s and a major third ) below the lower ( actual sounding ) note of the tri ##tone . [SEP]
[CLS] all the intervals su ##cc ##umb to similar analysis as has been demonstrated by paul hind ##emi ##th in his book " the craft of musical composition " , although he rejected the use of harmonic ##s from the 7th and beyond . [SEP]
[CLS] the mix ##ol ##yd ##ian mode is consonant with the first 10 harmonic ##s of the harmonic series ( the 11th harmonic , a tri ##tone , is not in the mix ##ol ##yd ##ian mode ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the ion ##ian mode is consonant with only the first 6 harmonic ##s of the series ( the 7th harmonic , a minor seventh , is not in the ion ##ian mode ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the relative amplitude ##s ( strengths ) of the various harmonic ##s primarily determine the tim ##bre of different instruments and sounds , though onset transient ##s , form ##ants , noises , and in ##har ##mon ##ici ##ties also play a role . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the clarinet and saxophone have similar mouth ##piece ##s and reed ##s , and both produce sound through resonance of air inside a chamber whose mouth ##piece end is considered closed . [SEP]
[CLS] because the clarinet ' s res ##ona ##tor is cylindrical , the even - numbered harmonic ##s are less present . [SEP]
[CLS] the saxophone ' s res ##ona ##tor is conical , which allows the even - numbered harmonic ##s to sound more strongly and thus produces a more complex tone . [SEP]
[CLS] the in ##har ##mon ##ic ringing of the instrument ' s metal res ##ona ##tor is even more prominent in the sounds of brass instruments . [SEP]
[CLS] human ears tend to group phase - coherent , harmonica ##lly - related frequency components into a single sensation . [SEP]
[CLS] rather than per ##ce ##iving the individual partial ##s – harmonic and in ##har ##mon ##ic , of a musical tone , humans perceive them together as a tone color or tim ##bre , and the overall pitch is heard as the fundamental of the harmonic series being experienced . [SEP]
[CLS] if a sound is heard that is made up of even just a few simultaneous sin ##e tones , and if the intervals among those tones form part of a harmonic series , the brain tends to group this input into a sensation of the pitch of the fundamental of that series , even if the fundamental is not present . [SEP]
[CLS] variations in the frequency of harmonic ##s can also affect the " perceived " fundamental pitch . [SEP]
[CLS] these variations , most clearly documented in the piano and other string ##ed instruments but also apparent in brass instruments , are caused by a combination of metal stiff ##ness and the interaction of the vibrating air or string with the res ##ona ##ting body of the instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] david cope ( 1997 ) suggests the concept of interval strength , in which an interval ' s strength , con ##son ##ance , or stability ( see con ##son ##ance and di ##sson ##ance ) is determined by its approximation to a lower and stronger , or higher and weaker , position in the harmonic series . [SEP]
[CLS] see also : lip ##ps – meyer law . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , an equal - tempered perfect fifth is stronger than an equal - tempered minor third , since they approximate a just perfect fifth and just minor third , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] the just minor third appears between harmonic ##s 5 and 6 while the just fifth appears lower , between harmonic ##s 2 and 3 . [SEP]
