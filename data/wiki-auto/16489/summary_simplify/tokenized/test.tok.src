[CLS] the author of more than 30 books , including " powers of horror " , " tales of love " , " black sun : depression and mel ##an ##cho ##lia " , " pro ##ust and the sense of time " , and the trilogy " female genius " , she has been awarded commander of the legion of honor , commander of the order of merit , the ho ##lberg international memorial prize , the hannah aren ##dt prize , and the vision 97 foundation prize , awarded by the have ##l foundation . [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##te ##va went on to study at the university of sofia , and while a postgraduate there obtained a research fellowship that enabled her to move to france in december 1965 , when she was 24 . [SEP]
[CLS] after joining the ' tel que ##l group ' founded by sol ##lers , kris ##te ##va focused on the politics of language and became an active member of the group . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , her view of the subject , and its construction , shares similarities with si ##gm ##und freud and lac ##an . [SEP]
[CLS] however , kris ##te ##va rejects any understanding of the subject in a structural ##ist sense ; instead , she favors a subject always " in process " or " on trial " . [SEP]
[CLS] in this way , she contributes to the posts ##truct ##ural ##ist critique of essential ##ized structures , whilst preserving the teachings of psycho ##analysis . [SEP]
[CLS] one of kris ##te ##va ' s most important contributions is that sign ##ification is composed of two elements , the symbolic and the " semi ##otic " , the latter being distinct from the discipline of semi ##otic ##s founded by ferdinand de sa ##uss ##ure . [SEP]
[CLS] as explained by augustine peru ##mal ##il , kris ##te ##va ' s " semi ##otic is closely related to the infant ##ile pre - o ##ed ##ip ##al referred to in the works of freud , otto rank , melanie klein , british object relation psycho ##analysis , and lac ##an ' s pre - mirror stage . [SEP]
[CLS] it is an emotional field , tied to the instincts , which dwell ##s in the fis ##sure ##s and pro ##so ##dy of language rather than in the den ##ota ##tive meanings of words . " [SEP]
[CLS] upon entering the mirror stage , the child learns to distinguish between self and other , and enters the realm of shared cultural meaning , known as the symbolic . [SEP]
[CLS] in " desire in language " ( 1980 ) , kris ##te ##va describes the symbolic as the space in which the development of language allows the child to become a " speaking subject , " and to develop a sense of identity separate from the mother . [SEP]
[CLS] this process of separation is known as ab ##ject ##ion , whereby the child must reject and move away from the mother in order to enter into the world of language , culture , meaning , and the social . [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##te ##va depart ##s from lac ##an in the idea that even after entering the symbolic , the subject continues to os ##ci ##lla ##te between the semi ##otic and the symbolic . [SEP]
[CLS] this continued identification with the mother may result in what kris ##te ##va refers to in " black sun " ( 1989 ) as mel ##an ##cho ##lia ( depression ) , given that female children simultaneously reject and identify with the mother figure . [SEP]
[CLS] it has also been suggested ( e . g . , creed , 1993 ) that the degradation of women and women ' s bodies in popular culture ( and particularly , for example , in slash ##er films ) emerges because of the threat to identity that the mother ' s body poses : it is a reminder of time spent in the und ##iff ##ere ##nti ##ated state of the semi ##otic , where one has no concept of self or identity . [SEP]
[CLS] after ab ##ject ##ing the mother , subjects retain an unconscious fascination with the semi ##otic , des ##iring to reunite with the mother , while at the same time fearing the loss of identity that acc ##omp ##anies it . [SEP]
[CLS] slash ##er films thus provide a way for audience members to safely re ##ena ##ct the process of ab ##ject ##ion by vicar ##iously ex ##pel ##ling and destroying the mother figure . [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##te ##va ' s idea of the " cho ##ra " has been interpreted in several ways : as a reference to the ut ##erus , as a metaphor for the relationship between the mother and child , and as the temporal period preceding the mirror stage . [SEP]
[CLS] in her essay " mother ##hood according to giovanni bell ##ini " from " desire in language " ( 1980 ) , kris ##te ##va refers to the " cho ##ra " as a " non - expressive total ##ity formed by drives and their st ##ase ##s in a mo ##tility that is full of movement as it is regulated . " [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##te ##va is also noted for her work on the concept of inter ##text ##ual ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##te ##va argues that anthropology and psychology , or the connection between the social and the subject , do not represent each other , but rather follow the same logic : the survival of the group and the subject . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , in her analysis of o ##ed ##ip ##us , she claims that the speaking subject cannot exist on his / her own , but that he / she " stands on the fragile threshold as if stranded on account of an impossible dem ##ar ##cation " ( " powers of horror " , p . 85 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in her comparison between the two disciplines , kris ##te ##va claims that the way in which an individual exclude ##s the ab ##ject mother as a means of forming an identity , is the same way in which societies are constructed . [SEP]
[CLS] on a broader scale , cultures exclude the maternal and the feminine , and by this come into being . [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##te ##va has been regarded as a key proponent of french feminism together with simone de beau ##vo ##ir , helene ci ##x ##ous , and luce ir ##iga ##ray . [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##te ##va has had a remarkable influence on feminism and feminist literary studies in the us and the uk , as well as on readings into contemporary art although her relation to feminist circles and movements in france has been quite controversial . [SEP]
[CLS] kris ##te ##va made a famous di ##sam ##bi ##gua ##tion of three types of feminism in " women ' s time " in " new mala ##dies of the soul " ( 1993 ) ; while rejecting the first two types , including that of beau ##vo ##ir , her stands are sometimes considered rejecting feminism altogether . [SEP]
[CLS] language should also be viewed through the prism ##s of history and of individual psychic and sexual experiences . [SEP]
[CLS] while the books maintain narrative suspense and develop a stylized surface , her readers also encounter ideas intrinsic to her theoretical projects . [SEP]
[CLS] her fictional o ##eu ##vre , which includes " the old man and the wolves " , " murder in by ##zan ##tium " , and " possessions " , while often all ##egorical , also approaches the autobiographical in some passages , especially with one of the protagonists of " possessions " , stephanie del ##aco ##ur — a french journalist — who can be seen as kris ##te ##va ' s alter ego . [SEP]
[CLS] for her " innovative exploration ##s of questions on the intersection of language , culture and literature " , kris ##te ##va was awarded the ho ##lberg international memorial prize in 2004 . [SEP]
[CLS] she has also been awarded commander of the legion of honor , commander of the order of merit , and the va ##cl ##av have ##l prize . [SEP]
[CLS] roman jakob ##son said that " both readers and listeners , whether agreeing or in stubborn disagreement with julia kris ##te ##va , feel indeed attracted to her con ##tag ##ious voice and to her genuine gift of questioning generally adopted ' ax ##ioms , ' and her contrary gift of releasing various ' damned questions ' from their traditional question marks . " [SEP]
[CLS] roland bart ##hes comments that " julia kris ##te ##va changes the place of things : she always destroys the last prejudice , the one you thought you could be reassured by , could be take sic pride in ; what she di ##sp ##lace ##s is the already - said , the de ##ja - di ##t , i . e . , the instance of the sign ##ified , i . e . , stupidity ; what she sub ##vert ##s is authority - the authority of mono ##logic science , of fi ##lia ##tion . " [SEP]
[CLS] he cites gay ##at ##ri sp ##iva ##k ' s conclusion that kris ##te ##va ' s book " about chinese women " " belongs to that very eighteenth century that kris ##te ##va sc ##orn ##s " after pin ##point ##ing " the brief , expansive , often completely un ##ground ##ed way in which she writes about two thousand years of a culture she is unfamiliar with " . [SEP]
[CLS] almond notes the absence of so ##phi ##stic ##ation in kris ##te ##va ' s remarks concerning the muslim world and the dismiss ##ive terminology she uses to describe its culture and believers . [SEP]
[CLS] he critic ##izes kris ##te ##va ' s opposition which ju ##xt ##ap ##oses " islamic societies " against " demo ##cr ##acies where life is still fairly pleasant " by pointing out that kris ##te ##va displays no awareness of the complex and nu ##ance ##d debate ongoing among women theorists in the muslim world , and that she does not refer to anything other than the rush ##die fat ##wa in dismissing the entire muslim faith as " reaction ##ary and per ##se ##cut ##ory " . [SEP]
[CLS] in " intellectual imp ##ost ##ures " ( 1997 ) , physics professors alan so ##kal and jean br ##ic ##mont devote a chapter to kris ##te ##va ' s use of mathematics in her writings . [SEP]
[CLS] they argue that kris ##te ##va fails to show the relevance of the mathematical concepts she discusses to linguistics and the other fields she studies , and that no such relevance exists . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2018 , bulgaria ' s state dos ##sier commission announced that kris ##te ##va had been an agent for the committee for state security under the code name " sa ##bina " . [SEP]
[CLS] on 30 march , the state dos ##sier commission began publishing online the entire set of documents reflecting kris ##te ##va ' s activity as an informant of the former committee for state security . [SEP]
[CLS] after settling in paris in 1965 , she was cornered by bulgarian sp ##ook ##s who pointed out to her that she still had a vulnerable family in the home country . [SEP]
[CLS] so she agreed to regular meetings over many years , in the course of which she seems to have told her handler ##s nothing more than gossip about aragon , bat ##ail ##le & co . from the left bank cafes – stuff they could have read in " le can ##ard en ##chai ##ne " . . . the combined intelligence value of its product and her reports was almost zero . [SEP]
[CLS] but never mind : they could impress their boss by showing him a real international ce ##le ##b on their books . . . " [SEP]
