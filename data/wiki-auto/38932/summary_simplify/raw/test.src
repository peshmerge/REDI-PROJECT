Born in West Africa, she was sold into slavery at the age of seven or eight and transported to North America.
She was purchased by the Wheatley family of Boston, who taught her to read and write and encouraged her poetry when they saw her talent.
The publication of her "Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral" on September 1, 1773, brought her fame both in England and the American colonies.
During Wheatley's visit to England with her master's son, African-American poet Jupiter Hammon praised her work in his own poem.
After her husband was imprisoned for debt in 1784, Wheatley fell into poverty and died of illness, quickly followed by the death of her surviving infant son.
Although the date and place of her birth are not documented, scholars believe that Phillis Wheatley was born in 1753 in West Africa, most likely in present-day Gambia or Senegal.
On arrival she was re-sold to the wealthy Boston merchant and tailor John Wheatley, who bought the young girl as a servant for his wife Susanna.
John Wheatley was known as a progressive throughout New England; his family gave Phillis an unprecedented education for an enslaved person, and for a female of any race.
At the age of 14, she wrote her first poem, "To the University of Cambridge, in New England."
Recognizing her literary ability, the Wheatley family supported Phillis's education and left the household labor to their other domestic slaves.
Strongly influenced by her studies of the works of Alexander Pope, John Milton, Homer, Horace and Virgil, Phillis began to write poetry.
In 1773, at the age of 20, Phillis accompanied Nathaniel Wheatley to London in part for her health, but also because Susanna believed she would have a better chance publishing her book of poems there.
She had an audience with the Lord Mayor of London (an audience with George III was arranged, but Phillis returned home beforehand), as well as with other significant members of British society.
She was also never able to personally meet Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, who served as the patron of Wheatley's volume of poems, which was published in the summer of 1773.
Phillis Wheatley wrote a letter to Reverend Samson Occom, commending him on his ideas and beliefs of how the slaves should be given their natural born rights in America.
Along with her poetry, she was able to express her thoughts, comments and concerns to others.
In 1773, sometime between July and October, Wheatley was emancipated by the Wheatley family shortly after her book, "Poems on Subjects Religious and Moral", was published in London.
They struggled with poor living conditions and the deaths of two babies.
In 1779, Wheatley submitted a proposal for a second volume of poems, but was unable to publish it because of her financial circumstances, the loss of patrons after her emancipation (often publication of books was based on gaining subscriptions for guaranteed sales beforehand), and the Revolutionary War.
Her husband John Peters was improvident, and imprisoned for debt in 1784, leaving an impoverished Wheatley with a sickly infant son.
She went to work as a scullery maid at a boarding house to support them, a kind of domestic labor that she had not been accustomed to, even before becoming a free person.
In 1768, Wheatley wrote "To the King's Most Excellent Majesty", in which she praised King George III for repealing the Stamp Act.
As the American Revolution gained strength, Wheatley's writing turned to themes that expressed ideas of the rebellious colonists.
But, in another poem, she wrote that slavery was a cruel fate.
They concluded she had written the poems ascribed to her and signed an attestation, which was included in the preface of her book of collected works: "Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral," published in London in 1773.
Publishers in Boston had declined to publish it, but her work was of great interest in London.
There, Selina, Countess of Huntingdon and the Earl of Dartmouth acted as patrons to help Wheatley gain publication.
Her poetry received comment in "The London Magazine" in 1773, which published as a "specimen" of her work her poem 'Hymn to the Morning', and said: "these poems display no astonishing works of genius, but when we consider them as the productions of a young, untutored African, who wrote them after six months careful study of the English language, we cannot but suppress our admiration for talents so vigorous and lively."
In 1778, the African-American poet Jupiter Hammon wrote an ode to Wheatley ("An Address to Miss Phillis Wheatley"), while his owner, Lloyd, had temporarily moved himself and the slaves he owned to Hartford, Connecticut, during the Revolutionary War.
Hammon saw Wheatley as having succumbed to what he believed were pagan influences in her writing, and so the "Address" consisted of 21 rhyming quatrains, each accompanied by a related Bible verse, that he thought would compel Wheatley to return to a Christian path in life.
Boston-based publisher and abolitionist Isaac Knapp collected Wheatley's poetry along with that of enslaved North Carolina poet George Moses Horton in 1838 under the title "Memoir and Poems of Phillis Wheatley, A Native African and a Slave.
The memoir was earlier published in 1834 by Geo W. Light, but did not include poems by Horton.
John C. Shields, noting that her poetry did not simply reflect the literature she read but was based on her personal ideas and beliefs.
writes,: "Wheatley had more in mind than simple conformity.
It will be shown later that her allusions to the sun god and to the goddess of the morn, always appearing as they do here in close association with her quest for poetic inspiration, are of central importance to her."
This poem is arranged into three stanzas of four lines in iambic tetrameter followed by a concluding couplet in iambic pentameter.
He notes that Sun is a homonym for Son, and that Wheatley intended a double reference to Christ.
Wheatley also refers to "heav'nly muse" in two of her poems: "To a Clergy Man on the Death of his Lady" and "Isaiah LXIII," signifying her idea of the Christian deity.
Shields believes that her use of classicism set her work apart from that of her contemporaries: "Wheatley's use of classicism distinguishes her work as original and unique and deserves extended treatment."
Shields sums up her writing as being "contemplative and reflective rather than brilliant and shimmering."
Voltaire stated in a letter to a friend that Wheatley had proved that black people could write poetry.
John Paul Jones asked a fellow officer to deliver some of his personal writings to "Phillis the African favorite of the Nine (muses) and Apollo."
She was honored by many of America's founding fathers, including George Washington, who told her that "the style and manner of your poetry exhibit a striking proof of your great poetical Talents."
She is commemorated on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.
The Phyllis Wheatley YWCA in Washington, D.C. and the Phyllis Wheatly High School in Houston, Texas, are named for her, as was the historic Phyllis Wheatley School in Jensen Beach, Florida, now the oldest building on the campus of American Legion Post 126, (Jensen Beach, Florida).
Bell Booksellers published Wheatley's first book in September 1773 (8 Aldgate, now the site of the Dorsett City Hotel), the unveiling took place of a blue plaque honoring her, organized by the Nubian Jak Community Trust and Black History Walks was unveiled in London.
