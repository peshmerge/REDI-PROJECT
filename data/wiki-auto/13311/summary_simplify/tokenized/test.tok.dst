[CLS] a hormone ( from the greek part ##ici ##ple , " setting in motion " ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules , produced by glands in multi ##cellular organisms , that are transported by the ci ##rc ##ulator ##y system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " hormone " is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell ( auto ##cr ##ine or intra ##cr ##ine signaling ) or nearby cells ( para ##cr ##ine signalling ) . [SEP]
[CLS] hormones affect distant cells by binding to specific receptor proteins in the target cell , resulting in a change in cell function . [SEP]
[CLS] when a hormone binds to the receptor , it results in the activation of a signal trans ##duction pathway that typically activate ##s gene transcription , resulting in increased expression of target proteins ; non - gen ##omic effects are more rapid , and can be syn ##er ##gist ##ic with gen ##omic effects . [SEP]
[CLS] amino acid – based hormones ( amin ##es and peptide or protein hormones ) are water - soluble and act on the surface of target cells via second messengers ; ste ##roid hormones , being lip ##id - soluble , move through the plasma membranes of target cells ( both cy ##top ##las ##mic and nuclear ) to act within their nuclei . [SEP]
[CLS] end ##oc ##rine glands provide the cardinal example , but specialized cells in various other organs also secret ##e hormones . [SEP]
[CLS] hormone secret ##ion occurs in response to specific bio ##chemical signals from a wide range of regulatory systems . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , serum calcium concentration affects para ##thy ##roid hormone synthesis ; blood sugar ( serum glucose concentration ) affects insulin synthesis ; and because the outputs of the stomach and ex ##oc ##rine pan ##cre ##as ( the amounts of gas ##tric juice and pan ##cre ##atic juice ) become the input of the small int ##est ##ine , the small int ##est ##ine secret ##es hormones to stimulate or inhibit the stomach and pan ##cre ##as based on how busy it is . [SEP]
[CLS] upon secret ##ion , certain hormones , including protein hormones and cat ##ech ##ola ##mine ##s , are water - soluble and are thus readily transported through the ci ##rc ##ulator ##y system . [SEP]
[CLS] other hormones , including ste ##roid and thyroid hormones , are lip ##id - soluble ; to achieve widespread distribution , these hormones must bond to carrier plasma g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s ( e . g . , thy ##ro ##xin ##e - binding g ##lo ##bu ##lin ( tb ##g ) ) to form ligand - protein complexes . [SEP]
[CLS] some hormones are completely active when released into the blood ##stream ( as is the case for insulin and growth hormones ) , while others are pro ##hor ##mon ##es that must be activated in specific cells through a series of activation steps that are commonly highly regulated . [SEP]
[CLS] the end ##oc ##rine system secret ##es hormones directly into the blood ##stream , typically via fen ##estra ##ted cap ##illa ##ries , whereas the ex ##oc ##rine system secret ##es its hormones indirectly using duct ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] hormones with para ##cr ##ine function diffuse through the inter ##sti ##tial spaces to nearby target tissue . [SEP]
[CLS] hormone producing cells are typically of a specialized cell type , residing within a particular end ##oc ##rine gland , such as the thyroid gland , o ##var ##ies , and test ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] hormones exit their cell of origin via ex ##oc ##yt ##osis or another means of membrane transport . [SEP]
[CLS] cellular recipients of a particular ho ##rm ##onal signal may be one of several cell types that reside within a number of different tissues , as is the case for insulin , which triggers a diverse range of systemic physiological effects . [SEP]
[CLS] the discovery of hormones and end ##oc ##rine signaling occurred during studies of how the digest ##ive system regulates its activities , as explained at secret ##in § discovery . [SEP]
[CLS] he kept a group of rooster ##s with their test ##es intact , and saw that they had normal sized watt ##les and comb ##s ( secondary sexual organs ) , a normal crow , and normal sexual and aggressive behaviors . [SEP]
[CLS] he also had a group with their test ##es surgical ##ly removed , and noticed that their secondary sexual organs were decreased in size , had a weak crow , did not have sexual attraction towards females , and were not aggressive . [SEP]
[CLS] to test this further , he removed one test ##is and placed it in the abdominal cavity . [SEP]
[CLS] berth ##old determined that the location or genetic factors of the test ##es do not matter in relation to sexual organs and behaviors , but that some chemical in the test ##es being secret ##ed is causing this phenomenon . [SEP]
[CLS] they cut the nerves to the pan ##cre ##as in an animal model and discovered that it was not nerve impulse ##s that controlled secret ##ion from the pan ##cre ##as . [SEP]
[CLS] it was determined that a factor secret ##ed from the int ##est ##ines into the blood ##stream was stimulating the pan ##cre ##as to secret ##e digest ##ive fluids . [SEP]
[CLS] this factor was named secret ##in : a hormone , although the term hormone was not coined until 1905 by star ##ling . [SEP]
[CLS] a cell may have several different receptor types that recognize the same hormone but activate different signal trans ##duction pathways , or a cell may have several different receptors that recognize different hormones and activate the same bio ##chemical pathway . [SEP]
[CLS] receptors for most peptide as well as many e ##ico ##san ##oid hormones are embedded in the plasma membrane at the surface of the cell and the majority of these receptors belong to the g protein - coupled receptor ( gp ##cr ) class of seven alpha helix trans ##me ##mb ##rane proteins . [SEP]
[CLS] the interaction of hormone and receptor typically triggers a cascade of secondary effects within the cy ##top ##las ##m of the cell , described as signal trans ##duction , often involving ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation or de ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of various other cy ##top ##las ##mic proteins , changes in ion channel per ##me ##ability , or increased concentrations of intra ##cellular molecules that may act as secondary messengers ( e . g . , cyclic amp ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some protein hormones also interact with intra ##cellular receptors located in the cy ##top ##las ##m or nucleus by an intra ##cr ##ine mechanism . [SEP]
[CLS] to bind their receptors , these hormones must first cross the cell membrane . [SEP]
[CLS] the combined hormone - receptor complex then moves across the nuclear membrane into the nucleus of the cell , where it binds to specific dna sequences , regulating the expression of certain genes , and thereby increasing the levels of the proteins encoded by these genes . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it has been shown that not all ste ##roid receptors are located inside the cell . [SEP]
[CLS] a hormone may also regulate the production and release of other hormones . [SEP]
[CLS] the rate of hormone bio ##sy ##nt ##hesis and secret ##ion is often regulated by a home ##osta ##tic negative feedback control mechanism . [SEP]
[CLS] such a mechanism depends on factors that influence the metabolism and ex ##cre ##tion of hormones . [SEP]
[CLS] one special group of hormones is the tr ##op ##ic hormones that stimulate the hormone production of other end ##oc ##rine glands . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , thyroid - stimulating hormone ( ts ##h ) causes growth and increased activity of another end ##oc ##rine gland , the thyroid , which increases output of thyroid hormones . [SEP]
[CLS] to release active hormones quickly into the circulation , hormone bio ##sy ##nt ##hetic cells may produce and store biological ##ly inactive hormones in the form of pre - or pro ##hor ##mon ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] these can then be quickly converted into their active hormone form in response to a particular stimulus . [SEP]
[CLS] they also have a rapid degradation cycle , making sure they do not reach distant sites within the body . [SEP]
[CLS] local preparations for use in ot ##olar ##yn ##gol ##ogy often contain ph ##arm ##aco ##logic equivalent ##s of adrenaline , while ste ##roid and vitamin d cream ##s are used extensively in der ##mat ##ological practice . [SEP]
[CLS] the effects of ph ##arm ##aco ##logic doses of hormones may be different from responses to naturally occurring amounts and may be therapeutic ##ally useful , though not without potentially adverse side effects . [SEP]
[CLS] at the neurological level , behavior can be in ##fer ##red based on : hormone concentrations ; hormone - release patterns ; the numbers and locations of hormone receptors ; and the efficiency of hormone receptors for those involved in gene transcription . [SEP]
[CLS] there are several benefits with the formation of a complex with a binding protein : the effective half - life of the bound hormone is increased ; a reservoir of bound hormones is created , which even ##s the variations in concentration of un ##bound hormones ( bound hormones will replace the un ##bound hormones when these are eliminated ) .
