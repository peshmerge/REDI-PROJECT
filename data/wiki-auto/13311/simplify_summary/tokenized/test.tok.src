[CLS] a hormone ( from the greek part ##ici ##ple , " setting in motion " ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules , produced by glands in multi ##cellular organisms , that are transported by the ci ##rc ##ulator ##y system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] the glands that secret ##e hormones comprise the end ##oc ##rine signaling - system . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " hormone " is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell ( auto ##cr ##ine or intra ##cr ##ine signaling ) or nearby cells ( para ##cr ##ine signalling ) . [SEP]
[CLS] hormones serve to communicate between organs and tissues for physiological regulation and behavioral activities such as digest ##ion , metabolism , res ##piration , tissue function , sensory perception , sleep , ex ##cre ##tion , lac ##tation , stress induction , growth and development , movement , reproduction , and mood manipulation . [SEP]
[CLS] hormones affect distant cells by binding to specific receptor proteins in the target cell , resulting in a change in cell function . [SEP]
[CLS] when a hormone binds to the receptor , it results in the activation of a signal trans ##duction pathway that typically activate ##s gene transcription , resulting in increased expression of target proteins ; non - gen ##omic effects are more rapid , and can be syn ##er ##gist ##ic with gen ##omic effects . [SEP]
[CLS] amino acid – based hormones ( amin ##es and peptide or protein hormones ) are water - soluble and act on the surface of target cells via second messengers ; ste ##roid hormones , being lip ##id - soluble , move through the plasma membranes of target cells ( both cy ##top ##las ##mic and nuclear ) to act within their nuclei . [SEP]
[CLS] hormone secret ##ion may occur in many tissues . [SEP]
[CLS] end ##oc ##rine glands provide the cardinal example , but specialized cells in various other organs also secret ##e hormones . [SEP]
[CLS] hormone secret ##ion occurs in response to specific bio ##chemical signals from a wide range of regulatory systems . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , serum calcium concentration affects para ##thy ##roid hormone synthesis ; blood sugar ( serum glucose concentration ) affects insulin synthesis ; and because the outputs of the stomach and ex ##oc ##rine pan ##cre ##as ( the amounts of gas ##tric juice and pan ##cre ##atic juice ) become the input of the small int ##est ##ine , the small int ##est ##ine secret ##es hormones to stimulate or inhibit the stomach and pan ##cre ##as based on how busy it is . [SEP]
[CLS] regulation of hormone synthesis of go ##nad ##al hormones , ad ##ren ##oco ##rti ##cal hormones , and thyroid hormones often depends on complex sets of direct - influence and feedback interactions involving the h ##yp ##oth ##ala ##mic - pit ##uit ##ary - ad ##ren ##al ( hp ##a ) , - go ##nad ##al ( hp ##g ) , and - thyroid ( hp ##t ) axes . [SEP]
[CLS] upon secret ##ion , certain hormones , including protein hormones and cat ##ech ##ola ##mine ##s , are water - soluble and are thus readily transported through the ci ##rc ##ulator ##y system . [SEP]
[CLS] other hormones , including ste ##roid and thyroid hormones , are lip ##id - soluble ; to achieve widespread distribution , these hormones must bond to carrier plasma g ##ly ##co ##pro ##tein ##s ( e . g . , thy ##ro ##xin ##e - binding g ##lo ##bu ##lin ( tb ##g ) ) to form ligand - protein complexes . [SEP]
[CLS] some hormones are completely active when released into the blood ##stream ( as is the case for insulin and growth hormones ) , while others are pro ##hor ##mon ##es that must be activated in specific cells through a series of activation steps that are commonly highly regulated . [SEP]
[CLS] the end ##oc ##rine system secret ##es hormones directly into the blood ##stream , typically via fen ##estra ##ted cap ##illa ##ries , whereas the ex ##oc ##rine system secret ##es its hormones indirectly using duct ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] hormones with para ##cr ##ine function diffuse through the inter ##sti ##tial spaces to nearby target tissue . [SEP]
[CLS] hormone producing cells are typically of a specialized cell type , residing within a particular end ##oc ##rine gland , such as the thyroid gland , o ##var ##ies , and test ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] hormones exit their cell of origin via ex ##oc ##yt ##osis or another means of membrane transport . [SEP]
[CLS] the hierarchical model is an overs ##im ##pl ##ification of the ho ##rm ##onal signaling process . [SEP]
[CLS] cellular recipients of a particular ho ##rm ##onal signal may be one of several cell types that reside within a number of different tissues , as is the case for insulin , which triggers a diverse range of systemic physiological effects . [SEP]
[CLS] different tissue types may also respond differently to the same ho ##rm ##onal signal . [SEP]
[CLS] the discovery of hormones and end ##oc ##rine signaling occurred during studies of how the digest ##ive system regulates its activities , as explained at secret ##in § discovery . [SEP]
[CLS] arnold adolph berth ##old was a german ph ##ys ##iol ##ogist and zoo ##logist , who , in 1849 , had a question about the function of the test ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] he noticed that in cast ##rated rooster ##s that they did not have the same sexual behaviors as rooster ##s with their test ##es intact . [SEP]
[CLS] he decided to run an experiment on male rooster ##s to examine this phenomenon . [SEP]
[CLS] he kept a group of rooster ##s with their test ##es intact , and saw that they had normal sized watt ##les and comb ##s ( secondary sexual organs ) , a normal crow , and normal sexual and aggressive behaviors . [SEP]
[CLS] he also had a group with their test ##es surgical ##ly removed , and noticed that their secondary sexual organs were decreased in size , had a weak crow , did not have sexual attraction towards females , and were not aggressive . [SEP]
[CLS] he realized that this organ was essential for these behaviors , but he did not know how . [SEP]
[CLS] to test this further , he removed one test ##is and placed it in the abdominal cavity . [SEP]
[CLS] the rooster ##s acted and had normal physical anatomy . [SEP]
[CLS] he was able to see that location of the test ##es do not matter . [SEP]
[CLS] he then wanted to see if it was a genetic factor that was involved in the test ##es that provided these functions . [SEP]
[CLS] he transplant ##ed a test ##is from another rooster to a rooster with one test ##is removed , and saw that they had normal behavior and physical anatomy as well . [SEP]
[CLS] berth ##old determined that the location or genetic factors of the test ##es do not matter in relation to sexual organs and behaviors , but that some chemical in the test ##es being secret ##ed is causing this phenomenon . [SEP]
[CLS] it was later identified that this factor was the hormone testosterone . [SEP]
[CLS] william bay ##lis ##s and ernest star ##ling , a ph ##ys ##iol ##ogist and biologist , respectively , wanted to see if the nervous system had an impact on the digest ##ive system . [SEP]
[CLS] they knew that the pan ##cre ##as was involved in the secret ##ion of digest ##ive fluids after the passage of food from the stomach to the int ##est ##ines , which they believed to be due to the nervous system . [SEP]
[CLS] they cut the nerves to the pan ##cre ##as in an animal model and discovered that it was not nerve impulse ##s that controlled secret ##ion from the pan ##cre ##as . [SEP]
[CLS] it was determined that a factor secret ##ed from the int ##est ##ines into the blood ##stream was stimulating the pan ##cre ##as to secret ##e digest ##ive fluids . [SEP]
[CLS] this factor was named secret ##in : a hormone , although the term hormone was not coined until 1905 by star ##ling . [SEP]
[CLS] ho ##rm ##onal effects are dependent on where they are released , as they can be released in different manners . [SEP]
[CLS] not all hormones are released from a cell and into the blood until it binds to a receptor on a target . [SEP]
[CLS] as hormones are defined functional ##ly , not structurally , they may have diverse chemical structures . [SEP]
[CLS] hormones occur in multi ##cellular organisms ( plants , animals , fungi , brown algae , and red algae ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these compounds occur also in un ##ice ##ll ##ular organisms , and may act as signaling molecules , but there is no consensus if , in this case , they can be called hormones . [SEP]
[CLS] compared with ve ##rte ##brates , insects and crust ##ace ##ans possess a number of structurally unusual hormones such as the juvenile hormone , a se ##s ##qui ##ter ##pen ##oid . [SEP]
[CLS] most hormones initiate a cellular response by initially binding to either cell membrane associated or intra ##cellular receptors . [SEP]
[CLS] a cell may have several different receptor types that recognize the same hormone but activate different signal trans ##duction pathways , or a cell may have several different receptors that recognize different hormones and activate the same bio ##chemical pathway . [SEP]
[CLS] receptors for most peptide as well as many e ##ico ##san ##oid hormones are embedded in the plasma membrane at the surface of the cell and the majority of these receptors belong to the g protein - coupled receptor ( gp ##cr ) class of seven alpha helix trans ##me ##mb ##rane proteins . [SEP]
[CLS] the interaction of hormone and receptor typically triggers a cascade of secondary effects within the cy ##top ##las ##m of the cell , described as signal trans ##duction , often involving ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation or de ##ph ##os ##ph ##ory ##lation of various other cy ##top ##las ##mic proteins , changes in ion channel per ##me ##ability , or increased concentrations of intra ##cellular molecules that may act as secondary messengers ( e . g . , cyclic amp ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some protein hormones also interact with intra ##cellular receptors located in the cy ##top ##las ##m or nucleus by an intra ##cr ##ine mechanism . [SEP]
[CLS] for ste ##roid or thyroid hormones , their receptors are located inside the cell within the cy ##top ##las ##m of the target cell . [SEP]
[CLS] these receptors belong to the nuclear receptor family of ligand - activated transcription factors . [SEP]
[CLS] to bind their receptors , these hormones must first cross the cell membrane . [SEP]
[CLS] they can do so because they are lip ##id - soluble . [SEP]
[CLS] the combined hormone - receptor complex then moves across the nuclear membrane into the nucleus of the cell , where it binds to specific dna sequences , regulating the expression of certain genes , and thereby increasing the levels of the proteins encoded by these genes . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it has been shown that not all ste ##roid receptors are located inside the cell . [SEP]
[CLS] some are associated with the plasma membrane . [SEP]
[CLS] a hormone may also regulate the production and release of other hormones . [SEP]
[CLS] hormone signals control the internal environment of the body through home ##osta ##sis . [SEP]
[CLS] the rate of hormone bio ##sy ##nt ##hesis and secret ##ion is often regulated by a home ##osta ##tic negative feedback control mechanism . [SEP]
[CLS] such a mechanism depends on factors that influence the metabolism and ex ##cre ##tion of hormones . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , higher hormone concentration alone cannot trigger the negative feedback mechanism . [SEP]
[CLS] negative feedback must be triggered by over ##pro ##duction of an " effect " of the hormone . [SEP]
[CLS] one special group of hormones is the tr ##op ##ic hormones that stimulate the hormone production of other end ##oc ##rine glands . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , thyroid - stimulating hormone ( ts ##h ) causes growth and increased activity of another end ##oc ##rine gland , the thyroid , which increases output of thyroid hormones . [SEP]
[CLS] to release active hormones quickly into the circulation , hormone bio ##sy ##nt ##hetic cells may produce and store biological ##ly inactive hormones in the form of pre - or pro ##hor ##mon ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] these can then be quickly converted into their active hormone form in response to a particular stimulus . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##ico ##san ##oids are considered to act as local hormones . [SEP]
[CLS] they are considered to be " local " because they possess specific effects on target cells close to their site of formation . [SEP]
[CLS] they also have a rapid degradation cycle , making sure they do not reach distant sites within the body . [SEP]
[CLS] many hormones and their structural and functional analog ##s are used as medication . [SEP]
[CLS] the most commonly prescribed hormones are est ##rogen ##s and pro ##ges ##to ##gens ( as methods of ho ##rm ##onal contra ##ception and as hr ##t ) , thy ##ro ##xin ##e ( as lev ##oth ##yr ##ox ##ine , for h ##yp ##oth ##yr ##oid ##ism ) and ste ##roids ( for auto ##im ##mun ##e diseases and several respiratory disorders ) . [SEP]
[CLS] insulin is used by many dia ##bet ##ics . [SEP]
[CLS] local preparations for use in ot ##olar ##yn ##gol ##ogy often contain ph ##arm ##aco ##logic equivalent ##s of adrenaline , while ste ##roid and vitamin d cream ##s are used extensively in der ##mat ##ological practice . [SEP]
[CLS] a " ph ##arm ##aco ##logic dose " or " su ##pr ##ap ##hy ##sio ##logical dose " of a hormone is a medical usage referring to an amount of a hormone far greater than naturally occurs in a healthy body . [SEP]
[CLS] the effects of ph ##arm ##aco ##logic doses of hormones may be different from responses to naturally occurring amounts and may be therapeutic ##ally useful , though not without potentially adverse side effects . [SEP]
[CLS] an example is the ability of ph ##arm ##aco ##logic doses of g ##lu ##co ##cor ##tic ##oids to suppress inflammation . [SEP]
[CLS] at the neurological level , behavior can be in ##fer ##red based on : hormone concentrations ; hormone - release patterns ; the numbers and locations of hormone receptors ; and the efficiency of hormone receptors for those involved in gene transcription . [SEP]
[CLS] not only do hormones influence behavior , but also behavior and the environment influence hormones . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , a feedback loop is formed . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , behavior can affect hormones , which in turn can affect behavior , which in turn can affect hormones , and so on . [SEP]
[CLS] hormone transport and the involvement of binding proteins is an essential aspect when considering the function of hormones . [SEP]
[CLS] there are several benefits with the formation of a complex with a binding protein : the effective half - life of the bound hormone is increased ; a reservoir of bound hormones is created , which even ##s the variations in concentration of un ##bound hormones ( bound hormones will replace the un ##bound hormones when these are eliminated ) .
