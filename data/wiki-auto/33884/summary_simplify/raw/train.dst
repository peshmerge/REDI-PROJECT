The festival has become widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history, as well as a defining event for the "counterculture generation".
The event's significance was reinforced by a 1970 documentary film, an accompanying , and a song written by Joni Mitchell that became major hits for Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and Matthews Southern Comfort.
In 2017, the festival site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Woodstock was initiated through the efforts of Michael Lang, Artie Kornfeld, Joel Rosenman, and John P. Roberts.
Lang had some experience as a promoter, having co-organized the Miami Pop Festival on the East Coast the prior year, where an estimated 25,000 people attended the two-day event.
Early in 1969, Roberts and Rosenman were New York City entrepreneurs, in the process of building Media Sound, a large audio recording studio complex in Manhattan.
Lang and Kornfeld's lawyer, Miles Lourie, who had done legal work on the Media Sound project, suggested that they contact Roberts and Rosenman about financing a similar, but much smaller, studio Kornfeld and Lang hoped to build in Woodstock, New York.
Unpersuaded by this Studio-in-the-Woods proposal, Roberts and Rosenman counter-proposed a concert featuring the kind of artists known to frequent the Woodstock area (such as Bob Dylan and The Band).
Kornfeld and Lang agreed to the new plan, and Woodstock Ventures was formed in January 1969.
The company offices were located in an oddly decorated floor of 47 West 57th Street in Manhattan.
From the start, there were differences in approach among the four: Roberts was disciplined and knew what was needed for the venture to succeed, while the laid-back Lang saw Woodstock as a new, "relaxed" way of bringing entrepreneurs together.
When Lang was unable to find a site for the concert, Roberts and Rosenman, growing increasingly concerned, took to the road and eventually came up with a venue.
Similar differences about financial discipline made Roberts and Rosenman wonder whether to pull the plug or to continue pumping money into the project.
In April 1969, Creedence Clearwater Revival became the first act to sign a contract for the event, agreeing to play for $10,000 (equivalent to $ in ) .
It became a "free concert" only after the event drew hundreds of thousands more people than the organizers had prepared for.
Ticket sales were limited to record stores in the greater New York City area, or by mail via a post office box at the Radio City Station Post Office located in Midtown Manhattan.
The original venue plan was for the festival to take place in Wallkill, New York, possibly near the proposed recording studio site owned by Alexander Tapooz.
After local residents quickly shot down that idea, Lang and Kornfeld thought they had found another possible location in Saugerties, New York.
But they had misunderstood, as the landowner's attorney made clear, in a brief meeting with Roberts and Rosenman.
Growing alarmed at the lack of progress, Roberts and Rosenman took over the search for a venue, and discovered the 300 acre Mills Industrial Park in the town of Wallkill, New York, which Woodstock Ventures leased for $10,000 (equivalent to $ today) in the Spring of 1969.
In early July, the Town Board passed a law requiring a permit for any gathering over 5,000 people.
Reports of the ban, however, turned out to be a publicity bonanza for the festival.
In his 2007 book "Taking Woodstock", Elliot Tiber relates that he offered to host the event on his 15 acre motel grounds, and had a permit for such an event.
Stop Max's Hippy Music Festival", Bethel Town Attorney Frederick W. V. Schadt, building inspector Donald Clark and Town Supervisor Daniel Amatucci approved the festival permits, but the Bethel Town Board refused to issue the permits formally.
Subsequently, on August 2, 1969, the Building Inspector informed Woodstock Ventures, Inc. that the Stop Work Order was lifted, and the festival could proceed pending backing by the Department of Health and Agriculture, and removal of all structures by September 1, 1969.
At a meeting three days before the event, organizers felt they had two options: one was to complete the fencing and ticket booths, without which the promoters would lose any profit or go into debt; the other option involved putting their remaining available resources into building the stage, without which the promoters feared they would have a disappointed and disgruntled audience.
Those without tickets simply walked through gaps in the fences, and the organizers were forced to make the event free of charge.
Though the festival left its promoters nearly bankrupt, their ownership of the film and recording rights more than compensated for the losses after the release of the hit documentary film "Woodstock" in March 1970.
The influx of attenders to the rural concert site in Bethel created a massive traffic jam.
The town of Bethel did not enforce its codes, fearing chaos as the crowd flowed to the site.
