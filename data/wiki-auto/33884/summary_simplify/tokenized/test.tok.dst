[CLS] the festival has become widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history , as well as a defining event for the " counter ##culture generation " . [SEP]
[CLS] the event ' s significance was reinforced by a 1970 documentary film , an accompanying , and a song written by jon ##i mitchell that became major hits for crosby , stills , nash & young and matthews southern comfort . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2017 , the festival site was listed on the national register of historic places . [SEP]
[CLS] woodstock was initiated through the efforts of michael lang , art ##ie ko ##rn ##feld , joel rosen ##man , and john p . roberts . [SEP]
[CLS] lang had some experience as a promoter , having co - organized the miami pop festival on the east coast the prior year , where an estimated 25 , 000 people attended the two - day event . [SEP]
[CLS] early in 1969 , roberts and rosen ##man were new york city entrepreneurs , in the process of building media sound , a large audio recording studio complex in manhattan . [SEP]
[CLS] lang and ko ##rn ##feld ' s lawyer , miles lou ##rie , who had done legal work on the media sound project , suggested that they contact roberts and rosen ##man about financing a similar , but much smaller , studio ko ##rn ##feld and lang hoped to build in woodstock , new york . [SEP]
[CLS] un ##pers ##ua ##ded by this studio - in - the - woods proposal , roberts and rosen ##man counter - proposed a concert featuring the kind of artists known to frequent the woodstock area ( such as bob dylan and the band ) . [SEP]
[CLS] ko ##rn ##feld and lang agreed to the new plan , and woodstock ventures was formed in january 1969 . [SEP]
[CLS] the company offices were located in an oddly decorated floor of 47 west 57th street in manhattan . [SEP]
[CLS] from the start , there were differences in approach among the four : roberts was disciplined and knew what was needed for the venture to succeed , while the laid - back lang saw woodstock as a new , " relaxed " way of bringing entrepreneurs together . [SEP]
[CLS] when lang was unable to find a site for the concert , roberts and rosen ##man , growing increasingly concerned , took to the road and eventually came up with a venue . [SEP]
[CLS] similar differences about financial discipline made roberts and rosen ##man wonder whether to pull the plug or to continue pumping money into the project . [SEP]
[CLS] in april 1969 , creed ##ence clear ##water revival became the first act to sign a contract for the event , agreeing to play for $ 10 , 000 ( equivalent to $ in ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it became a " free concert " only after the event drew hundreds of thousands more people than the organizers had prepared for . [SEP]
[CLS] ticket sales were limited to record stores in the greater new york city area , or by mail via a post office box at the radio city station post office located in midtown manhattan . [SEP]
[CLS] the original venue plan was for the festival to take place in wall ##kill , new york , possibly near the proposed recording studio site owned by alexander tap ##oo ##z . [SEP]
[CLS] after local residents quickly shot down that idea , lang and ko ##rn ##feld thought they had found another possible location in sa ##uge ##rti ##es , new york . [SEP]
[CLS] but they had misunderstood , as the landowner ' s attorney made clear , in a brief meeting with roberts and rosen ##man . [SEP]
[CLS] growing alarmed at the lack of progress , roberts and rosen ##man took over the search for a venue , and discovered the 300 acre mills industrial park in the town of wall ##kill , new york , which woodstock ventures leased for $ 10 , 000 ( equivalent to $ today ) in the spring of 1969 . [SEP]
[CLS] in early july , the town board passed a law requiring a permit for any gathering over 5 , 000 people . [SEP]
[CLS] reports of the ban , however , turned out to be a publicity bon ##anza for the festival . [SEP]
[CLS] in his 2007 book " taking woodstock " , elliot ti ##ber relates that he offered to host the event on his 15 acre motel grounds , and had a permit for such an event . [SEP]
[CLS] stop max ' s hip ##py music festival " , bethel town attorney frederick w . v . sc ##had ##t , building inspector donald clark and town supervisor daniel ama ##tu ##cci approved the festival permits , but the bethel town board refused to issue the permits formally . [SEP]
[CLS] subsequently , on august 2 , 1969 , the building inspector informed woodstock ventures , inc . that the stop work order was lifted , and the festival could proceed pending backing by the department of health and agriculture , and removal of all structures by september 1 , 1969 . [SEP]
[CLS] at a meeting three days before the event , organizers felt they had two options : one was to complete the fencing and ticket booths , without which the promoters would lose any profit or go into debt ; the other option involved putting their remaining available resources into building the stage , without which the promoters feared they would have a disappointed and di ##sg ##run ##tled audience . [SEP]
[CLS] those without tickets simply walked through gaps in the fences , and the organizers were forced to make the event free of charge . [SEP]
[CLS] though the festival left its promoters nearly bankrupt , their ownership of the film and recording rights more than compensated for the losses after the release of the hit documentary film " woodstock " in march 1970 . [SEP]
[CLS] the influx of attend ##ers to the rural concert site in bethel created a massive traffic jam . [SEP]
[CLS] the town of bethel did not enforce its codes , fearing chaos as the crowd flowed to the site . [SEP]
