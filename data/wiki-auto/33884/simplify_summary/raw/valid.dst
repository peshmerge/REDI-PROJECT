Woodstock was a music festival held August 15â€“18, 1969, at Max Yasgur's 600-acre dairy farm in Bethel, New York, 43 mi southwest of Woodstock.
Billed as "an Aquarian Exposition: 3 Days of Peace & Music", it attracted an audience of more than 400,000.
It was alternatively referred to as the Bethel Rock Festival or the Aquarian Music Festival.
Thirty-two acts performed outdoors despite sporadic rain.
The festival has become widely regarded as a pivotal moment in popular music history, as well as a defining event for the "counterculture generation".
The event's significance was reinforced by a 1970 documentary film, an accompanying , and a song written by Joni Mitchell that became major hits for Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and Matthews Southern Comfort.
Music events bearing the Woodstock name have been planned for anniversaries including the tenth, twentieth, twenty-fifth, thirtieth, fortieth, and fiftieth.
In 2004, "Rolling Stone" magazine listed it as number 19 of the "50 Moments That Changed the History of Rock and Roll".
In 2017, the festival site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Woodstock was initiated through the efforts of Michael Lang, Artie Kornfeld, Joel Rosenman, and John P. Roberts.
Roberts and Rosenman financed the project.
Lang had some experience as a promoter, having co-organized the Miami Pop Festival on the East Coast the prior year, where an estimated 25,000 people attended the two-day event.
Early in 1969, Roberts and Rosenman were New York City entrepreneurs, in the process of building Media Sound, a large audio recording studio complex in Manhattan.
Lang and Kornfeld's lawyer, Miles Lourie, who had done legal work on the Media Sound project, suggested that they contact Roberts and Rosenman about financing a similar, but much smaller, studio Kornfeld and Lang hoped to build in Woodstock, New York.
Unpersuaded by this Studio-in-the-Woods proposal, Roberts and Rosenman counter-proposed a concert featuring the kind of artists known to frequent the Woodstock area (such as Bob Dylan and The Band).
Kornfeld and Lang agreed to the new plan, and Woodstock Ventures was formed in January 1969.
The company offices were located in an oddly decorated floor of 47 West 57th Street in Manhattan.
Burt Cohen, and his design group, Curtain Call Productions, oversaw the psychedelic transformation of the office.
From the start, there were differences in approach among the four: Roberts was disciplined and knew what was needed for the venture to succeed, while the laid-back Lang saw Woodstock as a new, "relaxed" way of bringing entrepreneurs together.
When Lang was unable to find a site for the concert, Roberts and Rosenman, growing increasingly concerned, took to the road and eventually came up with a venue.
Similar differences about financial discipline made Roberts and Rosenman wonder whether to pull the plug or to continue pumping money into the project.
In April 1969, Creedence Clearwater Revival became the first act to sign a contract for the event, agreeing to play for $10,000 (equivalent to $ in ) .
The promoters had experienced difficulty landing big-name groups prior to Creedence committing to play.
Creedence drummer Doug Clifford later commented, "Once Creedence signed, everyone else jumped in line and all the other big acts came on."
Given their 3 a.m. start time and omission from the "Woodstock" film (at Creedence frontman John Fogerty's insistence), Creedence members have expressed bitterness over their experiences regarding the festival.
Woodstock was designed as a profit-making venture.
It became a "free concert" only after the event drew hundreds of thousands more people than the organizers had prepared for.
Tickets for the three-day event cost $18 in advance and $24 at the gate (equivalent to about $ and $ today).
Ticket sales were limited to record stores in the greater New York City area, or by mail via a post office box at the Radio City Station Post Office located in Midtown Manhattan.
Around 186,000 advance tickets were sold, and the organizers anticipated approximately 200,000 festival-goers would turn up.
The original venue plan was for the festival to take place in Wallkill, New York, possibly near the proposed recording studio site owned by Alexander Tapooz.
After local residents quickly shot down that idea, Lang and Kornfeld thought they had found another possible location in Saugerties, New York.
But they had misunderstood, as the landowner's attorney made clear, in a brief meeting with Roberts and Rosenman.
Growing alarmed at the lack of progress, Roberts and Rosenman took over the search for a venue, and discovered the 300 acre Mills Industrial Park in the town of Wallkill, New York, which Woodstock Ventures leased for $10,000 (equivalent to $ today) in the Spring of 1969.
Town officials were assured that no more than 50,000 would attend.
Town residents immediately opposed the project.
In early July, the Town Board passed a law requiring a permit for any gathering over 5,000 people.
On July 15, 1969, the Wallkill Zoning Board of Appeals officially banned the concert on the basis that the planned portable toilets would not meet town code.
Reports of the ban, however, turned out to be a publicity bonanza for the festival.
In his 2007 book "Taking Woodstock", Elliot Tiber relates that he offered to host the event on his 15 acre motel grounds, and had a permit for such an event.
He claims to have introduced the promoters to dairy farmer Max Yasgur.
Lang, however, disputes Tiber's account and says that Tiber introduced him to a realtor, who drove him to Yasgur's farm without Tiber.
Sam Yasgur, Max's son, agrees with Lang's account.
Yasgur's land formed a natural bowl sloping down to Filippini Pond on the land's north side.
The stage would be set up at the bottom of the hill with Filippini Pond forming a backdrop.
The pond would become a popular skinny dipping destination.
The organizers once again told Bethel authorities they expected no more than 50,000 people.
Despite resident opposition and signs proclaiming, "Buy No Milk.
Stop Max's Hippy Music Festival", Bethel Town Attorney Frederick W. V. Schadt, building inspector Donald Clark and Town Supervisor Daniel Amatucci approved the festival permits, but the Bethel Town Board refused to issue the permits formally.
Clark was ordered to post stop-work orders.
Subsequently, on August 2, 1969, the Building Inspector informed Woodstock Ventures, Inc. that the Stop Work Order was lifted, and the festival could proceed pending backing by the Department of Health and Agriculture, and removal of all structures by September 1, 1969.
The late change in venue did not give the festival organizers enough time to prepare.
At a meeting three days before the event, organizers felt they had two options: one was to complete the fencing and ticket booths, without which the promoters would lose any profit or go into debt; the other option involved putting their remaining available resources into building the stage, without which the promoters feared they would have a disappointed and disgruntled audience.
When the audience began arriving by the tens of thousands the next day, the Wednesday before the weekend, the decision was made for them.
Those without tickets simply walked through gaps in the fences, and the organizers were forced to make the event free of charge.
Though the festival left its promoters nearly bankrupt, their ownership of the film and recording rights more than compensated for the losses after the release of the hit documentary film "Woodstock" in March 1970.
The influx of attenders to the rural concert site in Bethel created a massive traffic jam.
The town of Bethel did not enforce its codes, fearing chaos as the crowd flowed to the site.
Eventually, radio and television descriptions of the traffic jams discouraged people from setting off to the festival.
