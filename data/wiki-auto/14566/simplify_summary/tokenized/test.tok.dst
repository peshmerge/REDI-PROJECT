[CLS] impression ##ism in music was a movement among various composers in western classical music ( mainly during the late 19th and early 20th centuries ) whose music focuses on mood and atmosphere , " convey ##ing the moods and emotions aroused by the subject rather than a detailed tone ‚Äê picture " . [SEP]
[CLS] " impression ##ism " is a philosophical and aesthetic term borrowed from late 19th - century french painting after mon ##et ' s " impression , sunrise " . [SEP]
[CLS] composers were labeled impression ##ists by analogy to the impression ##ist painters who use stark ##ly contrasting colors , effect of light on an object , blur ##ry fore ##ground and background , flat ##ten ##ing perspective , etc . to make the observer focus his attention on the overall impression . [SEP]
[CLS] the most prominent feature in musical impression ##ism is the use of " color " , or in musical terms , tim ##bre , which can be achieved through orchestra ##tion , harmonic usage , texture , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] other elements of music impression ##ism also involve new chord combinations , ambiguous ton ##ality , extended harmonies , use of modes and exotic scales , parallel motion , extra - musical ##ity , and ev ##oca ##tive titles such as " ref ##lets dans l ' ea ##u " ( reflections on the water , 1905 ) , " bro ##uil ##lard ##s " ( mist ##s , 1913 ) etc . [SEP]
[CLS] claude de ##bus ##sy and maurice rave ##l are two leading figures in impression ##ism , though de ##bus ##sy rejected this label ( in a 1908 letter he wrote " im ##be ##ci ##les call what i am trying to write in " images " ' impression ##ism ' , a term employed with the utmost ina ##cc ##ura ##cy , especially by art critics who use it as a label to stick on turner " ) and rave ##l displayed discomfort with it , at one point claiming that it could not be adequately applied to music at all . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##bus ##sy ' s impression ##ist works typically " ev ##oke a mood , feeling , atmosphere , or scene " by creating musical images through characteristic motifs , harmony , exotic scales ( e . g . , whole - tone and pen ##tat ##onic scales ) , instrumental tim ##bre , large un ##res ##olved chords ( e . g . , 9th ##s , 11th ##s , 13th ##s ) , parallel motion , ambiguous ton ##ality , extreme ch ##romatic ##ism , heavy use of the piano pedal ##s , and other elements . [SEP]
[CLS] some impression ##ist composers , de ##bus ##sy and rave ##l in particular , are also labeled as symbol ##ist composers . [SEP]
[CLS] one trait shared with both aesthetic trends is " a sense of detached observation : rather than expressing deeply felt emotion or telling a story " ; as in symbol ##ist poetry , the normal syntax is usually disrupted and individual images that carry the work ' s meaning are ev ##oked . [SEP]
[CLS] while impression ##ism only began as a movement after about 1890 , ernest fan ##elli was credited with in ##venting the style in the early 1880s . [SEP]
[CLS] however , his works were un ##per ##formed before 1912 . [SEP]
[CLS] the performance of his works in that year led to claims that he was the father of musical impression ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] rave ##l wrote , " this impression ##ism is certainly very different from that of present - day composers . . . mr . fan ##elli ' s impression ##ism derives more directly from be ##rl ##io ##z . " [SEP]
[CLS] he added that fan ##elli ' s alleged priority does not in any way dim ##ini ##sh the achievements of later composers : " the investigations of the young fan ##elli could not have diminished those of his colleagues . . . it is peculiar that these investigations suddenly assume importance because their embryo is discovered in a work written 30 years ago . " [SEP]
[CLS] other composers linked to impression ##ism include lil ##i bo ##ula ##nger , isaac al ##ben ##iz , frederick del ##ius , paul du ##kas , alexander sc ##ria ##bin , manuel de fall ##a , john al ##den carpenter , otto ##rino res ##pi ##ghi , charles tom ##linson gr ##iff ##es , and federico mom ##po ##u . [SEP]
[CLS] the finnish composer jean si ##bel ##ius is also associated with impression ##ism , and his tone poem " the swan of tu ##one ##la " ( 1893 ) pre ##dates de ##bus ##sy ' s " prelude a l ' apr ##es - midi d ' un fa ##une " ( regarded as a seminal work of musical impression ##ism ) by a year . [SEP]
[CLS] the american composer howard hanson also borrowed from both si ##bel ##ius and impression ##ism generally in works such as his second symphony . [SEP]
