impressionists were labeled impressionists by the impressionist painters who use starkly contrasting colours , effect of light on an object , blurry foreground and background , flattening perspective , etc .
to make the observer focus his attention on the overall impression .
the most important feature in musical impressionism is the use of " color " , or in musical terms , timbre .

claude debussy and maurice ravel were two leading figures in impressionism .
debussy 's impressionist works typically evoke a mood , feeling , atmosphere , or scene .
one trait shared with both aesthetic trends is " a sense of detached observation : rather than expressing deeply felt emotion or telling a story " .
he added that fanelli 's alleged priority does not in any way diminish the achievements of later composers : " the investigations of the young fanelli could not have diminished those of his colleagues . . . it is peculiar that these investigations suddenly assume importance because their embryo is discovered in a work written 30 years ago " .
the finnish composer jean sibelius is also associated with impressionism , and his tone poem " the swan of tuonela " gogh 's " prelude a l ' apres-midi d ' un fauneplin " .
