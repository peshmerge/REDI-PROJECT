[CLS] the eu ##gle ##no ##zo ##a are a large group of flag ##ella ##te ex ##ca ##vat ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] they include a variety of common free - living species , as well as a few important parasites , some of which in ##fect humans . [SEP]
[CLS] there are two main subgroup ##s , the eu ##gle ##ni ##ds and kin ##eto ##pl ##ast ##ids . [SEP]
[CLS] eu ##gle ##no ##zo ##a are un ##ice ##ll ##ular , mostly around 15 – 40 μ ##m in size , although some eu ##gle ##ni ##ds get up to 500 μ ##m long . [SEP]
[CLS] most eu ##gle ##no ##zo ##a have two flag ##ella , which are inserted parallel to one another in an apical or sub ##ap ##ical pocket . [SEP]
[CLS] in some these are associated with a cy ##tos ##tom ##e or mouth , used to ing ##est bacteria or other small organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] this is supported by one of three sets of micro ##tub ##ules that arise from the flag ##ella ##r bases ; the other two support the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cell . [SEP]
[CLS] some other eu ##gle ##no ##zo ##a feed through absorption , and many eu ##gle ##ni ##ds possess ch ##lor ##op ##las ##ts , the only eu ##kar ##yo ##tes outside dia ##ph ##ore ##tick ##es to do so without performing k ##le ##pt ##op ##las ##ty , and so obtain energy through photos ##yn ##thesis . [SEP]
[CLS] these ch ##lor ##op ##las ##ts are surrounded by three membranes and contain ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##ls " a " and " b " , along with other pigment ##s , so are probably derived from a captured green al ##ga . [SEP]
[CLS] reproduction occurs exclusively through cell division . [SEP]
[CLS] during mit ##osis , the nuclear membrane remains intact , and the spin ##dle micro ##tub ##ules form inside of it . [SEP]
[CLS] the group is characterized by the ultra ##st ##ru ##cture of the flag ##ella . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to the normal supporting micro ##tub ##ules or ax ##one ##me , each contains a rod ( called " para ##xon ##ema ##l " ) , which has a tubular structure in one flag ##ell ##um and a lattice ##d structure in the other . [SEP]
[CLS] based on this , two smaller groups have been included here : the dip ##lone ##mi ##ds and " post ##gaard ##i " . [SEP]
[CLS] the eu ##gle ##no ##zo ##a are generally accepted as mono ##phy ##let ##ic . [SEP]
[CLS] they are related to per ##col ##oz ##oa ; the two share mit ##och ##ond ##ria with disk - shaped cr ##ista ##e , which only occurs in a few other groups . [SEP]
[CLS] both probably belong to a larger group of eu ##kar ##yo ##tes called the ex ##ca ##vat ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] this grouping , though , has been challenged . [SEP]
[CLS] the ph ##yl ##ogen ##y based on the work of cavalier - smith 2016 . [SEP]
