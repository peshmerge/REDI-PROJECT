they include a variety of common free-living species , as well as a few important parasites , some of which infect humans .
there are two main types of the euglenids and kinetoplastids .
most euglenozoa have two flagella , parallel to one another in a pocket .
in some bacteria , a cytostome or mouth is used to ingest bacteria or other small organisms .
the other two support the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cell .
some other euglenozoa feed through absorption , and many euglenids possess chloroplasts , the only eukaryotes outside diaphoretickes to do so obtain energy through photosynthesis .
these chloroplasts are surrounded by three membranes and contain chlorophylls " a " and " b " , and so are probably derived from a captured green alga .
during mitosis , the nuclear membrane remains intact , and the microtubules form inside the cell .
based on this , two smaller groups have been included here : the diplonemids and " postgaardi " .
both probably belong to a larger group of eukaryotes called the excavata .
