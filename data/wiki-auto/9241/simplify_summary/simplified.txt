the euglenozoa are a large group of flagellate protists .
they include a variety of common free-living species , as well as a few important parasites , some of which infect humans .
there are two main types of the euglenids and kinetoplastids .
euglenozoa are unicellular , mostly around 15 – 40 μm in size , although some euglenids get up to 500 μm long .
most euglenozoa have two flagella , parallel to one another in a pocket .
in some bacteria , a cytostome or mouth is used to ingest bacteria or other small organisms .
the other two support the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cell .
some other euglenozoa feed through absorption , and many euglenids possess chloroplasts , the only eukaryotes outside diaphoretickes to do so obtain energy through photosynthesis .
these chloroplasts are surrounded by three membranes and contain chlorophylls " a " and " b " , and so are probably derived from a captured green alga .
reproduction occurs exclusively through cell division .
during mitosis , the nuclear membrane remains intact , and the microtubules form inside the cell .
the flagella is characterized by the ultrastructure of the flagella .
in addition to the normal supporting microtubules or axoneme , each contains a rodmind called paraxonemal ⟩ .
based on this , two smaller groups have been included here : the diplonemids and " postgaardi " .
the euglenozoa are monophyletic .
they are related to percolozoa .
both probably belong to a larger group of eukaryotes called the excavata .
this grouping , though , has been challenged .
the phylogeny based on the work of cavalier-smith 2016 .
