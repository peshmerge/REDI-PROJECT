[CLS] tuning is the process of adjusting the pitch of one or many tones from musical instruments to establish typical intervals between these tones . [SEP]
[CLS] tuning is usually based on a fixed reference , such as a = 440 hz . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " " out of tune " " refers to a pitch / tone that is either too high ( sharp ) or too low ( flat ) in relation to a given reference pitch . [SEP]
[CLS] while an instrument might be in tune relative to its own range of notes , it may not be considered ' in tune ' if it does not match the chosen reference pitch . [SEP]
[CLS] some instruments become ' out of tune ' with temperature , humidity , damage , or just time , and must be read ##just ##ed or repaired . [SEP]
[CLS] the sounds of some instruments such as cy ##mba ##ls are " in ##har ##mon ##ic " — they have irregular over ##tones not conform ##ing to the harmonic series . [SEP]
[CLS] tuning may be done aura ##lly by sounding two pitches and adjusting one of them to match or relate to the other . [SEP]
[CLS] a tuning fork or electronic tuning device may be used as a reference pitch , though in ensemble rehearsals often a piano is used ( as its pitch cannot be adjusted for each performance ) . [SEP]
[CLS] symphony orchestras and concert bands usually tune to an a ##44 ##0 or a b ##♭ , respectively , provided by the principal ob ##ois ##t or clarinet ##ist , who tune to the keyboard if part of the performance . [SEP]
[CLS] when only strings are used , then the principal string ( violinist ) typically has sounded the tuning pitch , but some orchestras have used an electronic tone machine for tuning . [SEP]
[CLS] interference beats are used to objective ##ly measure the accuracy of tuning . [SEP]
[CLS] as the two pitches approach a harmonic relationship , the frequency of beating decreases . [SEP]
[CLS] when tuning a unison or octave it is desired to reduce the beating frequency until it cannot be detected . [SEP]
[CLS] for other intervals , this is dependent on the tuning system being used . [SEP]
[CLS] harmonic ##s may be used to facilitate tuning of strings that are not themselves tuned to the unison . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , lightly touching the highest string of a cello at the middle ( at a node ) while bowing produces the same pitch as doing the same a third of the way down its second - highest string . [SEP]
[CLS] the resulting unison is more easily and quickly judged than the quality of the perfect fifth between the fundamental ##s of the two strings . [SEP]
[CLS] in music , the term open string refers to the fundamental note of the un ##sto ##pped , full string . [SEP]
[CLS] the strings of a guitar are normally tuned to fourth ##s ( except ##ing the g and b strings in standard tuning , which are tuned to a third ) , as are the strings of the bass guitar and double bass . [SEP]
[CLS] violin , viola , and cello strings are tuned to fifth ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] however , non - standard tuning ##s ( called sc ##ord ##at ##ura ) exist to change the sound of the instrument or create other playing options . [SEP]
[CLS] to tune an instrument , often only one reference pitch is given . [SEP]
[CLS] this reference is used to tune one string , to which the other strings are tuned in the desired intervals . [SEP]
[CLS] on a guitar , often the lowest string is tuned to an e . from this , each successive string can be tuned by finger ##ing the fifth fr ##et of an already tuned string and comparing it with the next higher string played open . [SEP]
[CLS] this works with the exception of the g string , which must be stopped at the fourth fr ##et to sound b against the open b string above . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatively , each string can be tuned to its own reference tone . [SEP]
[CLS] note that while the guitar and other modern string ##ed instruments with fixed fr ##ets are tuned in equal temperament , string instruments without fr ##ets , such as those of the violin family , are not . [SEP]
[CLS] the violin , viola , and cello are tuned to beatles ##s just perfect fifth ##s and ensembles such as string quartet ##s and orchestras tend to play in fifth ##s based p ##yt ##ha ##gor ##ean tuning or to compensate and play in equal temperament , such as when playing with other instruments such as the piano . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the cello , which is tuned down from a2 ##20 , has three more strings ( four total ) and the just perfect fifth is about two cents off from the equal tempered perfect fifth , making its lowest string , c - , about six cents more flat than the equal tempered c . [SEP]
[CLS] this table lists open strings on some common string instruments and their standard tuning ##s from low to high unless otherwise noted . [SEP]
[CLS] violin sc ##ord ##at ##ura was employed in the 17th and 18th centuries by italian and german composers , namely , bi ##agi ##o marin ##i , antonio viva ##ld ##i , heinrich ign ##az franz bi ##ber ( who in the " rosary sonata ##s " pre ##scribe ##s a great variety of sc ##ord ##at ##ura ##s , including crossing the middle strings ) , johann pac ##hel ##bel and johann sebastian bach , whose " fifth suite for una ##cco ##mp ##ani ##ed cello " calls for the lowering of the a string to g . [SEP]
[CLS] in mozart ' s " sin ##fo ##nia concert ##ante " in e - flat major ( k . 36 ##4 ) , all the strings of the solo viola are raised one half - step , ostensibly to give the instrument a brighter tone so the solo violin does not overs ##had ##ow it . [SEP]
[CLS] sc ##ord ##at ##ura for the violin was also used in the 19th and 20th centuries in works by niccolo pagan ##ini , robert schumann , camille saint - sa ##ens and bela bart ##ok . [SEP]
[CLS] in saint - sa ##ens ' " dans ##e mac ##ab ##re " , the high string of the violin is lower half a tone to the e ##♭ so as to have the most accent ##ed note of the main theme sound on an open string . [SEP]
[CLS] in bart ##ok ' s " contrasts " , the violin is tuned g ##♯ - d - a - e ##♭ to facilitate the playing of tri ##tones on open strings . [SEP]
[CLS] american folk violinist ##s of the appalachian ##s and oz ##ark ##s often employ alternate tuning ##s for dance songs and ballads . [SEP]
[CLS] the most commonly used tuning is a - e - a - e . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise banjo players in this tradition use many tuning ##s to play melody in different keys . [SEP]
[CLS] a common alternative banjo tuning for playing in d is a - d - a - d - e . [SEP]
[CLS] many folk guitar players also used different tuning ##s from standard , such as d - a - d - g - a - d , which is very popular for irish music . [SEP]
[CLS] a musical instrument that has had its pitch deliberately lowered during tuning is said to be " down - tuned " or " tuned down " . [SEP]
[CLS] common examples include the electric guitar and electric bass in contemporary heavy metal music , whereby one or more strings are often tuned lower than concert pitch . [SEP]
[CLS] this is not to be confused with electronically changing the fundamental frequency , which is referred to as pitch shifting . [SEP]
[CLS] many percussion instruments are " tuned " by the player , including pitched percussion instruments such as tim ##pani and tab ##la , and un ##pit ##ched percussion instruments such as the s ##nare drum . [SEP]
[CLS] tuning pitched percussion follows the same patterns as tuning any other instrument , but tuning un ##pit ##ched percussion does not produce a specific pitch . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason and others , the traditional terms " tuned percussion " and " un ##tu ##ned percussion " are avoided in recent organ ##ology . [SEP]
[CLS] a " tuning system " is the system used to define which tones , or pitches , to use when playing music . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , it is the choice of number and spa ##cing of frequency values used . [SEP]
[CLS] due to the psycho ##aco ##ust ##ic interaction of tones and tim ##bre ##s , various tone combinations sound more or less " natural " in combination with various tim ##bre ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , using harmonic tim ##bre ##s : more complex musical effects can be created through other relationships . [SEP]
[CLS] the creation of a tuning system is complicated because musicians want to make music with more than just a few differing tones . [SEP]
[CLS] as the number of tones is increased , conflicts arise in how each tone combines with every other . [SEP]
[CLS] finding a successful combination of tuning ##s has been the cause of debate , and has led to the creation of many different tuning systems across the world . [SEP]
[CLS] each tuning system has its own characteristics , strengths and weaknesses . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many techniques for theoretical comparison of tuning ##s , usually utilizing mathematical tools such as those of linear algebra , topology and group theory . [SEP]
[CLS] it is impossible to tune the twelve - note ch ##romatic scale so that all intervals are pure . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , three pure major thirds stack up to 125 / 64 , which at 115 ##9 cents is nearly a quarter tone away from the octave ( 1200 cents ) . [SEP]
[CLS] so there is no way to have both the octave and the major third in just into ##nation for all the intervals in the same twelve - tone system . [SEP]
[CLS] similar issues arise with the fifth 3 / 2 , and the minor third 6 / 5 or any other choice of harmonic - series based pure intervals . [SEP]
[CLS] many different compromise methods are used to deal with this , each with its own characteristics , and advantages and disadvantage ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] tuning systems that are not produced with exclusively just intervals are usually referred to as " temperament ##s " . [SEP]
