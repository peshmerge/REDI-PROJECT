Tuning is the process of adjusting the pitch of one or many tones from musical instruments to establish typical intervals between these tones.
While an instrument might be in tune relative to its own range of notes, it may not be considered 'in tune' if it does not match the chosen reference pitch.
The sounds of some instruments such as cymbals are "inharmonic"—they have irregular overtones not conforming to the harmonic series.
Tuning may be done aurally by sounding two pitches and adjusting one of them to match or relate to the other.
A tuning fork or electronic tuning device may be used as a reference pitch, though in ensemble rehearsals often a piano is used (as its pitch cannot be adjusted for each performance).
Symphony orchestras and concert bands usually tune to an A440 or a B♭, respectively, provided by the principal oboist or clarinetist, who tune to the keyboard if part of the performance.
When only strings are used, then the principal string (violinist) typically has sounded the tuning pitch, but some orchestras have used an electronic tone machine for tuning.
When tuning a unison or octave it is desired to reduce the beating frequency until it cannot be detected.
For other intervals, this is dependent on the tuning system being used.
Harmonics may be used to facilitate tuning of strings that are not themselves tuned to the unison.
The resulting unison is more easily and quickly judged than the quality of the perfect fifth between the fundamentals of the two strings.
In music, the term open string refers to the fundamental note of the unstopped, full string.
However, non-standard tunings (called scordatura) exist to change the sound of the instrument or create other playing options.
This reference is used to tune one string, to which the other strings are tuned in the desired intervals.
On a guitar, often the lowest string is tuned to an E. From this, each successive string can be tuned by fingering the fifth fret of an already tuned string and comparing it with the next higher string played open.
Note that while the guitar and other modern stringed instruments with fixed frets are tuned in equal temperament, string instruments without frets, such as those of the violin family, are not.
The violin, viola, and cello are tuned to beatless just perfect fifths and ensembles such as string quartets and orchestras tend to play in fifths based Pythagorean tuning or to compensate and play in equal temperament, such as when playing with other instruments such as the piano.
For example, the cello, which is tuned down from A220, has three more strings (four total) and the just perfect fifth is about two cents off from the equal tempered perfect fifth, making its lowest string, C-, about six cents more flat than the equal tempered C.
This table lists open strings on some common string instruments and their standard tunings from low to high unless otherwise noted.
Violin scordatura was employed in the 17th and 18th centuries by Italian and German composers, namely, Biagio Marini, Antonio Vivaldi, Heinrich Ignaz Franz Biber (who in the "Rosary Sonatas" prescribes a great variety of scordaturas, including crossing the middle strings), Johann Pachelbel and Johann Sebastian Bach, whose "Fifth Suite For Unaccompanied Cello" calls for the lowering of the A string to G.
In Mozart's "Sinfonia Concertante" in E-flat major (K. 364), all the strings of the solo viola are raised one half-step, ostensibly to give the instrument a brighter tone so the solo violin does not overshadow it.
In Saint-Saëns' "Danse Macabre", the high string of the violin is lower half a tone to the E♭ so as to have the most accented note of the main theme sound on an open string.
A musical instrument that has had its pitch deliberately lowered during tuning is said to be "down-tuned" or "tuned down".
Common examples include the electric guitar and electric bass in contemporary heavy metal music, whereby one or more strings are often tuned lower than concert pitch.
This is not to be confused with electronically changing the fundamental frequency, which is referred to as pitch shifting.
A "tuning system" is the system used to define which tones, or pitches, to use when playing music.
In other words, it is the choice of number and spacing of frequency values used.
The creation of a tuning system is complicated because musicians want to make music with more than just a few differing tones.
As the number of tones is increased, conflicts arise in how each tone combines with every other.
Finding a successful combination of tunings has been the cause of debate, and has led to the creation of many different tuning systems across the world.
There are many techniques for theoretical comparison of tunings, usually utilizing mathematical tools such as those of linear algebra, topology and group theory.
Many different compromise methods are used to deal with this, each with its own characteristics, and advantages and disadvantages.
