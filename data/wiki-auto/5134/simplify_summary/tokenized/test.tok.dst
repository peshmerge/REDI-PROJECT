[CLS] chess is a two - player strategy board game played on a check ##ered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8 ##× ##8 grid . [SEP]
[CLS] the game is played by millions of people worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] chess is believed to be derived from the indian game " chat ##ura ##nga " sometime before the 7th century . [SEP]
[CLS] chat ##ura ##nga is also the likely ancestor of the eastern strategy games " xiang ##qi " ( chinese chess ) , " jang ##gi " ( korean chess ) , and sho ##gi ( japanese chess ) . [SEP]
[CLS] chess reached europe by the 9th century , due to the um ##ay ##yad conquest of his ##pani ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] the pieces assumed their current powers in spain in the late 15th century ; the modern rules were standardized in the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] play involves no hidden information . [SEP]
[CLS] each player begins with 16 pieces : one king , one queen , two rook ##s , two knights , two bishops , and eight pawn ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] each piece type moves differently , with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the pawn . [SEP]
[CLS] the objective is to check ##mate the opponent ' s king by placing it under an in ##es ##cap ##able threat of capture . [SEP]
[CLS] to this end , a player ' s pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent ' s pieces , while supporting each other . [SEP]
[CLS] during the game , play typically involves exchanging pieces for the opponent ' s similar pieces , and finding and engineering opportunities to trade advantage ##ously or to get a better position . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to check ##mate , a player wins the game if the opponent resign ##s , or ( in a timed game ) runs out of time . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also several ways that a game can end in a draw . [SEP]
[CLS] the first generally recognized world chess champion , wilhelm stein ##itz , claimed his title in 1886 . [SEP]
[CLS] since 1948 , the world championship has been regulated by the federation internationale des ec ##he ##cs ( fide ) , the game ' s international governing body . [SEP]
[CLS] fide also awards life - time master titles to skilled players , the highest of which is grandmaster ( gm ) . [SEP]
[CLS] many national chess organizations have a title system of their own . [SEP]
[CLS] fide also organizes the women ' s world championship , the world junior championship , the world senior championship , the blitz and rapid world championships , and the chess olympiad , a popular competition among international teams . [SEP]
[CLS] fide is a member of the international olympic committee , which can be considered recognition of chess as a sport . [SEP]
[CLS] several national sporting bodies ( e . g . the spanish " con ##se ##jo superior de de ##port ##es " ) also recognize chess as a sport . [SEP]
[CLS] chess was included in the 2006 and 2010 asian games . [SEP]
[CLS] there is also a correspondence chess world championship and a world computer chess championship . [SEP]
[CLS] online chess has opened amateur and professional competition to a wide and varied group of players . [SEP]
[CLS] since the second half of the 20th century , chess engines have been programmed to play with increasing success , to the point where the strongest programs play at a higher level than the best human players . [SEP]
[CLS] since the 1990s , computer analysis has contributed significantly to chess theory , particularly in the end ##game . [SEP]
[CLS] the ibm computer deep blue was the first machine to overcome a reigning world chess champion in a match when it defeated garry ka ##spar ##ov in 1997 . [SEP]
[CLS] the rise of strong chess engines run ##nable on hand - held devices has led to increasing concern about cheating during tournaments . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many variants of chess that utilize different rules , pieces , or boards . [SEP]
[CLS] one of these , chess ##9 ##60 , has gained widespread popularity as well as some fide recognition . [SEP]
[CLS] the rules of chess are published by fide ( " federation internationale des ec ##he ##cs " ) , chess ' s international governing body , in its " handbook " . [SEP]
[CLS] rules published by national governing bodies , or by una ##ffi ##lia ##ted chess organizations , commercial publishers , etc . , may differ . [SEP]
[CLS] fide ' s rules were most recently revised in 2017 . [SEP]
[CLS] by convention , chess game pieces are divided into white and black sets . [SEP]
[CLS] each set consists of 16 pieces : one king , one queen , two rook ##s , two bishops , two knights , and eight pawn ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo . [SEP]
[CLS] the players of the sets are referred to as " white " and " black " , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] the game is played on a square board of eight rows ( called " ranks " , denoted " 1 " to " 8 " from bottom to top according to white ' s perspective ) and eight columns ( called " files " , denoted " a " to " h " from left to right according to white ' s perspective ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as " light " and " dark " squares . [SEP]
[CLS] the chess ##board is placed with a light square at the right - hand corner nearest to each player . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , each queen starts on a square of its own color ( the white queen on a light square ; the black queen on a dark square ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in competitive games , the colors are allocated by the organizers ; in informal games , the colors are usually decided randomly , for example by coin toss , or by one player ' s conceal ##ing a white and black pawn in either hand and having the opponent choose . [SEP]
[CLS] white moves first , after which players alternate turns , moving one piece per turn ( except for cast ##ling , when two pieces are moved ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a piece is moved to either an uno ##cc ##up ##ied square or one occupied by an opponent ' s piece , which is captured and removed from play . [SEP]
[CLS] with the sole exception of " en pass ##ant " , all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent ' s piece occupies . [SEP]
[CLS] moving is compulsory ; it is illegal to skip a turn , even when having to move is detrimental . [SEP]
[CLS] a player may not make any move that would put or leave the player ' s own king in check . [SEP]
[CLS] if the player to move has no legal move , the game is over ; the result is either check ##mate ( a loss for the player with no legal move ) if the king is in check , or stale ##mate ( a draw ) if the king is not . [SEP]
[CLS] each piece has its own way of moving . [SEP]
[CLS] in the diagrams , the dots mark the squares to which the piece can move if there are no intervening piece ( s ) of either color ( except the knight , which leaps over any intervening pieces ) . [SEP]
[CLS] once in every game , each king can make a special move , known as " cast ##ling " . [SEP]
[CLS] cast ##ling consists of moving the king two squares along the first rank toward a rook ( that is on the player ' s first rank and then placing the rook on the last square that the king just crossed . [SEP]
[CLS] when a pawn makes a two - step advance from its starting position and there is an opponent ' s pawn on a square next to the destination square on an adjacent file , then the opponent ' s pawn can capture it " en pass ##ant " ( " in passing " ) , moving to the square the pawn passed over . [SEP]
[CLS] this can be done only on the very next turn ; otherwise the right to do so is for ##feit ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in the animated diagram , the black pawn advances two steps from g ##7 to g ##5 , and the white pawn on f ##5 can take it " en pass ##ant " on g ##6 ( but only on white ' s next move ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when a pawn advances to the eighth rank , as a part of the move it is " promoted " and must be exchanged for the player ' s choice of queen , rook , bishop , or knight of the same color . [SEP]
[CLS] usually , the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen , but in some cases another piece is chosen ; this is called under ##pro ##mot ##ion . [SEP]
[CLS] in the animated diagram , the pawn on c ##7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no restriction on the piece promoted to , so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game ( e . g . , two or more queens ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent ' s pieces , it is said to be " in check " . [SEP]
[CLS] a move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in check . [SEP]
[CLS] this can involve capturing the checking piece ; inter ##po ##sing a piece between the checking piece and the king ( which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen , rook , or bishop and there is a square between it and the king ) ; or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack . [SEP]
[CLS] cast ##ling is not a per ##missible response to a check . [SEP]
[CLS] the object of the game is to check ##mate the opponent ; this occurs when the opponent ' s king is in check , and there is no legal way to remove it from attack . [SEP]
[CLS] it is never legal for a player to make a move that puts or leaves the player ' s own king in check . [SEP]
[CLS] in casual games it is common to announce " check " when putting the opponent ' s king in check , but this is not required by the rules of chess , and is not usually done in tournaments . [SEP]
[CLS] in competition , chess games are played with a time control . [SEP]
[CLS] if a player ' s time runs out before the game is completed , the game is automatically lost ( provided the opponent has enough pieces left to deliver check ##mate ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the duration of a game ranges from long ( or " classical " ) games which can take up to seven hours ( even longer if ad ##jou ##rn ##ments are permitted ) to bullet chess ( under 3 minutes per player for the entire game ) . [SEP]
[CLS] intermediate between these are rapid chess games , lasting between 20 minutes and two hours per game , a popular time control in amateur weekend tournaments . [SEP]
[CLS] time is controlled using a chess clock that has two displays , one for each player ' s remaining time . [SEP]
[CLS] analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks , which allow for time controls with inc ##rem ##ents . [SEP]
[CLS] time controls are also enforced in correspondence chess competition . [SEP]
[CLS] a typical time control is 50 days for every 10 moves . [SEP]
[CLS] chess is believed to have originated in eastern india , 280 – 550 , in the gupta empire , where its early form in the 6th century was known as " chat ##ura ##nga " , literally " four divisions " of the military – infantry , cavalry , elephants , and chariot ##ry , represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn , knight , bishop , and rook , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] thence it spread eastward and westward along the silk road . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest evidence of chess is found in the nearby sas ##san ##id persia around 600 , where the game came to be known by the name " chat ##rang " . [SEP]
[CLS] chat ##rang was taken up by the muslim world after the islamic conquest of persia ( 63 ##3 – 44 ) , where it was then named " sha ##tra ##n ##j " , with the pieces largely retaining their persian names . [SEP]
[CLS] in spanish " sha ##tra ##n ##j " was rendered as " aj ##ed ##re ##z " ( " al - sha ##tra ##n ##j " ) , in portuguese as " x ##ad ##re ##z " , and in greek as ζ ##α ##τ ##ρ ##ι ##κ ##ι ##ο ##ν ( " za ##tri ##ki ##on " , which comes directly from the persian " chat ##rang " ) , but in the rest of europe it was replaced by versions of the persian " shah " ( " king " ) , which was familiar as an ex ##cl ##ama ##tion and became the english words " check " and " chess " . [SEP]
[CLS] the oldest archaeological chess artifacts , ivory pieces , were excavated in ancient af ##rasia ##b , today ' s sam ##ark ##and , in uzbekistan , central asia , and date to about 760 , with some of them possibly older . [SEP]
[CLS] the oldest known chess manual was in arabic and dates to 840 – 850 , written by al - ad ##li ar - rum ##i ( 800 – 870 ) , a renowned arab chess player , titled " kit ##ab ash - sha ##tra ##n ##j " ( book of the chess ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a lost manuscript , but referenced in later works . [SEP]
[CLS] the eastern migration of chess , into china and southeast asia , has even less documentation than its migration west . [SEP]
[CLS] the first reference to chinese chess , called " xiang ##qi " , appears in a book entitled " xu ##an gu ##ai lu " ( " record of the mysterious and strange " ) , dating to about 800 . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatively , some contend that chess arose from chinese chess or one of its predecessors , although this has been contested . [SEP]
[CLS] the game reached western europe and russia by at least three routes , the earliest being in the 9th century . [SEP]
[CLS] by the year 1000 , it had spread throughout both muslim ib ##eria and latin europe . [SEP]
[CLS] a latin poem " de sc ##achi ##s " dated to the late 10th century has been preserved in ein ##sie ##del ##n abbey . [SEP]
[CLS] a famous 13th - century manuscript covering sha ##tra ##n ##j , back ##gam ##mon , and dice is known as the " li ##bro de los ju ##ego ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] around 1200 , the rules of sha ##tra ##n ##j started to be modified in southern europe , and around 147 ##5 , several major changes made the game essentially as it is known today . [SEP]
[CLS] these modern rules for the basic moves had been adopted in italy and spain . [SEP]
[CLS] pawn ##s gained the option of advancing two squares on their first move , while bishops and queens acquired their modern abilities . [SEP]
[CLS] the queen replaced the earlier viz ##ier chess piece towards the end of the 10th century and by the 15th century had become the most powerful piece ; consequently modern chess was referred to as " queen ' s chess " or " mad queen chess " . [SEP]
[CLS] cast ##ling , derived from the " kings leap " usually in combination with a pawn or rook move to bring the king to safety , was introduced . [SEP]
[CLS] these new rules quickly spread throughout western europe . [SEP]
[CLS] writings about the theory of how to play chess began to appear in the 15th century . [SEP]
[CLS] the " rep ##etic ##ion de amore ##s y arte de aj ##ed ##re ##z " ( " repetition of love and the art of playing chess " ) by spanish church ##man luis ramirez de luce ##na was published in salamanca in 149 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] luce ##na and later masters like portuguese pedro damian ##o , italians giovanni leonardo di bon ##a , gi ##ulio cesare pole ##rio and gi ##oa ##chin ##o greco , and spanish bishop ru ##y lopez de se ##gur ##a developed elements of openings and started to analyze simple end ##games . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 18th century , the center of european chess life moved from the southern european countries to france . [SEP]
[CLS] the two most important french masters were francois - andre dani ##can phil ##ido ##r , a musician by profession , who discovered the importance of pawn ##s for chess strategy , and later louis - charles ma ##he de la bo ##ur ##don ##nais , who won a famous series of matches with the irish master alexander mcdonnell in 1834 . [SEP]
[CLS] centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in major european cities like " cafe de la reg ##ence " in paris and " simpson ' s diva ##n " in london . [SEP]
[CLS] the rules concerning stale ##mate were finalized in the early 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] also in the 19th century , the convention that white moves first was established ( formerly either white or black could move first ) . [SEP]
[CLS] finally the rules around cast ##ling were standardized – variations in the cast ##ling rules had persisted in italy until the late 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] the resulting standard game is sometimes referred to as " western chess " or " international chess " , particularly in asia where other games of the chess family such as xiang ##qi are prevalent . [SEP]
[CLS] since the 19th century , the only rule changes have been technical in nature , for example establishing the correct procedure for claiming a draw by repetition . [SEP]
[CLS] as the 19th century progressed , chess organization developed quickly . [SEP]
[CLS] many chess clubs , chess books , and chess journals appeared . [SEP]
[CLS] there were correspondence matches between cities ; for example , the london chess club played against the edinburgh chess club in 1824 . [SEP]
[CLS] chess problems became a regular part of 19th - century newspapers ; bernhard ho ##r ##witz , josef k ##ling , and samuel lo ##yd composed some of the most influential problems . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1843 , von der las ##a published his and bi ##l ##gue ##r ' s " hand ##buch des sc ##ha ##chs ##pie ##ls " ( " handbook of chess " ) , the first comprehensive manual of chess theory . [SEP]
[CLS] chess was occasionally criticized in the 19th century as a waste of time . [SEP]
[CLS] the first modern chess tournament was organized by howard st ##au ##nton , a leading english chess player , and was held in london in 1851 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was won by the german adolf anders ##sen , who was hailed as the leading chess master . [SEP]
[CLS] his brilliant , energetic attacking style was typical for the time . [SEP]
[CLS] sparkling games like anders ##sen ' s immortal game and evergreen game or mor ##phy ' s " opera game " were regarded as the highest possible summit of the chess art . [SEP]
[CLS] the romantic era was characterized by opening ga ##mbit ##s ( sac ##ri ##fi ##cing pawn ##s or even pieces ) , daring attacks , and bra ##zen sacrifices . [SEP]
[CLS] many elaborate and beautiful but un ##so ##und move sequences called " combinations " were played by the masters of the time . [SEP]
[CLS] the game was played more for art than theory . [SEP]
[CLS] a profound belief that chess merit resided in the players ' genius rather than inherent in the position on the board per ##va ##ded chess practice . [SEP]
[CLS] deeper insight into the nature of chess came with the american paul mor ##phy , an extraordinary chess prodigy . [SEP]
[CLS] mor ##phy won against all important competitors ( except st ##au ##nton , who refused to play ) , including anders ##sen , during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863 . [SEP]
[CLS] mor ##phy ' s success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy ; he intuitive ##ly knew how to prepare attacks . [SEP]
[CLS] prague - born wilhelm stein ##itz beginning in 1873 described how to avoid weaknesses in one ' s own position and how to create and exploit such weaknesses in the opponent ' s position . [SEP]
[CLS] the scientific approach and position ##al understanding of stein ##itz revolution ##ized the game . [SEP]
[CLS] stein ##itz was the first to break a position down into its components . [SEP]
[CLS] before stein ##itz , players brought their queen out early , did not completely develop their other pieces , and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king , which either succeeded or failed . [SEP]
[CLS] the level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep plan . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to his theoretical achievements , stein ##itz founded an important tradition : his triumph over the leading german master johannes zu ##ker ##tort in 1886 is regarded as the first official world chess championship . [SEP]
[CLS] stein ##itz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player , the german mathematician emanuel las ##ker , who maintained this title for 27 years , the longest tenure of any world champion . [SEP]
[CLS] after the end of the 19th century , the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew . [SEP]
[CLS] some sources state that in 1914 the title of chess grandmaster was first formally conferred by tsar nicholas ii of russia to las ##ker , cap ##ab ##lan ##ca , ale ##kh ##ine , tar ##ras ##ch , and marshall , but this is a disputed claim . [SEP]
[CLS] the tradition of awarding such titles was continued by the world chess federation ( fide ) , founded in 1924 in paris . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1927 , the women ' s world chess championship was established ; the first to hold the title was czech - english master vera men ##chi ##k . [SEP]
[CLS] it took a prodigy from cuba , jose raul cap ##ab ##lan ##ca ( world champion 1921 – 1927 ) , who loved simple positions and end ##games , to end the german - speaking dominance in chess ; he was undefeated in tournament play for eight years , until 1924 . [SEP]
[CLS] his successor was russian - french alexander ale ##kh ##ine , a strong attacking player who died as the world champion in 1946 . [SEP]
[CLS] he briefly lost the title to dutch player max eu ##we in 1935 and regained it two years later . [SEP]
[CLS] between the world wars , chess was revolution ##ized by the new theoretical school of so - called hyper ##mo ##dern ##ists like ar ##on ni ##m ##zow ##its ##ch and richard re ##ti . [SEP]
[CLS] they advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawn ##s , thus inviting opponents to occupy the center with pawn ##s , which become objects of attack . [SEP]
[CLS] after the death of ale ##kh ##ine , a new world champion was sought . [SEP]
[CLS] fide , which has controlled the title since then ( except for one interruption ) , ran a tournament of elite players . [SEP]
[CLS] the winner of the 1948 tournament , russian mikhail bot ##vin ##nik , started an era of soviet dominance in the chess world . [SEP]
[CLS] until the end of the soviet union , there was only one non - soviet champion , american bobby fischer ( champion 1972 – 1975 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] bot ##vin ##nik revolution ##ized opening theory . [SEP]
[CLS] previously black st ##rove for equality , to neutral ##ize white ' s first - move advantage . [SEP]
[CLS] as black , bot ##vin ##nik st ##rove for the initiative from the beginning . [SEP]
[CLS] in the previous informal system of world championships , the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match . [SEP]
[CLS] fide set up a new system of qualifying tournaments and matches . [SEP]
[CLS] the world ' s strongest players were seeded into inter ##zon ##al tournaments , where they were joined by players who had qualified from z ##onal tournaments . [SEP]
[CLS] the leading finish ##ers in these inter ##zon ##als would go on the " candidates " stage , which was initially a tournament , and later a series of knockout matches . [SEP]
[CLS] the winner of the candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title . [SEP]
[CLS] a champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later . [SEP]
[CLS] this system operated on a three - year cycle . [SEP]
[CLS] bot ##vin ##nik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years . [SEP]
[CLS] he won the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1957 , he lost to va ##sily sm ##ys ##lov , but regained the title in a rematch in 1958 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1960 , he lost the title to the 23 - year - old latvian prodigy mikhail tal , an accomplished tactic ##ian and attacking player . [SEP]
[CLS] bot ##vin ##nik again regained the title in a rematch in 1961 . [SEP]
[CLS] following the 1961 event , fide abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch , and the next champion , armenian ti ##gra ##n pet ##ros ##ian , a player renowned for his defensive and position ##al skills , held the title for two cycles , 1963 – 1969 . [SEP]
[CLS] his successor , boris spa ##ss ##ky from russia ( champion 1969 – 1972 ) , won games in both position ##al and sharp tactical style . [SEP]
[CLS] the next championship , the so - called match of the century , saw the first non - soviet challenger since world war ii , american bobby fischer , who defeated his candidates opponents by un ##heard - of margins and clearly won the world championship match . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1975 , however , fischer refused to defend his title against soviet ana ##to ##ly ka ##rp ##ov when fide did not meet his demands , and ka ##rp ##ov obtained the title by default . [SEP]
[CLS] fischer modernized many aspects of chess , especially by extensively preparing openings . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##rp ##ov defended his title twice against viktor ko ##rch ##no ##i and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a string of tournament successes . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##rp ##ov ' s reign finally ended in 1985 at the hands of garry ka ##spar ##ov , another soviet player from baku , azerbaijan . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##spar ##ov and ka ##rp ##ov contested five world title matches between 1984 and 1990 ; ka ##rp ##ov never won his title back . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1993 , garry ka ##spar ##ov and nigel short broke with fide to organize their own match for the title and formed a competing professional chess association ( pc ##a ) . [SEP]
[CLS] from then until 2006 , there were two simultaneous world champions and world championships : the pc ##a or classical champion extending the stein ##itz ##ian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of many games , and the other following fide ' s new format of many players competing in a tournament to determine the champion . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##spar ##ov lost his classical title in 2000 to vladimir k ##ram ##nik of russia . [SEP]
[CLS] the world chess championship 2006 , in which k ##ram ##nik beat the fide world champion ve ##sel ##in top ##alo ##v , re ##uni ##fied the titles and made k ##ram ##nik the und ##is ##puted world chess champion . [SEP]
[CLS] in september 2007 , he lost the title to vis ##wana ##than anand of india , who won the championship tournament in mexico city . [SEP]
[CLS] anand defended his title in the revenge match of 2008 , 2010 and 2012 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2013 , magnus carl ##sen beat anand in the 2013 world chess championship . [SEP]
[CLS] he defended his title the following year , again against anand . [SEP]
[CLS] carl ##sen confirmed his title in 2016 against the russian sergey ka ##r ##jak ##in and in 2018 against the american fabian ##o car ##uan ##a , in both occasions by a rapid tie ##breaker match after equality in 12 games of classical time control , and is the reigning world champion . [SEP]
[CLS] in the middle ages and during the renaissance , chess was a part of noble culture ; it was used to teach war strategy and was dubbed the " king ' s game " . [SEP]
[CLS] gentlemen are " to be mean ##ly seen ##e in the play at chest ##es " , says the overview at the beginning of bald ##ass ##are cast ##ig ##lion ##e ' s " the book of the court ##ier " ( 152 ##8 , english 156 ##1 by sir thomas ho ##by ) , but chess should not be a gentleman ' s main passion . [SEP]
[CLS] and what say you to the game at chest ##es ? [SEP]
[CLS] it is true ##ly an honest ky ##nde of enter ##te ##yn ##ment ##e and wit ##tie , quo ##th sy ##r fr ##ider ##ick . [SEP]
[CLS] but me think it hat ##h a fault , which ##e is , that a man may be to co ##uni ##ng at it , for who ever will be excellent in the play ##e of chest ##es , i bel ##ea ##ve he must bees ##tow ##e much ty ##me about it , and app ##lie it with so much study , that a man may ass ##oon ##e learn ##e some noble sc ##yen ##ce , or com ##pas ##e any other matter of import ##au ##nce , and yet in the end ##e in bees ##tow ##ing all that labour ##e , he know ##eth no more but a game . [SEP]
[CLS] the ##rf ##ore in this i bel ##ea ##ve there happen ##eth a very rare thing , namely , that the mean ##e is more com ##men ##dable , then the excel ##len ##cy . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the elaborate chess sets used by the aristocracy have been lost , but others partially survive , such as the lewis chess ##men . [SEP]
[CLS] chess was often used as a basis of sermons on morality . [SEP]
[CLS] an example is " li ##ber de mori ##bus ho ##min ##um et off ##ici ##is no ##bil ##ium si ##ve super lu ##do sc ##ac ##cho ##rum " ( ' book of the customs of men and the duties of nobles or the book of chess ' ) , written by an italian dominican monk jacob ##us de ce ##sso ##lis 1300 . [SEP]
[CLS] this book was one of the most popular of the middle ages . [SEP]
[CLS] the work was translated into many other languages ( the first printed edition was published at utrecht in 147 ##3 ) and was the basis for william ca ##xton ' s " the game and play ##e of the chess ##e " ( 147 ##4 ) , one of the first books printed in english . [SEP]
[CLS] the kn ##y ##ght ought to be made all ##e armed upon an ho ##rs in such ##e w ##yse that he ha ##ue an helm ##e on his hee ##d and a sp ##ere in his ry ##ght hand ##e / and co ##uer ##yd w ##yt ##h his she ##ld / a sw ##er ##de and a mace on his l ##y ##ft sy ##de / clad ##d w ##yt ##h an ha ##w ##ber ##k and plates to fore his brest ##e / leg ##ge ha ##rno ##ys on his leg ##ges / spores on his heel ##is on his hand ##es his gaunt ##ele ##ttes / his ho ##rs well broken and taught and apt ##e to bat ##ay ##lle and co ##uer ##id with his arm ##es / w ##han the kn ##y ##ght ##es ben ma ##ad they ben bay ##ned or bathed / that is the sign ##e that they sho ##ld led ##e a new ##e l ##y ##f and new ##e mane ##rs / also they wake all ##e the ny ##ght in prayers and or ##yson ##s v ##nto god that he w ##yl ##le g ##yu ##e hem grace that they may get ##e that thy ##nge that they may not get ##e by nature / the ky ##nge or pry ##nce g ##yr ##de ##th a bout ##e them a sw ##er ##de in sign ##e / that they sho ##ld ab ##yde and ke ##pe h ##ym of whom they take they ##r di ##sp ##ense ##s and dig ##ny ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] known in the circles of cleric ##s , students , and merchants , chess entered into the popular culture of middle ages . [SEP]
[CLS] an example is the 209 ##th song of car ##mina bu ##rana from the 13th century , which starts with the names of chess pieces , " roc ##h , pe ##dit ##es , regina . . . " [SEP]
[CLS] during the age of enlightenment , chess was viewed as a means of self - improvement . [SEP]
[CLS] benjamin franklin , in his article " the morals of chess " ( 1750 ) , wrote : the game of chess is not merely an idle amusement ; several very valuable qualities of the mind , useful in the course of human life , are to be acquired and strengthened by it , so as to become habits ready on all occasions ; for life is a kind of chess , in which we have often points to gain , and competitors or ad ##vers ##aries to contend with , and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events , that are , in some degree , the effect of pr ##udence , or the want of it .

[CLS] caution , not to make our moves too hastily . . . with these or similar views , chess is taught to children in schools around the world today . [SEP]
[CLS] many schools host chess clubs , and there are many scholastic tournaments specifically for children . [SEP]
[CLS] tournaments are held regularly in many countries , hosted by organizations such as the united states chess federation and the national scholastic chess foundation . [SEP]
[CLS] chess is often depicted in the arts ; significant works where chess plays a key role range from thomas middleton ' s " a game at chess " to " through the looking - glass " by lewis carroll , to vladimir na ##bo ##kov ' s " the defense " , to " the royal game " by stefan z ##weig . [SEP]
[CLS] chess is featured in films like ing ##mar bergman ' s " the seventh seal " and sat ##ya ##jit ray ' s " the chess players " . [SEP]
[CLS] chess is also present in contemporary popular culture . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the characters in " star trek " play a futuristic version of the game called " tri - dimensional chess " . [SEP]
[CLS] " wizard ' s chess " is featured in j . k . row ##ling ' s " harry potter " plays . [SEP]
[CLS] the hero of " searching for bobby fischer " struggles against adopting the aggressive and mis ##ant ##hr ##op ##ic views of a world chess champion . [SEP]
[CLS] chess is used as the core theme in the musical " chess " by tim rice , bjorn ul ##va ##eus , and benny andersson . [SEP]
[CLS] the thriller film " knight moves " is about a chess grandmaster who is accused of being a serial killer . [SEP]
[CLS] " pawn sacrifice " , starring to ##bey maguire as bobby fischer and lie ##v sc ##hre ##ibe ##r as boris spa ##ss ##ky , depicts the drama surrounding the 1972 world chess championship in iceland during the cold war . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1979 in islamic republic of iran , grand a ##yat ##oll ##ah ru ##hol ##lah k ##hom ##ein ##i issued a religious fat ##wa ruling against chess on the grounds that it " excessive ##ly fatigue ##s the brain " and constitutes gambling . [SEP]
[CLS] the same a ##yat ##oll ##ah lifted the ban in 1988 , however , and said it was per ##missible as long as it was not a means of gambling . [SEP]
[CLS] iran now has an active confederation for playing chess and sends players to international events . [SEP]
[CLS] grand a ##yat ##oll ##ah ali al - sis ##tani of iraq , issued multiple fat ##was against chess and back ##gam ##mon ruling that playing both “ is absolutely forbidden even without placing a bet ” . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2016 in saudi arabia , grand mu ##ft ##i abdul - aziz ibn abdullah al ash - sheikh issued a religious fat ##wa ruling that chess is forbidden in islam because it constitutes gambling , stating " chess is a waste of time and an opportunity to sq ##uan ##der money . [SEP]
[CLS] it causes en ##mity and hatred between people . " [SEP]
[CLS] this fat ##wa is not legally binding , however , and chess remains a popular game in muslim countries . [SEP]
[CLS] chess games and positions are recorded using a system of notation , most commonly algebraic chess notation . [SEP]
[CLS] abbreviated algebraic ( or short algebraic ) notation generally records moves in the format : the pieces are identified by their initials . [SEP]
[CLS] in english , these are " k " ( king ) , " q " ( queen ) , " r " ( rook ) , " b " ( bishop ) , and " n " ( knight ; n is used to avoid confusion with king ) . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , q ##g ##5 means " queen moves to the g - file , 5th rank " ( that is , to the square g ##5 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] chess literature published in other languages may use different initials for pieces , or fig ##uri ##ne algebraic notation ( fan ) may be used to avoid language issues . [SEP]
[CLS] to resolve am ##bi ##gui ##ties , an additional letter or number is added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved ( e . g . ng ##f ##3 means " knight from the g - file moves to the square f ##3 " ; r ##1 ##e ##2 means " rook on the first rank moves to e ##2 " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the letter " p " for pawn is not used ; so e ##4 means " pawn moves to the square e ##4 " . [SEP]
[CLS] if the piece makes a capture , " x " is inserted before the destination square . [SEP]
[CLS] thus b ##x ##f ##3 means " bishop captures on f ##3 " . [SEP]
[CLS] when a pawn makes a capture , the file from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial , and ranks may be omitted if una ##mb ##ig ##uous . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , ex ##d ##5 ( pawn on the e - file captures the piece on d ##5 ) or ex ##d ( pawn on the e - file captures a piece somewhere on the d - file ) . [SEP]
[CLS] particularly in germany , some publications use " : " rather than " x " to indicate capture , but this is now rare . [SEP]
[CLS] some publications om ##it the capture symbol altogether ; so ex ##d ##5 would be rendered simply as ed . [SEP]
[CLS] if a pawn moves to its last rank , achieving promotion , the piece chosen is indicated after the move ( for example , e ##1 ##q or e ##1 = q ) . [SEP]
[CLS] cast ##ling is indicated by the special notation ##s 0 - 0 for kings ##ide cast ##ling and 0 - 0 - 0 for queens ##ide cast ##ling . [SEP]
[CLS] an " en pass ##ant " capture is sometimes marked with the notation " e . p . " a move that places the opponent ' s king in check usually has the notation " + " added ( the notation " + + " for a double check is considered obsolete ) . [SEP]
[CLS] check ##mate can be indicated by " # " . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of the game , " 1 – 0 " means white won , " 0 – 1 " means black won , and " 1 ##⁄ ##2 – 1 ##⁄ ##2 " indicates a draw . [SEP]
[CLS] chess moves can be ann ##ota ##ted with pun ##ct ##uation marks and other symbols . [SEP]
[CLS] indicates a good move ; " ! ! " [SEP]
[CLS] an excellent move ; " ? " [SEP]
[CLS] an interesting move that may not be best ; or " ? ! " [SEP]
[CLS] a dubious move not easily ref ##uted . ) [SEP]
[CLS] the text - based portable game notation ( pg ##n ) , which is understood by chess software , is based on short form english language algebraic notation . [SEP]
[CLS] until about 1980 , the majority of english language chess publications used a form of descriptive notation . [SEP]
[CLS] in descriptive notation , files are named according to the piece which occupies the back rank at the start of the game , and each square has two different names depending on whether it is from white ' s or black ' s point of view . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the square known as " e ##3 " in algebraic notation is " k ##3 " ( king ' s 3rd ) from white ' s point of view , and " k ##6 " ( king ' s 6th ) from black ' s point of view . [SEP]
[CLS] when recording captures , the captured piece is named rather than the square on which it is captured ( except to resolve am ##bi ##gui ##ties ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a few players still prefer descriptive notation , but it is no longer recognized by fide . [SEP]
[CLS] another system is icc ##f nu ##meric notation , recognized by the international correspondence chess federation though its use is in decline . [SEP]
[CLS] squares are identified by nu ##meric coordinates , for example a1 is " 11 " and h ##8 is " 88 " . [SEP]
[CLS] moves are described by the " from " and " to " squares , e . g . the opening move 1 . e [SEP]
[CLS] e ##4 is rendered as 1 . 525 ##4 . [SEP]
[CLS] captures are not indicated . [SEP]
[CLS] cast ##ling is described by the king ' s move only ; e . g . 51 ##7 ##1 for white cast ##ling kings ##ide , 58 ##38 for black cast ##ling queens ##ide . [SEP]
[CLS] a game of chess can generally be loosely subdivided into three phases or stages of play : the " opening " , followed by the " middle ##game " , then last the " end ##game " . [SEP]
[CLS] a chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game ( the " opening moves " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as " openings " and have been given names such as the ru ##y lopez or sicilian defense . [SEP]
[CLS] they are catalogue ##d in reference works such as the " en ##cy ##cl ##opa ##ed ##ia of chess openings " . [SEP]
[CLS] there are dozens of different openings , varying widely in character from quiet position ##al play ( for example , the re ##ti opening ) to very aggressive ( the latvian ga ##mbit ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in some opening lines , the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves . [SEP]
[CLS] professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers , as opening theory continues to evolve . [SEP]
[CLS] most players and theo ##ret ##icia ##ns consider that white , by virtue of the first move , begins the game with a small advantage . [SEP]
[CLS] this initially gives white the initiative . [SEP]
[CLS] black usually strive ##s to neutral ##ize white ' s advantage and achieve equality , or to develop dynamic counter ##play in an un ##balance ##d position . [SEP]
[CLS] the middle ##game is the part of the game which starts after the opening . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no clear line between the opening and the middle ##game , but typically the middle ##game will start when most pieces have been developed . [SEP]
[CLS] ( similarly , there is no clear transition from the middle ##game to the end ##game ; see start of the end ##game . ) [SEP]
[CLS] because the opening theory has ended , players have to form plans based on the features of the position , and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position . [SEP]
[CLS] the middle ##game is the phase in which most combinations occur . [SEP]
[CLS] combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain . [SEP]
[CLS] middle ##game combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent ' s king . [SEP]
[CLS] some typical patterns have their own names ; for example , the bo ##den ' s mate or the las ##ker – bauer combination . [SEP]
[CLS] specific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of openings which result in a specific type of pawn structure . [SEP]
[CLS] an example is the minority attack , which is the attack of queens ##ide pawn ##s against an opponent who has more pawn ##s on the queens ##ide . [SEP]
[CLS] the study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middle ##games . [SEP]
[CLS] another important strategic question in the middle ##game is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an end ##game ( i . e . sim ##plify ) . [SEP]
[CLS] minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an end ##game , and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending . [SEP]
[CLS] not every reduction of material is good for this purpose ; for example , if one side keeps a light - squared bishop and the opponent has a dark - squared one , the transformation into a bishops and pawn ##s ending is usually advantage ##ous for the weaker side only , because an end ##game with bishops on opposite colors is likely to be a draw , even with an advantage of a pawn , or sometimes even with a two - pawn advantage . [SEP]
[CLS] the end ##game ( also " end game " or " ending " ) is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board . [SEP]
[CLS] end ##games can be classified according to the type of pieces remaining on the board . [SEP]
[CLS] basic check ##mates are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can check ##mate the opposing king , with the pieces working together with their king . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , king and pawn end ##games involve only kings and pawn ##s on one or both sides , and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawn ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] other more complicated endings are classified according to pieces on the board other than kings , such as " rook and pawn versus rook " end ##games . [SEP]
[CLS] chess strategy consists of setting and achieving long - term positioning advantages during the game – for example , where to place different pieces – while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver . [SEP]
[CLS] these two aspects of the gameplay cannot be completely separated , because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics , while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play . [SEP]
[CLS] a game of chess is normally divided into three phases : the opening , typically the first 10 moves , when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle ; the middle ##game ; and last the end ##game , when most of the pieces are gone , kings typically take a more active part in the struggle , and pawn promotion is often decisive . [SEP]
[CLS] in chess , tactics in general concentrate on short - term actions – so short - term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player or a computer . [SEP]
[CLS] the possible depth of calculation depends on the player ' s ability . [SEP]
[CLS] in quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides , a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical , while in positions with a limited number of forced variations , strong players can calculate long sequences of moves . [SEP]
[CLS] theo ##ret ##icia ##ns describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers , for example : pins , forks , sk ##ew ##ers , batteries , discovered attacks ( especially discovered checks ) , z ##wi ##schen ##zu ##gs , def ##le ##ctions , deco ##ys , sacrifices , under ##mini ##ng ##s , over ##loading ##s , and interference ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] simple one - move or two - move tactical actions – threats , exchanges of material , and double attacks – can be combined into more complicated sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players . [SEP]
[CLS] a forced variation that involves a sacrifice and usually results in a tangible gain is called a " combination " . [SEP]
[CLS] brilliant combinations – such as those in the immortal game – are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers . [SEP]
[CLS] a common type of chess exercise , aimed at developing players ' skills , is a position where a decisive combination is available and the challenge is to find it . [SEP]
[CLS] chess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long - term plans for the future play . [SEP]
[CLS] during the evaluation , players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board , control of the center and central ##ization , the pawn structure , king safety , and the control of key squares or groups of squares ( for example , diagonal ##s , open files , and dark or light squares ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the total value of pieces of both sides . [SEP]
[CLS] the point values used for this purpose are based on experience ; usually pawn ##s are considered worth one point , knights and bishops about three points each , rook ##s about five points ( the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as the exchange ) , and queens about nine points . [SEP]
[CLS] the king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined , since its check ##mate loses the game . [SEP]
[CLS] but in practical terms , in the end ##game the king as a fighting piece is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook . [SEP]
[CLS] these basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece ( e . g . advanced pawn ##s are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares ) , coordination between pieces ( e . g . a pair of bishops usually coordinate better than a bishop and a knight ) , or the type of position ( e . g . knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawn ##s while bishops are more powerful in open positions ) . [SEP]
[CLS] another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the " pawn structure " ( sometimes known as the " pawn skeleton " ) : the configuration of pawn ##s on the chess ##board . [SEP]
[CLS] since pawn ##s are the least mobile of the pieces , the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position . [SEP]
[CLS] weaknesses in the pawn structure , such as isolated , doubled , or backward pawn ##s and holes , once created , are often permanent . [SEP]
[CLS] care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset ( for example , by the possibility of developing an attack ) . [SEP]
[CLS] contemporary chess is an organized sport with structured international and national leagues , tournaments , and congresses . [SEP]
[CLS] chess ' s international governing body is fide ( federation internationale des ec ##he ##cs ) . [SEP]
[CLS] most countries have a national chess organization as well ( such as the us chess federation and english chess federation ) which in turn is a member of fide . [SEP]
[CLS] fide is a member of the international olympic committee , but the game of chess has never been part of the olympic games ; chess does have its own olympiad , held every two years as a team event . [SEP]
[CLS] the current world chess champion is magnus carl ##sen of norway . [SEP]
[CLS] the reigning women ' s world champion is ho ##u yi ##fan from china . [SEP]
[CLS] the world ' s highest rated female player , ju ##dit pol ##gar , has never participated in the women ' s world chess championship , instead preferring to compete with the leading men and maintaining a ranking among the top male players . [SEP]
[CLS] other competitions for individuals include the world junior chess championship , the european individual chess championship , and the national chess championships . [SEP]
[CLS] invitation - only tournaments regularly attract the world ' s strongest players . [SEP]
[CLS] examples include spain ' s lina ##res event , monte carlo ' s melody amber tournament , the dortmund spark ##asse ##n meeting , sofia ' s m - tel masters , and wi ##jk aa ##n zee ' s tata steel tournament . [SEP]
[CLS] regular team chess events include the chess olympiad and the european team chess championship . [SEP]
[CLS] the world chess solving championship and world correspondence chess championships include both team and individual events . [SEP]
[CLS] besides these prestigious competitions , there are thousands of other chess tournaments , matches , and festivals held around the world every year catering to players of all levels . [SEP]
[CLS] chess is promoted as a " mind sport " by the mind sports organisation , alongside other mental - skill games such as contract bridge , go , and " sc ##ra ##bble " . [SEP]
[CLS] all the titles are open to men and women . [SEP]
[CLS] separate women - only titles , such as woman grandmaster ( w ##gm ) , are available . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning with non ##a gap ##rin ##das ##h ##vili in 1978 , a number of women have earned the gm title , and most of the top ten women in 2006 hold the unrest ##ricted gm title . [SEP]
[CLS] s of 2018 , there are 1725 active grandmaster ##s and 390 ##3 international masters in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] the top three countries with the largest numbers of grandmaster ##s are russia , the united states , and germany , with 251 , 98 , and 96 , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] fide also awards titles for ar ##bit ##ers and trainers . [SEP]
[CLS] international titles are awarded to composers and solve ##rs of chess problems and to correspondence chess players ( by the international correspondence chess federation ) . [SEP]
[CLS] national chess organizations may also award titles , usually to the advanced players still under the level needed for international titles ; an example is the chess expert title used in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to rank players , fide , icc ##f , and national chess organizations use the el ##o rating system developed by ar ##pad el ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] el ##o is a statistical system based on the assumption that the chess performance of each player in his or her games is a random variable . [SEP]
[CLS] ar ##pad el ##o thought of a player ' s true skill as the average of that player ' s performance random variable , and showed how to estimate the average from results of player ' s games . [SEP]
[CLS] the us chess federation implemented el ##o ' s suggestions in 1960 , and the system quickly gained recognition as being both fair ##er and more accurate than older systems ; it was adopted by fide in 1970 . [SEP]
[CLS] a begin ##ner or casual player typically has an el ##o rating of less than 1000 ; an ordinary club player has a rating of about 1500 , a strong club player about 2000 , a grandmaster usually has a rating of over 2500 , and an elite player has a rating of over 270 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] the highest fide rating of all time , 288 ##1 , was achieved by magnus carl ##sen on the march 2014 fide rating list . [SEP]
[CLS] chess composition is the art of creating chess problems ( also called chess compositions ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the creator is known as a chess composer . [SEP]
[CLS] chess composition is a distinct branch of chess sport , and tournaments exist for both the composition and solving of chess problems . [SEP]
[CLS] this is one of the most famous chess studies ; it was published by richard re ##ti 4 december 1921 . [SEP]
[CLS] it seems impossible to catch the advanced black pawn , while the black king can easily stop the white pawn . [SEP]
[CLS] the solution is a diagonal advance , which brings the king to " both " pawn ##s simultaneously : or 2 . . . h ##3 3 . k [SEP]
[CLS] ke ##7 and the white king can support its pawn . [SEP]
[CLS] now the white king comes just in time to support his pawn , or catch the black one . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##f ##4 and white will capture the pawn . [SEP]
[CLS] both sides will queen , resulting in a draw . [SEP]
[CLS] chess has a very extensive literature . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1913 , the chess historian h . j . r . murray estimated the total number of books , magazines , and chess columns in newspapers to be about 5 , 000 . [SEP]
[CLS] b . h . wood estimated the number , as of 1949 , to be about 20 , 000 . [SEP]
[CLS] david hooper and kenneth why ##ld write that , " since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications . [SEP]
[CLS] no one knows how many have been printed . " [SEP]
[CLS] there are two significant public chess libraries : the john g . white chess and check ##ers collection at cleveland public library , with over 32 , 000 chess books and over 6 , 000 bound volumes of chess periodicals ; and the chess & draught ##s collection at the national library of the netherlands , with about 30 , 000 books . [SEP]
[CLS] gm lot ##har sc ##hmi ##d owned the world ' s largest private collection of chess books and memorabilia . [SEP]
[CLS] david del ##uc ##ia ' s chess library contains 7 , 000 to 8 , 000 chess books , a similar number of auto ##graphs ( letters , score sheets , manuscripts ) , and about 1 , 000 items of " ep ##hem ##era " . [SEP]
[CLS] dirk jan ten ge ##uze ##nda ##m op ##ines that del ##uc ##ia ' s collection " is arguably the finest chess collection in the world " . [SEP]
[CLS] the game structure and nature of chess are related to several branches of mathematics . [SEP]
[CLS] many comb ##inator ##ical and topological problems connected to chess have been known for hundreds of years . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be about 10 , and has been proved to be fewer than 10 , with a game - tree complexity of approximately 10 . [SEP]
[CLS] the game - tree complexity of chess was first calculated by claude shannon as 10 , a number known as the shannon number . [SEP]
[CLS] an average position typically has thirty to forty possible moves , but there may be as few as zero ( in the case of check ##mate or stale ##mate ) or ( in a constructed position ) as many as 218 . [SEP]
[CLS] chess has inspired many comb ##inator ##ial puzzles , such as the knight ' s tour and the eight queens puzzle . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea of creating a chess - playing machine dates to the 18th century ; around 1769 , the chess - playing auto ##mat ##on called the turk became famous before being exposed as a hoax . [SEP]
[CLS] serious trials based on auto ##mata , such as el aj ##ed ##re ##cis ##ta , were too complex and limited to be useful . [SEP]
[CLS] since the advent of the digital computer in the 1950s , chess enthusiasts , computer engineers , and computer scientists have built , with increasing degrees of seriousness and success , chess - playing machines and computer programs . [SEP]
[CLS] the groundbreaking paper on computer chess , " programming a computer for playing chess " , was published in 1950 by shannon . [SEP]
[CLS] the chess machine is an ideal one to start with , since : ( 1 ) the problem is sharply defined both in allowed operations ( the moves ) and in the ultimate goal ( check ##mate ) ; ( 2 ) it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution ; ( 3 ) chess is generally considered to require " thinking " for skill ##ful play ; a solution of this problem will force us either to admit the possibility of a mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of " thinking " ; ( 4 ) the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital nature of modern computers . [SEP]
[CLS] the association for computing machinery ( ac ##m ) held the first major chess tournament for computers , the north american computer chess championship , in september 1970 . [SEP]
[CLS] chess 3 . 0 , a chess program from northwestern university , won the championship . [SEP]
[CLS] nowadays , chess programs compete in the world computer chess championship , held annually since 1974 . [SEP]
[CLS] at first considered only a curiosity , the best chess playing programs have become extremely strong . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1997 , a computer won a chess match using classical time controls against a reigning world champion for the first time : ibm ' s deep blue beat garry ka ##spar ##ov 31 ##⁄ ##2 – 21 ##⁄ ##2 ( it scored two wins , one loss , and three draws ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the match was controversial , and computers would only win such a match again in 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2009 , a mobile phone won a category 6 tournament with a performance rating 289 ##8 : chess engine hi ##ar ##cs 13 running on the mobile phone h ##tc touch hd won the copa mer ##cos ##ur tournament with nine wins and one draw . [SEP]
[CLS] the best chess programs are now able to consistently beat the strongest human players , to the extent that human – computer matches no longer attract interest from chess players or media . [SEP]
[CLS] with huge databases of past games and high analytical ability , computers can help players to learn chess and prepare for matches . [SEP]
[CLS] internet chess servers allow people to find and play opponents worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence of computers and modern communication tools have raised concerns regarding cheating during games , most notably the " bathroom controversy " during the 2006 world championship . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1913 , ernst ze ##rm ##elo used chess as a basis for his theory of game strategies , which is considered as one of the predecessors of game theory . [SEP]
[CLS] ze ##rm ##elo ' s theorem states that it is possible to solve chess , i . e . to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game ( either white can force a win , or black can force a win , or both sides can force at least a draw ) . [SEP]
[CLS] according to claude shannon , however , there are 10 legal positions in chess , so it will take an imp ##oss ##ibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology . [SEP]
[CLS] the 11 - category , game theoretical taxonomy of chess includes : two player , no - chance , comb ##inator ##ial , marko ##v state ( present state is all a player needs to move ; although past state led up to that point , knowledge of the sequence of past moves is not required to make the next move , except to take into account of " en pass ##ant " and cast ##ling , which " do " depend on the past moves ) , zero sum , symmetric , perfect information , non - cooperative , discrete , extensive form ( tree decisions , not pay ##off matrices ) , and sequential . [SEP]
[CLS] generalized chess ( played on " n " × " n " board , without the fifty - move rule ) is ex ##pt ##ime - complete . [SEP]
[CLS] some applications of comb ##inator ##ial game theory to chess end ##games were found by elk ##ies ( 1996 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology . [SEP]
[CLS] alfred bin ##et and others showed that knowledge and verbal , rather than vis ##uo ##sp ##ati ##al , ability lies at the core of expertise . [SEP]
[CLS] in his doctoral thesis , ad ##ria ##an de gr ##oot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position . [SEP]
[CLS] according to de gr ##oot , this perception , made possible by years of practice and study , is more important than the sheer ability to anti ##ci ##pate moves . [SEP]
[CLS] de gr ##oot showed that chess masters can memo ##rize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly . [SEP]
[CLS] the ability to memo ##rize does not alone account for chess - playing skill , since masters and novice ##s , when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces , had equivalent recall ( about six positions in each case ) . [SEP]
[CLS] rather , it is the ability to recognize patterns , which are then memo ##rized , which distinguished the skilled players from the novice ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] when the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game , the masters had almost total position ##al recall . [SEP]
[CLS] more recent research has focused on chess as mental training ; the respective roles of knowledge and look - ahead search ; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novice ##s ; blind ##fold chess ; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill ; gender differences ; and computational models of chess expertise . [SEP]
[CLS] the role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much recent research . [SEP]
[CLS] eric ##sson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess . [SEP]
[CLS] recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , fern ##and go ##bet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the northern hemisphere are more likely to have been born in late winter and early spring . [SEP]
