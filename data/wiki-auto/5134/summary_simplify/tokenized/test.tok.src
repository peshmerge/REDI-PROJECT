[CLS] the pieces assumed their current powers in spain in the late 15th century ; the modern rules were standardized in the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] the objective is to check ##mate the opponent ' s king by placing it under an in ##es ##cap ##able threat of capture . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to check ##mate , a player wins the game if the opponent resign ##s , or ( in a timed game ) runs out of time . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also several ways that a game can end in a draw . [SEP]
[CLS] since 1948 , the world championship has been regulated by the federation internationale des ec ##he ##cs ( fide ) , the game ' s international governing body . [SEP]
[CLS] fide is a member of the international olympic committee , which can be considered recognition of chess as a sport . [SEP]
[CLS] online chess has opened amateur and professional competition to a wide and varied group of players . [SEP]
[CLS] since the second half of the 20th century , chess engines have been programmed to play with increasing success , to the point where the strongest programs play at a higher level than the best human players . [SEP]
[CLS] since the 1990s , computer analysis has contributed significantly to chess theory , particularly in the end ##game . [SEP]
[CLS] the ibm computer deep blue was the first machine to overcome a reigning world chess champion in a match when it defeated garry ka ##spar ##ov in 1997 . [SEP]
[CLS] one of these , chess ##9 ##60 , has gained widespread popularity as well as some fide recognition . [SEP]
[CLS] the rules of chess are published by fide ( " federation internationale des ec ##he ##cs " ) , chess ' s international governing body , in its " handbook " . [SEP]
[CLS] the pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo . [SEP]
[CLS] in competitive games , the colors are allocated by the organizers ; in informal games , the colors are usually decided randomly , for example by coin toss , or by one player ' s conceal ##ing a white and black pawn in either hand and having the opponent choose . [SEP]
[CLS] white moves first , after which players alternate turns , moving one piece per turn ( except for cast ##ling , when two pieces are moved ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a player may not make any move that would put or leave the player ' s own king in check . [SEP]
[CLS] if the player to move has no legal move , the game is over ; the result is either check ##mate ( a loss for the player with no legal move ) if the king is in check , or stale ##mate ( a draw ) if the king is not . [SEP]
[CLS] in the diagrams , the dots mark the squares to which the piece can move if there are no intervening piece ( s ) of either color ( except the knight , which leaps over any intervening pieces ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this can be done only on the very next turn ; otherwise the right to do so is for ##feit ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] when a pawn advances to the eighth rank , as a part of the move it is " promoted " and must be exchanged for the player ' s choice of queen , rook , bishop , or knight of the same color . [SEP]
[CLS] usually , the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen , but in some cases another piece is chosen ; this is called under ##pro ##mot ##ion . [SEP]
[CLS] in the animated diagram , the pawn on c ##7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no restriction on the piece promoted to , so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game ( e . g . , two or more queens ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent ' s pieces , it is said to be " in check " . [SEP]
[CLS] a move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in check . [SEP]
[CLS] this can involve capturing the checking piece ; inter ##po ##sing a piece between the checking piece and the king ( which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen , rook , or bishop and there is a square between it and the king ) ; or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack . [SEP]
[CLS] cast ##ling is not a per ##missible response to a check . [SEP]
[CLS] the object of the game is to check ##mate the opponent ; this occurs when the opponent ' s king is in check , and there is no legal way to remove it from attack . [SEP]
[CLS] it is never legal for a player to make a move that puts or leaves the player ' s own king in check . [SEP]
[CLS] in competition , chess games are played with a time control . [SEP]
[CLS] if a player ' s time runs out before the game is completed , the game is automatically lost ( provided the opponent has enough pieces left to deliver check ##mate ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the duration of a game ranges from long ( or " classical " ) games which can take up to seven hours ( even longer if ad ##jou ##rn ##ments are permitted ) to bullet chess ( under 3 minutes per player for the entire game ) . [SEP]
[CLS] intermediate between these are rapid chess games , lasting between 20 minutes and two hours per game , a popular time control in amateur weekend tournaments . [SEP]
[CLS] time is controlled using a chess clock that has two displays , one for each player ' s remaining time . [SEP]
[CLS] chess is believed to have originated in eastern india , 280 – 550 , in the gupta empire , where its early form in the 6th century was known as " chat ##ura ##nga " , literally " four divisions " of the military – infantry , cavalry , elephants , and chariot ##ry , represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn , knight , bishop , and rook , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] thence it spread eastward and westward along the silk road . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest evidence of chess is found in the nearby sas ##san ##id persia around 600 , where the game came to be known by the name " chat ##rang " . [SEP]
[CLS] chat ##rang was taken up by the muslim world after the islamic conquest of persia ( 63 ##3 – 44 ) , where it was then named " sha ##tra ##n ##j " , with the pieces largely retaining their persian names . [SEP]
[CLS] the oldest archaeological chess artifacts , ivory pieces , were excavated in ancient af ##rasia ##b , today ' s sam ##ark ##and , in uzbekistan , central asia , and date to about 760 , with some of them possibly older . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a lost manuscript , but referenced in later works . [SEP]
[CLS] the eastern migration of chess , into china and southeast asia , has even less documentation than its migration west . [SEP]
[CLS] the first reference to chinese chess , called " xiang ##qi " , appears in a book entitled " xu ##an gu ##ai lu " ( " record of the mysterious and strange " ) , dating to about 800 . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatively , some contend that chess arose from chinese chess or one of its predecessors , although this has been contested . [SEP]
[CLS] a latin poem " de sc ##achi ##s " dated to the late 10th century has been preserved in ein ##sie ##del ##n abbey . [SEP]
[CLS] around 1200 , the rules of sha ##tra ##n ##j started to be modified in southern europe , and around 147 ##5 , several major changes made the game essentially as it is known today . [SEP]
[CLS] these modern rules for the basic moves had been adopted in italy and spain . [SEP]
[CLS] pawn ##s gained the option of advancing two squares on their first move , while bishops and queens acquired their modern abilities . [SEP]
[CLS] the queen replaced the earlier viz ##ier chess piece towards the end of the 10th century and by the 15th century had become the most powerful piece ; consequently modern chess was referred to as " queen ' s chess " or " mad queen chess " . [SEP]
[CLS] cast ##ling , derived from the " kings leap " usually in combination with a pawn or rook move to bring the king to safety , was introduced . [SEP]
[CLS] writings about the theory of how to play chess began to appear in the 15th century . [SEP]
[CLS] the " rep ##etic ##ion de amore ##s y arte de aj ##ed ##re ##z " ( " repetition of love and the art of playing chess " ) by spanish church ##man luis ramirez de luce ##na was published in salamanca in 149 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] luce ##na and later masters like portuguese pedro damian ##o , italians giovanni leonardo di bon ##a , gi ##ulio cesare pole ##rio and gi ##oa ##chin ##o greco , and spanish bishop ru ##y lopez de se ##gur ##a developed elements of openings and started to analyze simple end ##games . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 18th century , the center of european chess life moved from the southern european countries to france . [SEP]
[CLS] the two most important french masters were francois - andre dani ##can phil ##ido ##r , a musician by profession , who discovered the importance of pawn ##s for chess strategy , and later louis - charles ma ##he de la bo ##ur ##don ##nais , who won a famous series of matches with the irish master alexander mcdonnell in 1834 . [SEP]
[CLS] centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in major european cities like " cafe de la reg ##ence " in paris and " simpson ' s diva ##n " in london . [SEP]
[CLS] also in the 19th century , the convention that white moves first was established ( formerly either white or black could move first ) . [SEP]
[CLS] finally the rules around cast ##ling were standardized – variations in the cast ##ling rules had persisted in italy until the late 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] the resulting standard game is sometimes referred to as " western chess " or " international chess " , particularly in asia where other games of the chess family such as xiang ##qi are prevalent . [SEP]
[CLS] since the 19th century , the only rule changes have been technical in nature , for example establishing the correct procedure for claiming a draw by repetition . [SEP]
[CLS] there were correspondence matches between cities ; for example , the london chess club played against the edinburgh chess club in 1824 . [SEP]
[CLS] chess problems became a regular part of 19th - century newspapers ; bernhard ho ##r ##witz , josef k ##ling , and samuel lo ##yd composed some of the most influential problems . [SEP]
[CLS] the first modern chess tournament was organized by howard st ##au ##nton , a leading english chess player , and was held in london in 1851 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was won by the german adolf anders ##sen , who was hailed as the leading chess master . [SEP]
[CLS] his brilliant , energetic attacking style was typical for the time . [SEP]
[CLS] a profound belief that chess merit resided in the players ' genius rather than inherent in the position on the board per ##va ##ded chess practice . [SEP]
[CLS] deeper insight into the nature of chess came with the american paul mor ##phy , an extraordinary chess prodigy . [SEP]
[CLS] mor ##phy won against all important competitors ( except st ##au ##nton , who refused to play ) , including anders ##sen , during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863 . [SEP]
[CLS] mor ##phy ' s success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy ; he intuitive ##ly knew how to prepare attacks . [SEP]
[CLS] before stein ##itz , players brought their queen out early , did not completely develop their other pieces , and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king , which either succeeded or failed . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to his theoretical achievements , stein ##itz founded an important tradition : his triumph over the leading german master johannes zu ##ker ##tort in 1886 is regarded as the first official world chess championship . [SEP]
[CLS] stein ##itz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player , the german mathematician emanuel las ##ker , who maintained this title for 27 years , the longest tenure of any world champion . [SEP]
[CLS] after the end of the 19th century , the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew . [SEP]
[CLS] the tradition of awarding such titles was continued by the world chess federation ( fide ) , founded in 1924 in paris . [SEP]
[CLS] it took a prodigy from cuba , jose raul cap ##ab ##lan ##ca ( world champion 1921 – 1927 ) , who loved simple positions and end ##games , to end the german - speaking dominance in chess ; he was undefeated in tournament play for eight years , until 1924 . [SEP]
[CLS] his successor was russian - french alexander ale ##kh ##ine , a strong attacking player who died as the world champion in 1946 . [SEP]
[CLS] he briefly lost the title to dutch player max eu ##we in 1935 and regained it two years later . [SEP]
[CLS] between the world wars , chess was revolution ##ized by the new theoretical school of so - called hyper ##mo ##dern ##ists like ar ##on ni ##m ##zow ##its ##ch and richard re ##ti . [SEP]
[CLS] they advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawn ##s , thus inviting opponents to occupy the center with pawn ##s , which become objects of attack . [SEP]
[CLS] fide , which has controlled the title since then ( except for one interruption ) , ran a tournament of elite players . [SEP]
[CLS] the winner of the 1948 tournament , russian mikhail bot ##vin ##nik , started an era of soviet dominance in the chess world . [SEP]
[CLS] in the previous informal system of world championships , the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match . [SEP]
[CLS] the leading finish ##ers in these inter ##zon ##als would go on the " candidates " stage , which was initially a tournament , and later a series of knockout matches . [SEP]
[CLS] the winner of the candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title . [SEP]
[CLS] following the 1961 event , fide abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch , and the next champion , armenian ti ##gra ##n pet ##ros ##ian , a player renowned for his defensive and position ##al skills , held the title for two cycles , 1963 – 1969 . [SEP]
[CLS] the next championship , the so - called match of the century , saw the first non - soviet challenger since world war ii , american bobby fischer , who defeated his candidates opponents by un ##heard - of margins and clearly won the world championship match . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1975 , however , fischer refused to defend his title against soviet ana ##to ##ly ka ##rp ##ov when fide did not meet his demands , and ka ##rp ##ov obtained the title by default . [SEP]
[CLS] ka ##rp ##ov defended his title twice against viktor ko ##rch ##no ##i and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a string of tournament successes . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1993 , garry ka ##spar ##ov and nigel short broke with fide to organize their own match for the title and formed a competing professional chess association ( pc ##a ) . [SEP]
[CLS] from then until 2006 , there were two simultaneous world champions and world championships : the pc ##a or classical champion extending the stein ##itz ##ian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of many games , and the other following fide ' s new format of many players competing in a tournament to determine the champion . [SEP]
[CLS] the world chess championship 2006 , in which k ##ram ##nik beat the fide world champion ve ##sel ##in top ##alo ##v , re ##uni ##fied the titles and made k ##ram ##nik the und ##is ##puted world chess champion . [SEP]
[CLS] carl ##sen confirmed his title in 2016 against the russian sergey ka ##r ##jak ##in and in 2018 against the american fabian ##o car ##uan ##a , in both occasions by a rapid tie ##breaker match after equality in 12 games of classical time control , and is the reigning world champion . [SEP]
[CLS] in the middle ages and during the renaissance , chess was a part of noble culture ; it was used to teach war strategy and was dubbed the " king ' s game " . [SEP]
[CLS] gentlemen are " to be mean ##ly seen ##e in the play at chest ##es " , says the overview at the beginning of bald ##ass ##are cast ##ig ##lion ##e ' s " the book of the court ##ier " ( 152 ##8 , english 156 ##1 by sir thomas ho ##by ) , but chess should not be a gentleman ' s main passion . [SEP]
[CLS] but me think it hat ##h a fault , which ##e is , that a man may be to co ##uni ##ng at it , for who ever will be excellent in the play ##e of chest ##es , i bel ##ea ##ve he must bees ##tow ##e much ty ##me about it , and app ##lie it with so much study , that a man may ass ##oon ##e learn ##e some noble sc ##yen ##ce , or com ##pas ##e any other matter of import ##au ##nce , and yet in the end ##e in bees ##tow ##ing all that labour ##e , he know ##eth no more but a game . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the elaborate chess sets used by the aristocracy have been lost , but others partially survive , such as the lewis chess ##men . [SEP]
[CLS] the work was translated into many other languages ( the first printed edition was published at utrecht in 147 ##3 ) and was the basis for william ca ##xton ' s " the game and play ##e of the chess ##e " ( 147 ##4 ) , one of the first books printed in english . [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] known in the circles of cleric ##s , students , and merchants , chess entered into the popular culture of middle ages . [SEP]
[CLS] an example is the 209 ##th song of car ##mina bu ##rana from the 13th century , which starts with the names of chess pieces , " roc ##h , pe ##dit ##es , regina . . . " [SEP]
[CLS] during the age of enlightenment , chess was viewed as a means of self - improvement . [SEP]
[CLS] benjamin franklin , in his article " the morals of chess " ( 1750 ) , wrote : the game of chess is not merely an idle amusement ; several very valuable qualities of the mind , useful in the course of human life , are to be acquired and strengthened by it , so as to become habits ready on all occasions ; for life is a kind of chess , in which we have often points to gain , and competitors or ad ##vers ##aries to contend with , and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events , that are , in some degree , the effect of pr ##udence , or the want of it . [SEP]

[CLS] ci ##rc ##ums ##pe ##ction , which surveys the whole chess - board , or scene of action : – the relation of the several pieces , and their situations . . . [SEP]
[CLS] tournaments are held regularly in many countries , hosted by organizations such as the united states chess federation and the national scholastic chess foundation . [SEP]
[CLS] chess is often depicted in the arts ; significant works where chess plays a key role range from thomas middleton ' s " a game at chess " to " through the looking - glass " by lewis carroll , to vladimir na ##bo ##kov ' s " the defense " , to " the royal game " by stefan z ##weig . [SEP]
[CLS] chess is featured in films like ing ##mar bergman ' s " the seventh seal " and sat ##ya ##jit ray ' s " the chess players " . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the characters in " star trek " play a futuristic version of the game called " tri - dimensional chess " . [SEP]
[CLS] chess is used as the core theme in the musical " chess " by tim rice , bjorn ul ##va ##eus , and benny andersson . [SEP]
[CLS] the thriller film " knight moves " is about a chess grandmaster who is accused of being a serial killer . [SEP]
[CLS] " pawn sacrifice " , starring to ##bey maguire as bobby fischer and lie ##v sc ##hre ##ibe ##r as boris spa ##ss ##ky , depicts the drama surrounding the 1972 world chess championship in iceland during the cold war . [SEP]
[CLS] this fat ##wa is not legally binding , however , and chess remains a popular game in muslim countries . [SEP]
[CLS] chess games and positions are recorded using a system of notation , most commonly algebraic chess notation . [SEP]
[CLS] chess literature published in other languages may use different initials for pieces , or fig ##uri ##ne algebraic notation ( fan ) may be used to avoid language issues . [SEP]
[CLS] to resolve am ##bi ##gui ##ties , an additional letter or number is added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] when a pawn makes a capture , the file from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial , and ranks may be omitted if una ##mb ##ig ##uous . [SEP]
[CLS] if a pawn moves to its last rank , achieving promotion , the piece chosen is indicated after the move ( for example , e ##1 ##q or e ##1 = q ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a move that places the opponent ' s king in check usually has the notation " + " added ( the notation " + + " for a double check is considered obsolete ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the text - based portable game notation ( pg ##n ) , which is understood by chess software , is based on short form english language algebraic notation . [SEP]
[CLS] in descriptive notation , files are named according to the piece which occupies the back rank at the start of the game , and each square has two different names depending on whether it is from white ' s or black ' s point of view . [SEP]
[CLS] when recording captures , the captured piece is named rather than the square on which it is captured ( except to resolve am ##bi ##gui ##ties ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a few players still prefer descriptive notation , but it is no longer recognized by fide . [SEP]
[CLS] recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as " openings " and have been given names such as the ru ##y lopez or sicilian defense . [SEP]
[CLS] they are catalogue ##d in reference works such as the " en ##cy ##cl ##opa ##ed ##ia of chess openings " . [SEP]
[CLS] there are dozens of different openings , varying widely in character from quiet position ##al play ( for example , the re ##ti opening ) to very aggressive ( the latvian ga ##mbit ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in some opening lines , the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves . [SEP]
[CLS] most players and theo ##ret ##icia ##ns consider that white , by virtue of the first move , begins the game with a small advantage . [SEP]
[CLS] ( similarly , there is no clear transition from the middle ##game to the end ##game ; see start of the end ##game . ) [SEP]
[CLS] because the opening theory has ended , players have to form plans based on the features of the position , and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position . [SEP]
[CLS] some typical patterns have their own names ; for example , the bo ##den ' s mate or the las ##ker – bauer combination . [SEP]
[CLS] an example is the minority attack , which is the attack of queens ##ide pawn ##s against an opponent who has more pawn ##s on the queens ##ide . [SEP]
[CLS] the study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middle ##games . [SEP]
[CLS] another important strategic question in the middle ##game is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an end ##game ( i . e . [SEP]
[CLS] minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an end ##game , and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending . [SEP]
[CLS] not every reduction of material is good for this purpose ; for example , if one side keeps a light - squared bishop and the opponent has a dark - squared one , the transformation into a bishops and pawn ##s ending is usually advantage ##ous for the weaker side only , because an end ##game with bishops on opposite colors is likely to be a draw , even with an advantage of a pawn , or sometimes even with a two - pawn advantage . [SEP]
[CLS] end ##games can be classified according to the type of pieces remaining on the board . [SEP]
[CLS] basic check ##mates are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can check ##mate the opposing king , with the pieces working together with their king . [SEP]
[CLS] other more complicated endings are classified according to pieces on the board other than kings , such as " rook and pawn versus rook " end ##games . [SEP]
[CLS] chess strategy consists of setting and achieving long - term positioning advantages during the game – for example , where to place different pieces – while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver . [SEP]
[CLS] these two aspects of the gameplay cannot be completely separated , because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics , while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play . [SEP]
[CLS] a game of chess is normally divided into three phases : the opening , typically the first 10 moves , when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle ; the middle ##game ; and last the end ##game , when most of the pieces are gone , kings typically take a more active part in the struggle , and pawn promotion is often decisive . [SEP]
[CLS] in chess , tactics in general concentrate on short - term actions – so short - term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player or a computer . [SEP]
[CLS] in quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides , a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical , while in positions with a limited number of forced variations , strong players can calculate long sequences of moves . [SEP]
[CLS] simple one - move or two - move tactical actions – threats , exchanges of material , and double attacks – can be combined into more complicated sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players . [SEP]
[CLS] brilliant combinations – such as those in the immortal game – are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers . [SEP]
[CLS] a common type of chess exercise , aimed at developing players ' skills , is a position where a decisive combination is available and the challenge is to find it . [SEP]
[CLS] chess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long - term plans for the future play . [SEP]
[CLS] during the evaluation , players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board , control of the center and central ##ization , the pawn structure , king safety , and the control of key squares or groups of squares ( for example , diagonal ##s , open files , and dark or light squares ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the point values used for this purpose are based on experience ; usually pawn ##s are considered worth one point , knights and bishops about three points each , rook ##s about five points ( the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as the exchange ) , and queens about nine points . [SEP]
[CLS] the king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined , since its check ##mate loses the game . [SEP]
[CLS] but in practical terms , in the end ##game the king as a fighting piece is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook . [SEP]
[CLS] these basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] advanced pawn ##s are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares ) , coordination between pieces ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawn ##s while bishops are more powerful in open positions ) . [SEP]
[CLS] another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the " pawn structure " ( sometimes known as the " pawn skeleton " ) : the configuration of pawn ##s on the chess ##board . [SEP]
[CLS] since pawn ##s are the least mobile of the pieces , the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position . [SEP]
[CLS] weaknesses in the pawn structure , such as isolated , doubled , or backward pawn ##s and holes , once created , are often permanent . [SEP]
[CLS] care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset ( for example , by the possibility of developing an attack ) . [SEP]
[CLS] most countries have a national chess organization as well ( such as the us chess federation and english chess federation ) which in turn is a member of fide . [SEP]
[CLS] fide is a member of the international olympic committee , but the game of chess has never been part of the olympic games ; chess does have its own olympiad , held every two years as a team event . [SEP]
[CLS] the world ' s highest rated female player , ju ##dit pol ##gar , has never participated in the women ' s world chess championship , instead preferring to compete with the leading men and maintaining a ranking among the top male players . [SEP]
[CLS] besides these prestigious competitions , there are thousands of other chess tournaments , matches , and festivals held around the world every year catering to players of all levels . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning with non ##a gap ##rin ##das ##h ##vili in 1978 , a number of women have earned the gm title , and most of the top ten women in 2006 hold the unrest ##ricted gm title . [SEP]
[CLS] the top three countries with the largest numbers of grandmaster ##s are russia , the united states , and germany , with 251 , 98 , and 96 , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] national chess organizations may also award titles , usually to the advanced players still under the level needed for international titles ; an example is the chess expert title used in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to rank players , fide , icc ##f , and national chess organizations use the el ##o rating system developed by ar ##pad el ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] el ##o is a statistical system based on the assumption that the chess performance of each player in his or her games is a random variable . [SEP]
[CLS] the us chess federation implemented el ##o ' s suggestions in 1960 , and the system quickly gained recognition as being both fair ##er and more accurate than older systems ; it was adopted by fide in 1970 . [SEP]
[CLS] the highest fide rating of all time , 288 ##1 , was achieved by magnus carl ##sen on the march 2014 fide rating list . [SEP]
[CLS] david hooper and kenneth why ##ld write that , " since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications . [SEP]
[CLS] there are two significant public chess libraries : the john g . white chess and check ##ers collection at cleveland public library , with over 32 , 000 chess books and over 6 , 000 bound volumes of chess periodicals ; and the chess & draught ##s collection at the national library of the netherlands , with about 30 , 000 books . [SEP]
[CLS] dirk jan ten ge ##uze ##nda ##m op ##ines that del ##uc ##ia ' s collection " is arguably the finest chess collection in the world " . [SEP]
[CLS] many comb ##inator ##ical and topological problems connected to chess have been known for hundreds of years . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be about 10 , and has been proved to be fewer than 10 , with a game - tree complexity of approximately 10 . [SEP]
[CLS] the game - tree complexity of chess was first calculated by claude shannon as 10 , a number known as the shannon number . [SEP]
[CLS] an average position typically has thirty to forty possible moves , but there may be as few as zero ( in the case of check ##mate or stale ##mate ) or ( in a constructed position ) as many as 218 . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea of creating a chess - playing machine dates to the 18th century ; around 1769 , the chess - playing auto ##mat ##on called the turk became famous before being exposed as a hoax . [SEP]
[CLS] since the advent of the digital computer in the 1950s , chess enthusiasts , computer engineers , and computer scientists have built , with increasing degrees of seriousness and success , chess - playing machines and computer programs . [SEP]
[CLS] the chess machine is an ideal one to start with , since : ( 1 ) the problem is sharply defined both in allowed operations ( the moves ) and in the ultimate goal ( check ##mate ) ; ( 2 ) it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution ; ( 3 ) chess is generally considered to require " thinking " for skill ##ful play ; a solution of this problem will force us either to admit the possibility of a mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of " thinking " ; ( 4 ) the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital nature of modern computers . [SEP]
[CLS] at first considered only a curiosity , the best chess playing programs have become extremely strong . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1997 , a computer won a chess match using classical time controls against a reigning world champion for the first time : ibm ' s deep blue beat garry ka ##spar ##ov 31 ##⁄ ##2 – 21 ##⁄ ##2 ( it scored two wins , one loss , and three draws ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2009 , a mobile phone won a category 6 tournament with a performance rating 289 ##8 : chess engine hi ##ar ##cs 13 running on the mobile phone h ##tc touch hd won the copa mer ##cos ##ur tournament with nine wins and one draw . [SEP]
[CLS] the best chess programs are now able to consistently beat the strongest human players , to the extent that human – computer matches no longer attract interest from chess players or media . [SEP]
[CLS] with huge databases of past games and high analytical ability , computers can help players to learn chess and prepare for matches . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence of computers and modern communication tools have raised concerns regarding cheating during games , most notably the " bathroom controversy " during the 2006 world championship . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1913 , ernst ze ##rm ##elo used chess as a basis for his theory of game strategies , which is considered as one of the predecessors of game theory . [SEP]
[CLS] to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game ( either white can force a win , or black can force a win , or both sides can force at least a draw ) . [SEP]
[CLS] according to claude shannon , however , there are 10 legal positions in chess , so it will take an imp ##oss ##ibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology . [SEP]
[CLS] the 11 - category , game theoretical taxonomy of chess includes : two player , no - chance , comb ##inator ##ial , marko ##v state ( present state is all a player needs to move ; although past state led up to that point , knowledge of the sequence of past moves is not required to make the next move , except to take into account of " en pass ##ant " and cast ##ling , which " do " depend on the past moves ) , zero sum , symmetric , perfect information , non - cooperative , discrete , extensive form ( tree decisions , not pay ##off matrices ) , and sequential . [SEP]
[CLS] some applications of comb ##inator ##ial game theory to chess end ##games were found by elk ##ies ( 1996 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] alfred bin ##et and others showed that knowledge and verbal , rather than vis ##uo ##sp ##ati ##al , ability lies at the core of expertise . [SEP]
[CLS] in his doctoral thesis , ad ##ria ##an de gr ##oot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position . [SEP]
[CLS] according to de gr ##oot , this perception , made possible by years of practice and study , is more important than the sheer ability to anti ##ci ##pate moves . [SEP]
[CLS] de gr ##oot showed that chess masters can memo ##rize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly . [SEP]
[CLS] the ability to memo ##rize does not alone account for chess - playing skill , since masters and novice ##s , when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces , had equivalent recall ( about six positions in each case ) . [SEP]
[CLS] rather , it is the ability to recognize patterns , which are then memo ##rized , which distinguished the skilled players from the novice ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] when the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game , the masters had almost total position ##al recall . [SEP]
[CLS] more recent research has focused on chess as mental training ; the respective roles of knowledge and look - ahead search ; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novice ##s ; blind ##fold chess ; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill ; gender differences ; and computational models of chess expertise . [SEP]
[CLS] the role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much recent research . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , fern ##and go ##bet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the northern hemisphere are more likely to have been born in late winter and early spring . [SEP]
[CLS] compared to general population , chess players are more likely to be non - right - handed , though they found no correlation between handed ##ness and skill . [SEP]
[CLS] academic opinion has long been split on how strong the relationship is , with some studies finding no relationship and others finding a relatively strong one . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2016 meta - analysis and review based on 19 studies and a total sample size of 1 , 77 ##9 found that various aspects of general intelligence co ##rre ##late with chess skill , with average correlation ##s ranging from 0 . 13 ( vis ##uo ##sp ##ati ##al ability ) to 0 . 35 ( numerical ability ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the review did not find strong evidence of publication bias bias ##ing these estimates . [SEP]
[CLS] prime sources in english describing chess variants and their rules include david pri ##tch ##ard ' s encyclopedia ##s , the website " the chess variant pages " created by hans bo ##dl ##ae ##nder with various contributors , and the magazine " variant chess " published from 1990 ( george je ##llis ) to 2010 ( the british chess variants society ) .
