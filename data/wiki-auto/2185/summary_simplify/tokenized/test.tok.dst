[CLS] the mt ##dna ha ##pl ##og ##roup j has been observed at notable frequencies among overall populations in the arab world . [SEP]
[CLS] the maternal clade r ##0 reaches its highest frequency in the arabian peninsula , while k and t ( specifically sub ##cl ##ade t ##2 ) is more common in the levant . [SEP]
[CLS] there are four principal west eurasian auto ##som ##al dna components that character ##ize the populations in the arab world : the arabian , levant ##ine , coptic and mag ##hre ##bi components . [SEP]
[CLS] the arabian component is the main auto ##som ##al element in the persian gulf region . [SEP]
[CLS] the geographical distribution pattern of this component co ##rre ##lates with the pattern of the islamic expansion , but its presence in lebanese christians , sep ##hard ##i and ash ##ken ##azi jews , cypriot ##s and armenians might suggest that its spread to the levant could also represent an earlier event . [SEP]
[CLS] the levant ##ine component is the main auto ##som ##al element in the near east and caucasus . [SEP]
[CLS] the coptic component is the main auto ##som ##al element in northeast africa . [SEP]
[CLS] it peaks among egyptian cop ##ts in sudan , and is also found at high frequencies among other afro - asiatic - speaking populations in the nile valley and the horn of africa . [SEP]
[CLS] the mag ##hre ##bi component diver ##ged from the coptic / et ##hi ##o - somali , arabian and levant ##ine components prior to the ho ##lo ##cene . [SEP]
[CLS] a recent genetic study published in the " " european journal of human genetics " " in nature ( 2019 ) showed that west asian ##s ( arabs ) are closely related to europeans and northern africans as well as to southwest asian ##s . [SEP]
