The mtDNA haplogroup J has been observed at notable frequencies among overall populations in the Arab world.
The maternal clade R0 reaches its highest frequency in the Arabian peninsula, while K and T(specifically subclade T2) is more common in the Levant.
There are four principal West Eurasian autosomal DNA components that characterize the populations in the Arab world: the Arabian, Levantine, Coptic and Maghrebi components.
The Arabian component is the main autosomal element in the Persian Gulf region.
The geographical distribution pattern of this component correlates with the pattern of the Islamic expansion, but its presence in Lebanese Christians, Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews, Cypriots and Armenians might suggest that its spread to the Levant could also represent an earlier event.
The Levantine component is the main autosomal element in the Near East and Caucasus.
The Coptic component is the main autosomal element in Northeast Africa.
It peaks among Egyptian Copts in Sudan, and is also found at high frequencies among other Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the Nile Valley and the Horn of Africa.
The Maghrebi component diverged from the Coptic/Ethio-Somali, Arabian and Levantine components prior to the Holocene.
A recent genetic study published in the ""European Journal of Human Genetics"" in Nature (2019) showed that West Asians (Arabs) are closely related to Europeans and Northern Africans as well as to Southwest Asians.
