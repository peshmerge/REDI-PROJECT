the mtdna haplogroup j has been observed at notable frequencies among overall populations in the arab world .
the maternal clade r0 reaches its highest frequency in the arabian peninsula .
in the nile valley and horn of africa , haplogroups n1 and m1 ; in the maghreb , haplogroups h1 and u6 are more significant .
there are four main west eurasian dna components that characterize the populations in the arab world : the arabian , levantine , coptic and maghrebi components .
the arabian component is the main autosomal element in the persian gulf region .
it is closely related to arabic-speaking populations .
the arabian component is also found in parts of the levant and northeast africa .
the geographical distribution pattern of this component correlates with the pattern of the islamic expansion , but its presence in lebanese christians , sephardi and ashkenazi jews , cypriots and armenians might suggest that its spread to the levant could also represent an earlier event .
the levantine component is the main autosomal element in the near east and caucasus .
it peaks among druze populations in the levant .
the levantine component diverged from the arabian component about 15,500 â€“ 23,700 ypb .
the coptic component is the main autosomal element in northeast africa .
it peaks among egyptian copts in sudan .
the coptic component is roughly equivalent with the ethio-somali component .
maghrebi is the main autosomal element in the maghreb .
it peaks among the non-arabized berber populations in the region .
the maghrebi component diverged from the coptic / ethio-somali , arabian and levantine parts before the holocene .
recent genetic study in the " european journal of human genetics " in naturekovsky showed that west asians pmid are closely related to europeans and northern africans as well as to southwest asians .
