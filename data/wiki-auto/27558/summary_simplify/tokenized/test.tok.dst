[CLS] salts are composed of related numbers of cat ##ions ( positively charged ions ) and an ##ions ( negative ions ) so that the product is electrically neutral ( without a net charge ) . [SEP]
[CLS] salts that produce hydro ##xide ions when dissolved in water are called " al ##kali salts " . [SEP]
[CLS] " neutral salts " are those salts that are neither acidic nor basic . [SEP]
[CLS] z ##wi ##tter ##ions contain an an ##ion ##ic and a cat ##ion ##ic centres in the same molecule , but are not considered to be salts . [SEP]
[CLS] solid salts tend to be transparent as illustrated by sodium chloride . [SEP]
[CLS] in many cases , the apparent op ##ac ##ity or transparency are only related to the difference in size of the individual mono ##cr ##yst ##als . [SEP]
[CLS] since light reflects from the grain boundaries ( boundaries between crystal ##lite ##s ) , larger crystals tend to be transparent , while the poly ##cr ##yst ##all ##ine aggregate ##s look like white powder ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] salts exist in many different colors , which arise either from the an ##ions or cat ##ions . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly inorganic pigment ##s tend not to be salts , because ins ##ol ##ub ##ility is required for fast ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] some organic dye ##s are salts , but they are virtually ins ##ol ##ub ##le in water . [SEP]
[CLS] different salts can eli ##cit all five basic tastes , e . g . , salty ( sodium chloride ) , sweet ( lead dia ##ce ##tate , which will cause lead poisoning if ing ##ested ) , sour ( potassium bit ##art ##rate ) , bitter ( magnesium sulfate ) , and um ##ami or sa ##vor ##y ( mono ##so ##dium g ##lu ##tama ##te ) . [SEP]
[CLS] salts of strong acids and strong bases ( " strong salts " ) are non - volatile and often odor ##less , whereas salts of either weak acids or weak bases ( " weak salts " ) may smell like the con ##ju ##gate acid ( e . g . , ace ##tate ##s like ace ##tic acid ( vinegar ) and cy ##ani ##des like hydrogen cy ##ani ##de ( almond ##s ) ) or the con ##ju ##gate base ( e . g . , am ##monium salts like ammonia ) of the component ions . [SEP]
[CLS] that slow , partial decomposition is usually accelerated by the presence of water , since hydro ##lysis is the other half of the rev ##ers ##ible reaction equation of formation of weak salts . [SEP]
[CLS] many ionic compounds exhibit significant sol ##ub ##ility in water or other polar solvent ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the sol ##ub ##ility is dependent on how well each ion interact ##s with the solvent , so certain patterns become apparent . [SEP]
[CLS] most nitrate ##s and many sulfate ##s are water - soluble . [SEP]
[CLS] exceptions include bari ##um sulfate , calcium sulfate ( spa ##ring ##ly soluble ) , and lead ( ii ) sulfate , where the 2 + / 2 ##âˆ’ pairing leads to high lattice energies . [SEP]
[CLS] for similar reasons , most al ##kali metal carbonate ##s are not soluble in water . [SEP]
[CLS] some soluble carbonate salts are : sodium carbonate , potassium carbonate and am ##monium carbonate . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , li ##qui ##fied ( molten ) salts and solutions containing dissolved salts ( e . g . , sodium chloride in water ) are called electro ##ly ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] some salts with low lattice energies are liquid at or near room temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] these include molten salts , which are usually mixture ##s of salts , and ionic liquids , which usually contain organic cat ##ions . [SEP]
[CLS] salts are often referred to only by the name of the cat ##ion ( e . g . , " sodium salt " or " am ##monium salt " ) or by the name of the an ##ion ( e . g . , " chloride salt " or " ace ##tate salt " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] strong salts or strong electro ##ly ##te salts are chemical salts composed of strong electro ##ly ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] strong salts are especially useful when creating conduct ##ive compounds as their constituent ions allow for greater conduct ##ivity . [SEP]
