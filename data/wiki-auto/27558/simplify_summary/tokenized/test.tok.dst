[CLS] in chemistry , a salt is a solid chemical compound consisting of an assembly of cat ##ions and an ##ions . [SEP]
[CLS] salts are composed of related numbers of cat ##ions ( positively charged ions ) and an ##ions ( negative ions ) so that the product is electrically neutral ( without a net charge ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these component ions can be inorganic , such as chloride ( cl ) , or organic , such as ace ##tate ( ch ##3 ##co ##2 ##− ) ; and can be mona ##tom ##ic , such as flu ##ori ##de ( f ) , or poly ##ato ##mic , such as sulfate ( so ##42 ##− ) . [SEP]
[CLS] salts can be classified in a variety of ways . [SEP]
[CLS] salts that produce hydro ##xide ions when dissolved in water are called " al ##kali salts " . [SEP]
[CLS] salts that produce acidic solutions are " acid salts " . [SEP]
[CLS] " neutral salts " are those salts that are neither acidic nor basic . [SEP]
[CLS] z ##wi ##tter ##ions contain an an ##ion ##ic and a cat ##ion ##ic centres in the same molecule , but are not considered to be salts . [SEP]
[CLS] examples of z ##wi ##tter ##ions include amino acids , many meta ##bol ##ites , peptide ##s , and proteins . [SEP]
[CLS] solid salts tend to be transparent as illustrated by sodium chloride . [SEP]
[CLS] in many cases , the apparent op ##ac ##ity or transparency are only related to the difference in size of the individual mono ##cr ##yst ##als . [SEP]
[CLS] since light reflects from the grain boundaries ( boundaries between crystal ##lite ##s ) , larger crystals tend to be transparent , while the poly ##cr ##yst ##all ##ine aggregate ##s look like white powder ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] salts exist in many different colors , which arise either from the an ##ions or cat ##ions . [SEP]
[CLS] few minerals are salts because they would be sol ##ub ##ili ##zed by water . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly inorganic pigment ##s tend not to be salts , because ins ##ol ##ub ##ility is required for fast ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] some organic dye ##s are salts , but they are virtually ins ##ol ##ub ##le in water . [SEP]
[CLS] different salts can eli ##cit all five basic tastes , e . g . , salty ( sodium chloride ) , sweet ( lead dia ##ce ##tate , which will cause lead poisoning if ing ##ested ) , sour ( potassium bit ##art ##rate ) , bitter ( magnesium sulfate ) , and um ##ami or sa ##vor ##y ( mono ##so ##dium g ##lu ##tama ##te ) . [SEP]
[CLS] salts of strong acids and strong bases ( " strong salts " ) are non - volatile and often odor ##less , whereas salts of either weak acids or weak bases ( " weak salts " ) may smell like the con ##ju ##gate acid ( e . g . , ace ##tate ##s like ace ##tic acid ( vinegar ) and cy ##ani ##des like hydrogen cy ##ani ##de ( almond ##s ) ) or the con ##ju ##gate base ( e . g . , am ##monium salts like ammonia ) of the component ions . [SEP]
[CLS] that slow , partial decomposition is usually accelerated by the presence of water , since hydro ##lysis is the other half of the rev ##ers ##ible reaction equation of formation of weak salts . [SEP]
[CLS] many ionic compounds exhibit significant sol ##ub ##ility in water or other polar solvent ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike molecular compounds , salts di ##sso ##cia ##te in solution into an ##ion ##ic and cat ##ion ##ic components . [SEP]
[CLS] the lattice energy , the co ##hesive forces between these ions within a solid , determines the sol ##ub ##ility . [SEP]
[CLS] the sol ##ub ##ility is dependent on how well each ion interact ##s with the solvent , so certain patterns become apparent . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , salts of sodium , potassium and am ##monium are usually soluble in water . [SEP]
[CLS] notable exceptions include am ##monium he ##xa ##ch ##lor ##op ##lat ##inate and potassium cobalt ##ini ##tri ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] most nitrate ##s and many sulfate ##s are water - soluble . [SEP]
[CLS] exceptions include bari ##um sulfate , calcium sulfate ( spa ##ring ##ly soluble ) , and lead ( ii ) sulfate , where the 2 + / 2 ##− pairing leads to high lattice energies . [SEP]
[CLS] for similar reasons , most al ##kali metal carbonate ##s are not soluble in water . [SEP]
[CLS] some soluble carbonate salts are : sodium carbonate , potassium carbonate and am ##monium carbonate . [SEP]
[CLS] salts are characteristic ##ally ins ##ulator ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] molten salts or solutions of salts conduct electricity . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , li ##qui ##fied ( molten ) salts and solutions containing dissolved salts ( e . g . , sodium chloride in water ) are called electro ##ly ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] salts characteristic ##ally have high melting points . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , sodium chloride melt ##s at 80 ##1 °c . [SEP]
[CLS] some salts with low lattice energies are liquid at or near room temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] these include molten salts , which are usually mixture ##s of salts , and ionic liquids , which usually contain organic cat ##ions . [SEP]
[CLS] these liquids exhibit unusual properties as solvent ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the name of a salt starts with the name of the cat ##ion ( e . g . , " sodium " or " am ##monium " ) followed by the name of the an ##ion ( e . g . , " chloride " or " ace ##tate " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] salts are often referred to only by the name of the cat ##ion ( e . g . , " sodium salt " or " am ##monium salt " ) or by the name of the an ##ion ( e . g . , " chloride salt " or " ace ##tate salt " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] strong salts or strong electro ##ly ##te salts are chemical salts composed of strong electro ##ly ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] these ionic compounds di ##sso ##cia ##te completely in water . [SEP]
[CLS] they are generally o ##dou ##rle ##ss and non ##vo ##lat ##ile . [SEP]
[CLS] strong salts start with na _ _ , k _ _ , nh _ _ , or they end with _ _ no , _ _ cl ##o , or _ _ ch ##co ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] most group 1 and 2 metals form strong salts . [SEP]
[CLS] strong salts are especially useful when creating conduct ##ive compounds as their constituent ions allow for greater conduct ##ivity . [SEP]
[CLS] weak salts or " weak electro ##ly ##te salts " are , as the name suggests , composed of weak electro ##ly ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] they are generally more volatile than strong salts . [SEP]
[CLS] they may be similar in odor to the acid or base they are derived from . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , sodium ace ##tate , na ##ch ##co ##o , smells similar to ace ##tic acid ch ##co ##oh . [SEP]
