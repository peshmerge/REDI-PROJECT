[CLS] the volta ##ic pile was the first electrical battery that could continuously provide an electric current to a circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] it was invented by italian physicist alessandro volta , who published his experiments in 1799 . [SEP]
[CLS] the volta ##ic pile then enabled a rapid series of other discoveries including the electrical decomposition ( electro ##lysis ) of water into oxygen and hydrogen by william nicholson and anthony carlisle ( 1800 ) and the discovery or isolation of the chemical elements sodium ( 1807 ) , potassium ( 1807 ) , calcium ( 1808 ) , bo ##ron ( 1808 ) , bari ##um ( 1808 ) , st ##ron ##tium ( 1808 ) , and magnesium ( 1808 ) by hum ##ph ##ry davy . [SEP]
[CLS] the entire 19th - century electrical industry was powered by batteries related to volta ' s ( e . g . the daniel ##l cell and grove cell ) until the advent of the dynamo ( the electrical generator ) in the 1870s . [SEP]
[CLS] volta ' s invention was built on luigi gal ##vani ' s 1780 ##s discovery of how a circuit of two metals and a frog ' s leg can cause the frog ' s leg to respond . [SEP]
[CLS] volta demonstrated in 1794 that when two metals and br ##ine - soaked cloth or cardboard are arranged in a circuit they produce an electric current . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1800 , volta stacked several pairs of alternating copper ( or silver ) and zinc discs ( electrode ##s ) separated by cloth or cardboard soaked in br ##ine ( electro ##ly ##te ) to increase the electro ##ly ##te conduct ##ivity . [SEP]
[CLS] when the top and bottom contacts were connected by a wire , an electric current flowed through the volta ##ic pile and the connecting wire . [SEP]
[CLS] on 20 march 1800 , alessandro volta wrote to the london royal society to describe the technique for producing electric current using his device . [SEP]
[CLS] on learning of the volta ##ic pile , william nicholson and anthony carlisle used it to discover the electro ##lysis of water . [SEP]
[CLS] hum ##ph ##ry davy showed that the electro ##mot ##ive force , which drives the electric current through a circuit containing a single volta ##ic cell , was caused by a chemical reaction , not by the voltage difference between the two metals . [SEP]
[CLS] he also used the volta ##ic pile to deco ##mp ##ose chemicals and to produce new chemicals . [SEP]
[CLS] william hyde wo ##llas ##ton showed that electricity from volta ##ic piles had identical effects to those of electricity produced by friction . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1802 va ##sily pet ##rov used volta ##ic piles in the discovery and research of electric arc effects . [SEP]
[CLS] sir hum ##ph ##ry davy and andrew cross ##e were among the first to develop large volta ##ic piles . [SEP]
[CLS] davy used a 2000 - pair pile made for the royal institution in 1808 to demonstrate carbon arc discharge and isolate five new elements : bari ##um , calcium , bo ##ron , st ##ron ##tium and magnesium . [SEP]
[CLS] because volta believed that the electro ##mot ##ive force occurred at the contact between the two metals , volta ' s piles had a different design than the modern design illustrated on this page . [SEP]
[CLS] his piles had one extra disc of copper at the top , in contact with the zinc , and one extra disc of zinc at the bottom , in contact with the copper . [SEP]
[CLS] expanding on volta ' s work and the electro - magnet ##ism work of his mentor hum ##ph ##ry davy , michael far ##aday utilized both magnet ##s and the volta ##ic pile in his experiments with electricity . [SEP]
[CLS] far ##aday believed that all “ electric ##ities ” being studied at the time ( volta ##ic , magnetic , thermal , and animal ) were one and the same . [SEP]
[CLS] his work to prove this theory led him to propose two laws of electro ##chemist ##ry which stood in direct conflict with the current scientific beliefs of the day as laid down by volta thirty years earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] because of their contributions to the understanding of this field of study , far ##aday and volta are both considered to be among the fathers of electro ##chemist ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] the words " electrode " and " electro ##ly ##te " , used above to describe volta ' s work , are due to far ##aday . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of high - voltage " dry piles " were invented between the early 19th century and the 1830s in an attempt to determine the source of electricity of the wet volta ##ic pile , and specifically to support volta ' s hypothesis of contact tension . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , volta himself experimented with a pile whose cardboard discs had dried out , most likely accidentally . [SEP]
[CLS] the first to publish was johann wilhelm ritter in 1802 , albeit in an obscure journal , but over the next decade , it was announced repeatedly as a new discovery . [SEP]
[CLS] one form of dry pile is the za ##mbo ##ni pile . [SEP]
[CLS] francis ronald ##s in 1814 was one of the first to realise that dry piles also worked through chemical reaction rather than metal to metal contact , even though corrosion was not visible due to the very small currents generated . [SEP]
[CLS] the dry pile could be referred to as the ancestor of the modern dry cell . [SEP]
[CLS] the strength of the pile is expressed in terms of its electro ##mot ##ive force , or em ##f , given in vol ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] alessandro volta ' s theory of contact tension considered that the em ##f , which drives the electric current through a circuit containing a volta ##ic cell , occurs at the contact between the two metals . [SEP]
[CLS] volta did not consider the electro ##ly ##te , which was typically br ##ine in his experiments , to be significant . [SEP]
[CLS] however , chemist ##s soon realized that water in the electro ##ly ##te was involved in the pile ' s chemical reactions , and led to the evolution of hydrogen gas from the copper or silver electrode . [SEP]
[CLS] the modern , atomic understanding of a cell with zinc and copper electrode ##s separated by an electro ##ly ##te is the following . [SEP]
[CLS] this reaction is called oxidation . [SEP]
[CLS] this reaction is called reduction . [SEP]
[CLS] the electrons used from the copper to form the molecules of hydrogen are made up by an external wire or circuit that connects it to the zinc . [SEP]
[CLS] the hydrogen molecules formed on the surface of the copper by the reduction reaction ultimately bubble away as hydrogen gas . [SEP]
[CLS] one will observe that the global electro - chemical reaction does not immediately involve the electro ##chemical couple cu / cu ( ox / red ) corresponding to the copper cat ##ho ##de . [SEP]
[CLS] the copper metal disk thus only serves here as a " chemical ##ly in ##ert " noble metallic conductor for the transport of electrons in the circuit and does not chemical ##ly participate to the reaction in the a ##que ##ous phase . [SEP]
[CLS] the copper electrode could be replaced in the system by any sufficiently noble / in ##ert metallic conductor ( ag , pt , stainless steel , graph ##ite , . . . ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in which a vertical bar each time represents an interface . [SEP]
[CLS] the double vertical bar represents the interfaces corresponding to the electro ##ly ##te imp ##re ##gna ##ting the por ##ous cardboard disk . [SEP]
[CLS] when no current is drawn from the pile , each cell , consisting of zinc / electro ##ly ##te / copper , generates 0 . 76 v with a br ##ine electro ##ly ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] the voltage ##s from the cells in the pile add , so the six cells in the diagram above generate 4 . 56 v of electro ##mot ##ive force . [SEP]
