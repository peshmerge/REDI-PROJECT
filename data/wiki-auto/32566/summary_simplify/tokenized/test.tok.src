[CLS] in 1800 , volta stacked several pairs of alternating copper ( or silver ) and zinc discs ( electrode ##s ) separated by cloth or cardboard soaked in br ##ine ( electro ##ly ##te ) to increase the electro ##ly ##te conduct ##ivity . [SEP]
[CLS] when the top and bottom contacts were connected by a wire , an electric current flowed through the volta ##ic pile and the connecting wire . [SEP]
[CLS] on 20 march 1800 , alessandro volta wrote to the london royal society to describe the technique for producing electric current using his device . [SEP]
[CLS] hum ##ph ##ry davy showed that the electro ##mot ##ive force , which drives the electric current through a circuit containing a single volta ##ic cell , was caused by a chemical reaction , not by the voltage difference between the two metals . [SEP]
[CLS] sir hum ##ph ##ry davy and andrew cross ##e were among the first to develop large volta ##ic piles . [SEP]
[CLS] because volta believed that the electro ##mot ##ive force occurred at the contact between the two metals , volta ' s piles had a different design than the modern design illustrated on this page . [SEP]
[CLS] expanding on volta ' s work and the electro - magnet ##ism work of his mentor hum ##ph ##ry davy , michael far ##aday utilized both magnet ##s and the volta ##ic pile in his experiments with electricity . [SEP]
[CLS] far ##aday believed that all “ electric ##ities ” being studied at the time ( volta ##ic , magnetic , thermal , and animal ) were one and the same . [SEP]
[CLS] his work to prove this theory led him to propose two laws of electro ##chemist ##ry which stood in direct conflict with the current scientific beliefs of the day as laid down by volta thirty years earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of high - voltage " dry piles " were invented between the early 19th century and the 1830s in an attempt to determine the source of electricity of the wet volta ##ic pile , and specifically to support volta ' s hypothesis of contact tension . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , volta himself experimented with a pile whose cardboard discs had dried out , most likely accidentally . [SEP]
[CLS] the first to publish was johann wilhelm ritter in 1802 , albeit in an obscure journal , but over the next decade , it was announced repeatedly as a new discovery . [SEP]
[CLS] francis ronald ##s in 1814 was one of the first to realise that dry piles also worked through chemical reaction rather than metal to metal contact , even though corrosion was not visible due to the very small currents generated . [SEP]
[CLS] the dry pile could be referred to as the ancestor of the modern dry cell . [SEP]
[CLS] alessandro volta ' s theory of contact tension considered that the em ##f , which drives the electric current through a circuit containing a volta ##ic cell , occurs at the contact between the two metals . [SEP]
[CLS] volta did not consider the electro ##ly ##te , which was typically br ##ine in his experiments , to be significant . [SEP]
[CLS] however , chemist ##s soon realized that water in the electro ##ly ##te was involved in the pile ' s chemical reactions , and led to the evolution of hydrogen gas from the copper or silver electrode . [SEP]
[CLS] the modern , atomic understanding of a cell with zinc and copper electrode ##s separated by an electro ##ly ##te is the following . [SEP]
[CLS] the electrons used from the copper to form the molecules of hydrogen are made up by an external wire or circuit that connects it to the zinc . [SEP]
[CLS] the hydrogen molecules formed on the surface of the copper by the reduction reaction ultimately bubble away as hydrogen gas . [SEP]
[CLS] the copper metal disk thus only serves here as a " chemical ##ly in ##ert " noble metallic conductor for the transport of electrons in the circuit and does not chemical ##ly participate to the reaction in the a ##que ##ous phase . [SEP]
[CLS] the copper electrode could be replaced in the system by any sufficiently noble / in ##ert metallic conductor ( ag , pt , stainless steel , graph ##ite , . . . ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in which a vertical bar each time represents an interface . [SEP]
[CLS] when no current is drawn from the pile , each cell , consisting of zinc / electro ##ly ##te / copper , generates 0 . 76 v with a br ##ine electro ##ly ##te . [SEP]
