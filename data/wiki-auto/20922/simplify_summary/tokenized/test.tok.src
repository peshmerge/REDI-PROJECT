[CLS] a mo ##lot ##ov cocktail , also known as a petrol bomb , gasoline bomb ( united states ) , bottle bomb , poor man ' s grenade , mo ##lot ##ov ##in ko ##kt ##ail ##i ( finnish ) , pol ##tto ##pu ##llo ( finnish ) , fire bomb ( not to be confused with an actual fire bomb ) , fire bottle or just mo ##lot ##ov , sometimes shortened as molly , is a generic name used for a variety of bottle - based improvised inc ##end ##iary weapons . [SEP]
[CLS] due to the relative ease of production , mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s have been used by street criminals , protesters , riot ##ers , criminal gangs , urban guerrillas , terrorists , hard - line militants , anarchist ##s , anti - communists , communists , irregular soldiers , or even regular soldiers short on equivalent military - issue weapons . [SEP]
[CLS] they are primarily intended to ign ##ite rather than completely destroy targets , and are often used just as much to cause chaos as to actually do damage . [SEP]
[CLS] the name " mo ##lot ##ov cocktail " was coined by the finn ##s during the winter war , called in or " mo ##lot ##ov ##in ko ##kt ##ail ##i " . [SEP]
[CLS] the name was an insulting reference to soviet foreign minister v ##ya ##ches ##lav mo ##lot ##ov , who was one of the architects of the mo ##lot ##ov – rib ##ben ##tro ##p pact signed in late august 1939 . [SEP]
[CLS] the pact with nazi germany was widely mocked by the finn ##s , as was much of the propaganda mo ##lot ##ov produced to accompany the pact , including his declaration on soviet state radio that bombing missions over finland were actually airborne humanitarian food deliveries for their starving neighbours . [SEP]
[CLS] the finn ##s sarcastically dubbed the soviet cluster bombs " mo ##lot ##ov bread baskets " in reference to mo ##lot ##ov ' s propaganda broadcasts . [SEP]
[CLS] when the hand - held bottle fire ##bo ##mb was developed to attack soviet tanks , the finn ##s called it the " mo ##lot ##ov cocktail " , as " a drink to go with the food " . [SEP]
[CLS] a mo ##lot ##ov cocktail is a break ##able glass bottle containing a fl ##am ##mable substance such as petrol , alcohol , or a nap ##al ##m - like mixture , with some motor oil added , and usually a source of ignition such as a burning cloth wi ##ck held in place by the bottle ' s stop ##per . [SEP]
[CLS] the wi ##ck is usually soaked in alcohol or ke ##rose ##ne , rather than petrol . [SEP]
[CLS] in action , the wi ##ck is lit and the bottle hurled at a target such as a vehicle or fortification . [SEP]
[CLS] when the bottle smash ##es on impact , the ensuing cloud of fuel droplets and va ##pour is ignited by the attached wi ##ck , causing an immediate fire ##ball followed by spreading flames as the remainder of the fuel is consumed . [SEP]
[CLS] other fl ##am ##mable liquids such as diesel fuel , met ##han ##ol , tu ##rp ##ent ##ine , jet fuel , and iso ##pro ##py ##l alcohol have been used in place of , or combined with petrol . [SEP]
[CLS] thick ##ening agents such as solvent ##s , foam poly ##sty ##ren ##e , baking soda , petroleum jelly , tar , strips of tyre tub ##ing , ni ##tro ##cel ##lu ##los ##e , xp ##s foam , motor oil , rubber cement , deter ##gent and dish soap have been added to help the burning liquid adhere to the target and create clouds of thick , choking smoke . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , toxic substances are also known to be added to the mixture , in order to create a su ##ff ##ocating or poisonous gas on the resulting explosion , effectively turning the mo ##lot ##ov cocktail into a makeshift chemical weapon . [SEP]
[CLS] these include b ##lea ##ch , ch ##lor ##ine , various strong acids , pest ##icides , among others . [SEP]
[CLS] improvised inc ##end ##iary devices of this type were used for the first time in the spanish civil war between july 1936 and april 1939 , before they became known as " mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1936 , general francisco franco ordered spanish nationalist forces to use the weapon against soviet t - 26 tanks supporting the spanish republicans in a failed assault on the nationalist stronghold of se ##sen ##a , near toledo , 40 km south of madrid . [SEP]
[CLS] after that , both sides used simple petrol bombs or petrol - soaked blankets with some success . [SEP]
[CLS] the battle of k ##hal ##kh ##in go ##l , a border conflict of 1939 ostensibly between mongolia and manchu ##ku ##o , saw heavy fighting between japanese and soviet forces . [SEP]
[CLS] short of anti - tank equipment , japanese infantry attacked soviet tanks with gasoline - filled bottles . [SEP]
[CLS] japanese infantry ##men claimed that several hundred soviet tanks had been destroyed this way , though soviet loss records do not support this assessment . [SEP]
[CLS] on 30 november 1939 , the soviet union attacked finland , starting what came to be known as the winter war . [SEP]
[CLS] the finn ##s perfect ##ed the design and tactical use of the petrol bomb . [SEP]
[CLS] the fuel for the mo ##lot ##ov cocktail was refined to a slightly sticky mixture of gasoline , ke ##rose ##ne , tar , and potassium ch ##lor ##ate . [SEP]
[CLS] further ref ##ine ##ments included the attachment of wind - proof matches or a phi ##al of chemicals that would ign ##ite on break ##age , thereby removing the need to pre - ign ##ite the bottle , and leaving the bottle about one - third empty was found to make breaking more likely . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s were eventually mass - produced by the al ##ko corporation at its raja ##ma ##ki distillery , bundled with matches to light them . [SEP]
[CLS] production total ##led 450 , 000 during the winter war . [SEP]
[CLS] the original recipe of the mo ##lot ##ov cocktail was a mixture of ethanol , tar and gasoline in a 750 ml bottle . [SEP]
[CLS] the bottle had two long p ##yr ##ote ##ch ##nic storm matches attached to either side . [SEP]
[CLS] before use , one or both of the matches was lit ; when the bottle broke on impact , the mixture ignited . [SEP]
[CLS] the storm matches were found to be safer to use than a burning rag on the mouth of the bottle . [SEP]
[CLS] early in 1940 , with the prospect of immediate invasion , the possibilities of the petrol bomb gripped the imagination of the british public . [SEP]
[CLS] for the lay ##man , the petrol bomb had the benefit of using entirely familiar and available materials , and they were quickly improvised in large numbers , with the intention of using them against enemy tanks . [SEP]
[CLS] the finn ##s had found that they were effective when used in the right way and in sufficient numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] although the experience of the spanish civil war received more publicity , the more sophisticated petroleum warfare tactics of the finn ##s were not lost on british commanders . [SEP]
[CLS] win ##tri ##ng ##ham advised that a tank that was isolated from supporting infantry was potentially vulnerable to men who had the required determination and cunning to get close . [SEP]
[CLS] rifles or even a shotgun would be sufficient to persuade the crew to close all the hatch ##es , and then the view from the tank is very limited ; a turret - mounted machine gun has a very slow traverse and cannot hope to fen ##d off attackers coming from all directions . [SEP]
[CLS] once sufficiently close , it is possible to hide where the tank ' s gunner cannot see : " the most dangerous distance away from a tank is 200 yards ; the safe ##st distance is six inches . " [SEP]
[CLS] petrol bombs will soon produce a pal ##l of blinding smoke , and a well - placed explosive package or even a stout iron bar in the tracks can im ##mo ##bilis ##e the vehicle , leaving it at the mercy of further petrol bombs – which will su ##ff ##oca ##te the engine and possibly the crew – or an explosive charge or anti - tank mine . [SEP]
[CLS] by august 1940 , the war office produced training instructions for the creation and use of mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the instructions suggested scoring the bottles vertically with a diamond to ensure break ##age and providing fuel - soaked rag , wind ##proof matches or a length of cinema film ( made of highly fl ##am ##mable ni ##tro ##cel ##lu ##los ##e ) as a source of ignition . [SEP]
[CLS] on 29 july 1940 , manufacturers al ##bright & wilson of old ##bury demonstrated to the raf how their white phosphorus could be used to ign ##ite inc ##end ##iary bombs . [SEP]
[CLS] the demonstration involved throwing glass bottles containing a mixture of petrol and phosphorus at pieces of wood and into a hut . [SEP]
[CLS] on breaking , the phosphorus was exposed to the air and spontaneously ignited ; the petrol also burned , resulting in a fierce fire . [SEP]
[CLS] because of safety concerns , the raf was not interested in white phosphorus as a source of ignition , but the idea of a self - ign ##iting petrol bomb took hold . [SEP]
[CLS] initially known as an a . w . bomb , it was officially named the no . 76 grenade , but more commonly known as the sip ( self - ign ##iting phosphorus ) grenade . [SEP]
[CLS] the perfect ##ed list of ingredients was white phosphorus , benz ##ene , water and a two - inch strip of raw rubber ; all in a half - pin ##t bottle sealed with a crown stop ##per . [SEP]
[CLS] over time , the rubber would slowly dissolve , making the contents slightly sticky , and the mixture would separate into two layers – this was intentional , and the grenade should not be shaken to mix the layers , as this would only delay ignition . [SEP]
[CLS] when thrown against a hard surface , the glass would shatter and the contents would instantly ign ##ite , li ##ber ##ating choking fu ##mes of phosphorus pen ##to ##xide and sulfur dioxide as well as producing a great deal of heat . [SEP]
[CLS] strict instructions were issued to store the grenades safely , prefer ##ably underwater and certainly never in a house . [SEP]
[CLS] mainly issued to the home guard as an anti - tank weapon , it was produced in vast numbers ; by august 1941 well over 6 , 000 , 000 had been manufactured . [SEP]
[CLS] there were many who were sc ##ept ##ical about the efficacy of mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s and sip ##s grenades against the more modern german tanks . [SEP]
[CLS] weapon designer stuart mac ##rae witnessed a trial of the sip ##s grenade at far ##nb ##orough : " there was some concern that , if the tank drivers could not pull up quickly enough and hop out , they were likely to be fr ##iz ##zle ##d to death , but after looking at the bottles they said they would be happy to take a chance . " [SEP]
[CLS] the drivers were proved right , trials on modern british tanks confirmed that mo ##lot ##ov and sip grenades caused the occupants of the tanks " no inc ##on ##ven ##ience whatsoever . " [SEP]
[CLS] win ##tri ##ng ##ham , though enthusiastic about improvised weapons , caution ##ed against a reliance on petrol bombs and repeatedly emphasis ##ed the importance of using explosive charges . [SEP]
[CLS] during the irish war of independence , the irish republican army sometimes used so ##ds of turf soaked in para ##ffin oil to attack british army barracks . [SEP]
[CLS] fencing wire was pushed through the so ##d to make a throwing handle . [SEP]
[CLS] the polish home army developed a version which ignited on impact without the need of a wi ##ck . [SEP]
[CLS] ignition was caused by a reaction between concentrated sulfur ##ic acid mixed with the fuel and a mixture of potassium ch ##lor ##ate and sugar which was crystal ##lized from solution onto a rag attached to the bottle . [SEP]
[CLS] the united states marine corps developed a version during world war ii that used a tube of ni ##tric acid and a lump of metallic sodium to ign ##ite a mixture of petrol and diesel fuel . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s were reportedly used in the united states for arson attacks on shops and other buildings during the 1992 los angeles riots . [SEP]
[CLS] during the second battle of fall ##uj ##ah in 2004 , u . s . marines employed mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s made with " one part liquid laundry deter ##gent , two parts gas " while clearing houses " when contact is made in a house and the enemy must be burned out " . [SEP]
[CLS] the tactic " was developed in response to the enemy ' s tactics " of guerrilla warfare and particularly martyr ##dom tactics which often resulted in u . s . marine casualties . [SEP]
[CLS] the cocktail was a less ex ##ped ##ient alternative to white phosphorus mortar rounds or prop ##ane tanks detonated with c ##4 ( nicknamed the " house guest " ) - all of which proved effective at burning out engaged enemy combatants . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s were also used by protesters and civilian militia in ukraine during violent outbreak ##s of the euro ##maid ##an and the 2014 ukrainian revolution . [SEP]
[CLS] protesters during the ferguson riots used mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in bangladesh during anti government protests at the time of the 2014 national election , many buses and cars were targeted with petrol bombs . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of people burnt to death and many more were injured during the period 2013 - 2014 due to petrol bomb attacks . [SEP]
[CLS] during the protests in venezuela from 2014 and into 2017 , protesters had used mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s similar demonstrators in other countries . [SEP]
[CLS] as the 2017 venezuelan protests intensified , demonstrators began using " pup ##uto ##vs " , a play on words of mo ##lot ##ov , with glass devices filled with ex ##cre ##ment being thrown at authorities after the ps ##u ##v ruling - party official , jacqueline far ##ia , mocked protesters who had to crawl through sewage in caracas ' gu ##aire river to avoid tear gas . [SEP]
[CLS] on 8 may , the hash ##tag # pup ##uto ##v became the top trend on twitter in venezuela as reports of authorities vomiting after being drenched in ex ##cre ##ment began to ci ##rc ##ulate . [SEP]
[CLS] by 10 may 2017 , venezuelan ##s unrelated to political parties called for a " march ##a de la mi ##er ##da " , or a " " march of shit " " , essentially establishing pup ##uto ##vs in the arsenal of venezuelan protesters . [SEP]
[CLS] a month later on 4 june 2017 during protests against donald trump in portland , oregon , protesters began throwing balloons filled with " unknown , foul - smelling liquid " at officers . [SEP]
[CLS] as inc ##end ##iary devices , mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s are illegal to manufacture or possess in many regions . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s are considered " destructive devices " under the national firearms act and regulated by the at ##f . [SEP]
[CLS] wil casey floyd , formerly from elk ##hart lake , wisconsin , after throwing mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s to seattle police officers may 1 , 2016 during a protest , was arrested in april 2017 ; he pleaded guilty for using the inc ##end ##iary devices on february 2018 . [SEP]
[CLS] at simpson county , kentucky , 20 - year - old trey alexander g ##wat ##hn ##ey - law attempted to burn franklin - simpson county middle school with five mo ##lot ##ov cocktail ##s ; he has been found guilty of making and possessing illegal firearms and was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2018 .
