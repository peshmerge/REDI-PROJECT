[CLS] the pandora myth is a kind of theo ##dic ##y , addressing the question of why there is evil in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] according to this , pandora opened a jar ( " pit ##hos " ) , in modern accounts sometimes mist ##ran ##sl ##ated as " pandora ' s box " , releasing all the evil ##s of humanity . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##sio ##d ' s interpretation of pandora ' s story , sometimes considered as mis ##ogy ##nous , went on to influence both jewish and christian theology and so per ##pet ##uated her bad reputation into the renaissance . [SEP]
[CLS] later poets , drama ##tist ##s , painters and sculptors made her their subject and over the course of five centuries contributed new insights into her motives and significance . [SEP]
[CLS] the pandora myth first appears in lines 560 – 61 ##2 of he ##sio ##d ' s poem in epic meter , the " theo ##gon ##y " ( c . 8th – 7th centuries bc ) , without ever giving the woman a name . [SEP]
[CLS] after humans received the stolen gift of fire from prom ##eth ##eus , an angry zeus decides to give humanity a punish ##ing gift to compensate for the boon they had been given . [SEP]
[CLS] he commands he ##pha ##est ##us to mold from earth the first woman , a " beautiful evil " whose descendants would torment the human race . [SEP]
[CLS] after he ##pha ##est ##us does so , athena dresses her in a silvery gown , an embroidered veil , garland ##s and an ornate crown of silver . [SEP]
[CLS] when she first appears before gods and mortals , " wonder seized them " as they looked upon her . [SEP]
[CLS] from her is the race of women and female kind : of her is the deadly race and tribe of women who live amongst mortal men to their great trouble , no help ##mates in hate ##ful poverty , but only in wealth . [SEP]
[CLS] in this version of the myth ( lines 60 – 105 ) , he ##sio ##d expands upon her origin , and moreover widen ##s the scope of the misery she in ##flict ##s on humanity . [SEP]
[CLS] as before , she is created by he ##pha ##est ##us , but now more gods contribute to her completion ( 63 – 82 ) : athena taught her needle ##work and weaving ( 63 – 4 ) ; ap ##hr ##od ##ite " shed grace upon her head and cruel longing and cares that weary the limbs " ( 65 – 6 ) ; hermes gave her " a shame ##ful mind and dec ##eit ##ful nature " ( 67 – 8 ) ; hermes also gave her the power of speech , putting in her " lies and craft ##y words " ( 77 – 80 ) ; athena then clothed her ( 72 ) ; next persuasion and the char ##ites adorned her with necklace ##s and other finer ##y ( 72 – 4 ) ; the ho ##rae adorned her with a garland crown ( 75 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in this re ##tell ##ing of her story , pandora ' s dec ##eit ##ful feminine nature becomes the least of humanity ' s worries . [SEP]
[CLS] for she brings with her a jar ( which , due to textual corruption in the sixteenth century , came to be called a box ) containing " burden ##some to ##il and sickness that brings death to men " ( 91 – 2 ) , diseases ( 102 ) and " a myriad other pains " ( 100 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] but ep ##ime ##the ##us did not listen ; he accepted pandora , who promptly scattered the contents of her jar . [SEP]
[CLS] one item , however , did not escape the jar ( 96 – 9 ) : only hope was left within her un ##break ##able house , she remained under the lip of the jar , and did not fly away . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##sio ##d also outlines how the end of man ' s golden age ( an all - male society of immortals who were rev ##ere ##nt to the gods , worked hard , and ate from abundant groves of fruit ) was brought on by prom ##eth ##eus . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , pandora was created and given the jar ( mist ##ran ##sl ##ated as ' box ' ) which releases all evil ##s upon man . [SEP]
[CLS] the mist ##ran ##sl ##ation of " pit ##hos " , a large storage jar , as " box " is usually attributed to the sixteenth century humanist erasmus of rotterdam when he translated he ##sio ##d ' s tale of pandora into latin . [SEP]
[CLS] m . l . west writes that the story of pandora and her jar is from a pre - he ##sio ##dic myth , and that this explains the confusion and problems with he ##sio ##d ' s version and its inc ##on ##clusive ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] he writes that in earlier myths , pandora was married to prom ##eth ##eus , and cites the ancient he ##sio ##dic " catalogue of women " as preserving this older tradition , and that the jar may have at one point contained only good things for humanity . [SEP]
[CLS] he also writes that it may have been that ep ##ime ##the ##us and pandora and their roles were trans ##posed in the pre - he ##sio ##dic myths , a " myth ##ic inversion " . [SEP]
[CLS] he remarks that there is a curious correlation between pandora being made out of earth in he ##sio ##d ' s story , to what is in the " bi ##bl ##iot ##he ##ca " that prom ##eth ##eus created man from water and earth . [SEP]
[CLS] certain vase paintings dated to the 5th century bc likewise indicate that the pre - he ##sio ##dic myth of the goddess pandora endured for centuries after the time of he ##sio ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] in view of such evidence , william e . phi ##pps has pointed out , " classics scholars suggest that he ##sio ##d reversed the meaning of the name of an earth goddess called pandora ( all - giving ) or an ##es ##ido ##ra ( one - who - sends - up - gifts ) . [SEP]
[CLS] vase paintings and literary texts give evidence of pandora as a mother earth figure who was worshipped by some greeks . [SEP]
[CLS] jane ellen harrison also turned to the repertory of vase - painters to shed light on aspects of myth that were left una ##dd ##ressed or disguised in literature . [SEP]
[CLS] she is no longer earth - born , but the creature , the hand ##i ##work of olympian zeus . " [SEP]
[CLS] robert graves , quoting harrison , asserts of the he ##sio ##dic episode that " pandora is not a genuine myth , but an anti - feminist fable , probably of his own invention . " [SEP]
[CLS] rose wrote that the myth of pandora is decidedly more ill ##ibe ##ral than that of epic in that it makes pandora the origin of all of man ' s wo ##es with her being the ex ##em ##pl ##ification of the bad wife . [SEP]
[CLS] a sc ##hol ##ium to line 97 ##1 of ari ##sto ##pha ##nes ' " the birds " mentions a cult " to pandora , the earth , because she best ##ows all things necessary for life " . [SEP]
[CLS] and in fifth - century athens , pandora made a prominent appearance in what , at first , appears an unexpected context , in a marble relief or bronze app ##li ##ques as a fr ##ie ##ze along the base of the " athena part ##hen ##os " , the culminating experience on the ac ##ropolis . [SEP]
[CLS] both were mother ##less , and reinforced via opposite means the civic id ##eo ##logies of patriarch ##y and the " highly gender ##ed social and political realities of fifth - century athens " — athena by rising above her sex to defend it , and pandora by em ##body ##ing the need for it . [SEP]
[CLS] images of pandora began to appear on greek pottery as early as the 5th century bce , although identification of the scene represented is sometimes ambiguous . [SEP]
[CLS] an independent tradition that does not square with any of the classical literary sources is in the visual repertory of attic red - figure vase - painters , which sometimes supplements , sometimes ignores , the written testimony ; in these representations the upper part of pandora is visible rising from the earth , " a ch ##th ##onic goddess like ga ##ia herself . " [SEP]
[CLS] in some cases the figure of pandora emerging from the earth is surrounded by figures carrying hammer ##s in what has been suggested as a scene from a sat ##yr play by so ##ph ##oc ##les , " pandora , or the hammer ##ers " , of which only fragments remain . [SEP]
[CLS] in a late pre - raphael ##ite painting by john d . bat ##ten , hammer - wielding work ##men appear through a doorway , while in the fore ##ground he ##pha ##est ##us brood ##s on the as yet una ##ni ##mate ##d figure of “ pandora ” . [SEP]
[CLS] there were also earlier english paintings of the newly created pandora as surrounded by the heavenly gods presenting gifts , a scene also depicted on ancient greek pottery . [SEP]
[CLS] in one case it was part of a decorative scheme painted on the ceiling at pet ##worth house by louis la ##gue ##rre in about 1720 . [SEP]
[CLS] william et ##ty ’ s " pandora crowned by the seasons " of a century later is similarly presented as an ap ##oth ##eo ##sis taking place among the clouds . [SEP]
[CLS] in between these two had come james barry ’ s huge " birth of pandora " , on which he labour ##ed for over a decade at the turn of the nineteenth century . [SEP]
[CLS] well before that he was working on the design , which was intended to reflect his theoretical writings on the inter ##de ##pen ##den ##ce between history painting and the way it should reflect the ideal state . [SEP]
[CLS] an early drawing , only preserved now in the print made of it by luigi sc ##hia ##von ##etti , follows the account of he ##sio ##d and shows pandora being adorned by the grace ##s and the hours while the gods look on . [SEP]
[CLS] its ideological purpose , however , was to demonstrate an equal society unified by the harmon ##ious function of those within it . [SEP]
[CLS] but in the actual painting which followed much later , a subordinate ##d pandora is surrounded by gift - bearing gods and minerva stands near her , demonstrating the feminine arts proper to her passive role . [SEP]
[CLS] in the individual representations of pandora that were to follow , her ideal ##isation is as a dangerous type of beauty , generally naked or semi - naked . [SEP]
[CLS] she is only differentiated from other paintings or statues of such females by being given the attribute of a jar or , increasingly in the 19th - century , a straight - sided box . [SEP]
[CLS] there is an additional reason why pandora should appear nude , in that it was a theological commonplace going back to the early church fathers that the classical myth of pandora made her a type of eve . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been argued that it was as a result of the hell ##eni ##sation of western asia that the mis ##ogy ##ny in he ##sio ##d ' s account of pandora began openly to influence both jewish and then christian interpretations of scripture . [SEP]
[CLS] the equation of the two also occurs in the 1550 all ##egorical painting by jean cousin the elder , " eva prima pandora " ( eve the first pandora ) , in which a naked woman rec ##lines in a gr ##otto . [SEP]
[CLS] her left arm is wreath ##ed by a snake ( another reference to the temptation of eve ) and that hand rests on an un ##sto ##pped jar , pandora ' s attribute . [SEP]
[CLS] above hangs the sign from which the painting gains its name and beneath it is a closed jar , perhaps the counterpart of the other in olympus , containing blessings . [SEP]
[CLS] accompanying an illustration of her opening the lid of an ur ##n from which demons and angels emerge is a commentary that condemn ##s “ female curiosity and the desire to learn by which the very first woman was dec ##ei ##ved ” . [SEP]
[CLS] in the succeeding century that desire to learn was e ##qua ##ted with the female demand to share the male pre ##ro ##gative of education . [SEP]
[CLS] in nicolas reg ##nier ’ s painting “ the all ##ego ##ry of vanity ” ( 1626 ) , sub ##titled “ pandora ” , it is ty ##pi ##fied by her curiosity about the contents of the ur ##n that she has just un ##sto ##pped and is compared to the other attributes of vanity surrounding her ( fine clothes , jewellery , a pot of gold coins ) . [SEP]
[CLS] again , pietro pa ##olin ##i ’ s lively pandora of about 1632 seems more aware of the effect that her pearls and fashionable head ##ge ##ar is making than of the evil ##s escaping from the jar she holds . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a social message carried by these paintings too , for education , no less than expensive ad ##orn ##ment , is only available to those who can afford it . [SEP]
[CLS] this comes out in portrayal ##s of pandora as a young girl , as in walter crane ’ s “ little pandora ” spilling buttons while en ##cum ##bered by the doll she is carrying , in arthur rack ##ham ’ s book illustration and frederick stuart church ’ s etc ##hing of an adolescent girl taken aback by the contents of the ornamental box she has opened . [SEP]
[CLS] the same innocence informs odi ##lon red ##on ’ s 1910 / 12 clothed figure carrying a box and merging into a landscape su ##ff ##used with light , and even more the 1914 version of a naked pandora surrounded by flowers , a prima ##eva ##l eve in the garden of eden . [SEP]
[CLS] such innocence , “ naked and without alarm ” in the words of an earlier french poet , portrays pandora more as victim of a conflict outside her comprehension than as te ##mpt ##ress . [SEP]
[CLS] " la est ##at ##ua de prom ##ete ##o " ( 1670 ) by pedro calderon de la bar ##ca is made an all ##ego ##ry in which devotion to learning is contrasted with the active life . [SEP]
[CLS] this initiate ##s a debate among the gods whether a creation outside their own work is justified ; his devotion is in the end rewarded with permission to marry his statue . [SEP]
[CLS] in this work , pandora , the statue in question , plays only a passive role in the competition between prom ##eth ##eus and his brother ep ##ime ##the ##us ( sign ##ifying the active life ) , and between the gods and men . [SEP]
[CLS] another point to note about calderon ’ s musical drama is that the theme of a statue married by her creator is more suggest ##ive of the story of p ##y ##gm ##ali ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] there too the creator of a statue an ##imate ##s it with stolen fire , but then the plot is complicated when jupiter also falls in love with this new creation but is prevented by destiny from con ##sum ##mat ##ing it . [SEP]
[CLS] in revenge the god sends destiny to te ##mpt this new eve into opening a box full of curses as a punishment for earth ’ s revolt against heaven . [SEP]
[CLS] if pandora appears suspended between the roles of eve and of p ##y ##gm ##ali ##on ’ s creation in volta ##ire ’ s work , in charles - pierre cola ##rde ##au ’ s erotic poem " les homme ##s de prom ##eth ##ee " ( 1774 ) she is presented equally as a love - object and in addition as an un ##fall ##en eve : having been fashioned from clay and given the quality of “ naive grace combined with feeling ” , she is set to wander through an enchanted landscape . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end the couple quit their marriage couch and survey their surroundings “ as sovereign ##s of the world , kings of the universe ” . [SEP]
[CLS] one other musical work with much the same theme was au ##mal ##e de co ##rse ##n ##ville ' s one - act verse mel ##od ##rama " pan ##dor ##e " , which had an overture and incident ##al music by franz ign ##az beck . [SEP]
[CLS] however , his patron minerva descends to announce that the gods have gifted pandora with other qualities and that she will become the future model and mother of humanity . [SEP]
[CLS] the work was performed on 2 july 1789 , on the very eve of the french revolution , and was soon forgotten in the course of the events that followed . [SEP]
[CLS] though it bears the title " pandora " , what exists of the play revolves round ep ##ime ##the ##us ’ longing for the return of the wife who has abandoned him and has yet to arrive . [SEP]
[CLS] then in the latter ’ s house an “ oak ##en chest , car ##ven with figures and em ##bos ##sed with gold ” attracts her curiosity . [SEP]
[CLS] after she eventually gives in to temptation and opens it , she collapses in despair and a storm destroys the garden outside . [SEP]
[CLS] she is pictured as sprawled over a carved wooden chest on which are em ##bos ##sed golden designs of the three fates who figure as a chorus in long ##fell ##ow ' s scene 3 . [SEP]
[CLS] but on the front of the chest , a medallion showing the serpent wound about the tree of knowledge recalls the old interpretation of pandora as a type of eve . [SEP]
[CLS] in england the high drama of the incident was tr ##aves ##tie ##d in james robinson plan ##che ’ s " olympic rev ##els or prom ##eth ##eus and pandora " ( 1831 ) , the first of the victorian bu ##rle ##sque ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a costume drama pepper ##ed with comic ban ##ter and songs during which the gods bet ##rot ##h pandora to a disappointed prom ##eth ##eus with “ only one little box ” for dowry . [SEP]
[CLS] when she opens it , jupiter descends to curse her and prom ##eth ##eus , but hope emerges from the box and negotiate ##s their pardon . [SEP]
[CLS] it was based in part on the " prom ##eth ##eus bound " of ae ##sch ##ylus but was re ##written so as to give the character of pan ##dor ##e an equal part with his . [SEP]
[CLS] this necessitated her falling “ as if dead ” on hearing the judgement against prom ##eth ##ee in act 1 ; a funeral procession bearing her body at the start of act 2 , after which she revive ##s to mo ##urn the carrying out of prom ##eth ##ee ' s sentence ; while in act 3 she di ##so ##bey ##s prom ##eth ##ee by accepting a box , supposedly filled with blessings for mankind , and makes the tragedy complete . [SEP]
[CLS] the pattern during the 19th century had only repeated that of the nearly three millennia before it . [SEP]
[CLS] it was used as a vehicle to illustrate the prevailing id ##eo ##logies or artistic fashion ##s of the time and eventually became so worn a coinage that it grew confused with other , sometimes later , stories . [SEP]
[CLS] best known in the end for a single metaphor ##ical attribute , the box with which she was not even endowed until the 16th century , depictions of pandora have been further confused with other holders of rec ##ept ##acle ##s – with one of the trials of psyche , with so ##phon ##is ##ba about to drink poison or artemis ##ia with the ashes of her husband . [SEP]
