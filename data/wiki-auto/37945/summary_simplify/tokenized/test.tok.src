[CLS] pa ##isi ##ello was born in tara ##nto in the ap ##ulia region and educated by the jesuits there . [SEP]
[CLS] he became known for his beautiful singing voice and in 1754 was sent to the con ##ser ##vat ##orio di s . ono ##fr ##io at naples , where he studied under francesco duran ##te , and eventually became assistant master . [SEP]
[CLS] for the theatre of the con ##ser ##vat ##orio , which he left in 1763 , he wrote some inter ##me ##zzi , one of which attracted so much notice that he was invited to write two operas , " la pupil ##la " and " il mon ##do al ro ##ves ##cio " , for bologna , and a third , " il marches ##e di ti ##di ##pan ##o " , for rome . [SEP]
[CLS] his reputation now firmly established , he settled for some years at naples , where , despite the popularity of niccolo pic ##cin ##ni , domenico ci ##mar ##osa and pietro gu ##gli ##el ##mi , of whose triumph ##s he was bitterly jealous , he produced a series of highly successful operas , one of which , " l ' ld ##olo ci ##nese " , made a deep impression upon the ne ##ap ##oli ##tan public . [SEP]
[CLS] in the same year he married cecilia pal ##lini , and the marriage was a happy one . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1776 pa ##isi ##ello was invited by the empress catherine ii of russia to st . petersburg , where he remained for eight years , producing , among other charming works , his masterpiece , " il barbie ##re di si ##vi ##glia " , which soon attained a european reputation . [SEP]
[CLS] the fate of this opera marks an epoch in the history of italian art ; for with it the gentle su ##avi ##ty cultivated by the masters of the 18th century died out to make room for the dazzling brilliance of a later period . [SEP]
[CLS] when , in 1816 , gi ##oa ##chin ##o rossi ##ni set a revised version of the libretto to music , under the title of " alma ##vi ##va os ##sia la in ##uti ##l pre ##ca ##uz ##ion ##e " the fans of pa ##isi ##ello stormed the stage . [SEP]
[CLS] rossi ##ni ' s opera , now known as " il barbie ##re di si ##vi ##glia " , is now acknowledged as rossi ##ni ' s greatest work , while pa ##isi ##ello ' s opera is only in ##fr ##e ##quent ##ly produced â€” a strange instance of poetic ##al vengeance , since pa ##isi ##ello himself had many years previously endeavour ##ed to eclipse the fame of giovanni battista per ##gol ##es ##i by reset ##ting the libretto of his famous inter ##me ##zzo , " la ser ##va pad ##rona " . [SEP]
[CLS] pa ##isi ##ello left russia in 1784 , and , after producing " il re te ##od ##oro " at vienna , entered the service of ferdinand iv of naples , where he composed many of his best operas , including " nina " and " la molina ##ra " . [SEP]
[CLS] after many vic ##iss ##itude ##s , resulting from political and d ##yna ##stic changes , he was invited to paris ( 1802 ) by napoleon , whose favor he had won five years previously by composing a march for the funeral of general hoc ##he . [SEP]
[CLS] napoleon treated him mu ##ni ##fi ##cent ##ly , while cruel ##ly neglect ##ing two more famous composers , luigi cher ##ub ##ini and etienne me ##hul , to whom the new favorite transferred the hatred he had formerly borne to ci ##mar ##osa , gu ##gli ##el ##mi and pic ##cin ##ni . [SEP]
[CLS] pa ##isi ##ello conducted the music of the court in the tu ##ile ##ries with a st ##ipe ##nd of 10 , 000 francs and 4 , 800 for lodging , but he entirely failed to con ##ci ##lia ##te the parisian public , who received his opera " prose ##rp ##ine " so coldly that , in 1803 , he requested and with some difficulty obtained permission to return to italy , upon the plea of his wife ' s ill health . [SEP]
[CLS] on his arrival at naples pa ##isi ##ello was reinstated in his former appointments by joseph bonaparte and joachim mu ##rat , but he had tax ##ed his genius beyond its strength , and was unable to meet the demands now made upon it for new ideas . [SEP]
[CLS] pa ##isi ##ello is known to have composed 94 operas , which are known for their gracefully beautiful melodies . [SEP]
[CLS] perhaps the best - known tune he ever wrote is ne ##l co ##r pi ##u non mi sent ##o from " la molina ##ra " , immortal ##ized when beethoven composed variations based on it . [SEP]
[CLS] the library of the ge ##rol ##ami ##ni at naples possesses an interesting manuscript compilation recording pa ##isi ##ello ' s opinions on contemporary composers , and exhibiting him as a somewhat severe critic , especially of the work of per ##gol ##es ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] most of his over 80 operas are comic and use a simple , direct and spirited style , latter ##ly with sharpe ##r characterization , more colorful scoring and warmer melodies ( features that influenced mozart ) . [SEP]
[CLS] his serious operas have less than the conventional amount of vi ##rt ##uo ##so vocal writing ; those for russia are the closest to g ##lu ##ck ' s reform ' approach . " [SEP]
[CLS] his instrumental works are therefore im ##bu ##ed with a similar vocal ##ly conceived melodic line , granted they may be lacking in the sophisticated counter ##point and mo ##tiv ##ic work of haydn and mozart ' s music . [SEP]
