very little is known about this emperor .
kaika 's reign allegedly began in 158 bc , and had one wife and three consorts .
after his death in 98 bc , one of his sons supposedly became the next emperor .
in the " kojiki " and " nihon shoki " , only kaika 's name and genealogy were recorded .
the imperial " misasagi " or tomb for kaika is currently maintained .
kaika was the second son of emperor kogen .
before he was enthroned in 158 bc , his pre-ascension name was " prince nikohiko o-hibi no mikoto " .
his son / heir to the throne was named " sujin " by later generations .
the name " kaika "-tenno " was given to him posthumously by later generations .
like emperor kosho and emperor korei , there is a possibility that " kaika " could have lived instead in the 1st century adamen .
the first emperor that historians state might have actually existed is emperor sujin , the 10th emperor of japan .
outside of the kojiki , the reign of emperor kimmei aarhus 509 – 571 adhesion is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates .
