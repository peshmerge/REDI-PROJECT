Kaika is known as a "legendary emperor" among historians as his actual existence is disputed.
Kaika's reign allegedly began in 158 BC, he had one wife and three consorts of which he fathered five children with.
After his death in 98 BC, one of his sons supposedly became the next emperor.
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and an Imperial "misasagi" or tomb for Kaika is currently maintained; however, no extant contemporary records have been discovered that confirm a view that this historical figure actually reigned.
Before he was enthroned sometime in 158 BC, his pre-ascension name was "Prince Nikohiko Ō-hibi no Mikoto".
Kaika ruled until his death in 98 BC; his second son was then enthroned as the next emperor.
His son/heir to the throne was posthumously named "Sujin" by later generations, and is the first emperor that historians say might have actually existed.
Kaika is thus regarded by historians as a "legendary Emperor", and is considered to have been the eighth of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them.
The name Kaika"-tennō" was assigned to him posthumously by later generations.
Like Emperor Kōshō and Emperor Kōrei, there is a possibility that ""Kaika"" could have lived instead in the 1st century (AD).
Historian Louis Frédéric notes this idea in his book "Japan Encyclopedia" where he says "more likely early AD", but this remains disputed among other researchers.
Outside of the Kojiki, the reign of Emperor Kinmei ( 509 – 571 AD) is the first for which contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates.
The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as "traditional" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.
