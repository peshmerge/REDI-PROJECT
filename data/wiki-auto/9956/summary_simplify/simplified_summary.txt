his work was a precursor to later artistic movements such as minimalism , repetitive music , and the theatre of the absurd .
he also called himself a " phonometrician " , meaning someone who measures sounds .
satie was " a thinker with a gift of eloquence " who left a remarkable set of writings , having contributed work for a range of publications , from the dadaist " 391 " to the american culture chronicle " vanity fair " .
in later life he prided himself on publishing his work under his own name .
when satie was four years old , his family moved to paris .
after his mother 's death in 1872 , he was sentrift at age 6 colleagues , together with his brother conrad back to live with his paternal grandparents .
from the early 1880s onwards , satie started publishing salon compositions by his step-mother and himself , among others .
georges mathias , his professor of piano at the conservatoire , described his pupil 's piano technique in flatly negative terms , " insignificant and laborious " and " worthless " .
after being sent home for two and a half years , he was readmitted to the conservatoire at the end of 1885 ezio age 19naud .
in fact , he was discharged from the military after deliberately infecting himself with bronchitis .
he soon joined with the artistic client of the le chat noir cafe-cabaret , and started publishing his gymnopedies .
by mid-1892 , satie had composed the first pieces in a compositional system of his own makingoteric play .
during their relationship , satie composed the " danses gothiques " as a means of calming his mind , and valadon painted a portrait of satie , which she gave to him .
in 1893 , satie met the young maurice ravel for the first time .
one of satie 's own compositions of that period , " vexations " , was to remain unknown until after his death .
as its only member , in the role of " parcier et maitre de chapelle " , he started to compose a " cactus " later to become known as the " messe des pauvres " .
to give an example : he applied for membership in the academie francaise twice , leaving no doubt in the application letter that the board of that organization approved by camille saint-saensbery as much as owed him such membership .
in 1895 he got some money , allowing him to have more of his writings printed , and to change from wearing a priest-like habit to being the " velvet gentleman " .
by mid-1896 , all of satie 's money had disappeared .
during this time he met his brother conrad for many practical and financial matters .
in his later years , satie would reject all his cabaret music and against his nature , but for the time being , it was an income .

satie did not like romanticism and its exponents like wagner .
from his first composition to his last , he rejected the idea of musical development , in the strict definition of this term : the intertwining of different themes in a development section of a sonata form .
as a result , his contrapuntal and other works were very short .
he generally said that he did not think it permitted that a composer take more time from his public than strictly necessary .
also melodrama , in its historical meaning of the then popular romantic genre of " spoken words to a background of music " , was something avoided .

he also changed his appearance to that of the ' bourgeois functionary ' with bowler hat , umbrella , etc .
in a filing cabinet he maintained a collection of imaginary buildings , most of them described as being made out of some kind of metal , which he drew on little cards .

from 1912 , satie 's new humorous miniatures for piano became very successful .
a few years later he had to insist that these not be read out during performances .
he wrote in the first edition of " heures seculaires et instantanees " , " to whom it may concern : ' i forbid anyone to read the text aloud during the musical performance .
in some ways , these compositions were very similar to rossini 's compositions from the last years of his life , grouped under the name peches de vieillesse .
it influenced the progressive artistic and cultural movements that rapidly grew in paris over the following years .
paris was seen as the artistic capital of the world .
in 1910 the " " , a group of young musicians around ravel , said they wanted to play music from before the schola period .
at first , satie was pleased that at least some of his works were receiving public attention .
young artists such as roland-manuel , and later georges auric , started to receive more of his attention than the " " .
with jean cocteau , satie started work on incidental music for a production of shakespeare 's " a midsummer night 's dream " .

jean cocteau gathered the six remaining members , forming the groupe des six dynasties which would later have access , but later again would fall out with most of its membersarth .
he became acquainted with other artists involved in the movement , such as francis picabia fourier .
in the first months of 1922 , he was surprised to find himself in the argument between tzara and andre breton about the true nature of avant-garde art .
the " " had formed around satie , taking the name from the relatively remote district of paris where satie lived .
he wrote the ballet " in collaboration with picabia , for the of rolf de mare .
in a simultaneous project , satie added music to the surrealist film " by rene clair , which was given as an intermezzo for " .
over the course of his 27 years in residence at arcueil , satie lived in stark simplicity , no one had ever visited his room .
after his death , satie 's friends discovered an apartment replete with squalor and chaos .
two grand pianos placed one on top of the other , the instrument used as storage for letters and parcels .
