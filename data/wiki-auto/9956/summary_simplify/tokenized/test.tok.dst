[CLS] his work was a precursor to later artistic movements such as minimal ##ism , repetitive music , and the theatre of the absurd . [SEP]
[CLS] later , he also referred to himself as a " ph ##ono ##metric ##ian " ( meaning " someone who measures sounds " ) , preferring this designation to that of " musician " , after having been called " a clumsy but subtle technician " in a book on contemporary french composers published in 1911 . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to his body of music , sat ##ie was " a think ##er with a gift of el ##o ##que ##nce " who left a remarkable set of writings , having contributed work for a range of publications , from the dad ##ais ##t " 39 ##1 " to the american culture chronicle " vanity fair " . [SEP]
[CLS] although in later life he pride ##d himself on publishing his work under his own name , in the late 19th century he appears to have used pseudonym ##s such as virgin ##ie le ##beau and francois de paul ##e in some of his published writings . [SEP]
[CLS] when sat ##ie was four years old , his family moved to paris , his father having been offered a translator ' s job in the capital . [SEP]
[CLS] after his mother ' s death in 1872 , he was sent ( at age 6 ) , together with his younger brother , conrad , back to hon ##fle ##ur to live with his paternal grandparents . [SEP]
[CLS] from the early 1880s onwards , sat ##ie started publishing salon compositions by his step - mother and himself , among others . [SEP]
[CLS] georges mathias , his professor of piano at the conservatoire , described his pupil ' s piano technique in flatly negative terms , " insignificant and labor ##ious " and " worthless " . [SEP]
[CLS] after being sent home for two and a half years , he was read ##mit ##ted to the conservatoire at the end of 1885 ( age 19 ) , but was unable to make a more favourable impression on his teachers than he had before , and , as a result , resolved to take up military service a year later . [SEP]
[CLS] however , sat ##ie ' s military career did not last very long ; within a few months he was discharged after deliberately in ##fect ##ing himself with bro ##nch ##itis . [SEP]
[CLS] he soon integrated with the artistic client ##ele of the le chat noir cafe - cabaret , and started publishing his " gym ##no ##ped ##ies " . [SEP]
[CLS] by mid - 1892 , sat ##ie had composed the first pieces in a composition ##al system of his own making ( " " ) , provided incident ##al music to a chi ##val ##ric es ##oteric play ( two " " ) , had his first hoax published ( announcing the premiere of " " , an anti - wagner ##ian opera he probably never composed ) , and broken from pe ##lad ##an , starting that autumn with the " us ##pu ##d " project , a " christian ballet " , in collaboration with . [SEP]
[CLS] during their relationship , sat ##ie composed the " dans ##es goth ##iques " as a means of calming his mind , and val ##ado ##n painted a portrait of sat ##ie , which she gave to him . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1893 , sat ##ie met the young maurice rave ##l for the first time , sat ##ie ' s style emerging in the first compositions of the young ##ster . [SEP]
[CLS] one of sat ##ie ' s own compositions of that period , " ve ##xa ##tions " , was to remain undisclosed until after his death . [SEP]
[CLS] as its only member , in the role of " parc ##ier et mai ##tre de chapel ##le " , he started to compose a " " ( later to become known as the " mess ##e des pau ##vres " ) , and wrote a flood of letters , articles and pamphlets showing off his self - assured ##ness in religious and artistic matters . [SEP]
[CLS] to give an example : he applied for membership in the academie francaise twice , leaving no doubt in the application letter that the board of that organisation ( presided over by camille saint - sa ##ens ) as much as owed him such membership . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1895 he inherited some money , allowing him to have more of his writings printed , and to change from wearing a priest - like habit to being the " velvet gentleman " . [SEP]
[CLS] by mid - 1896 , all of sat ##ie ' s financial means had vanished , and he had to move to cheaper and much smaller lodging ##s , first at the , and two years later , after he had composed the two first sets of " " in 1897 , to arc ##ue ##il , a suburb some five kilometres from the centre of paris . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period he re - established contact with his brother conrad for numerous practical and financial matters , disc ##los ##ing some of his inner feelings in the process . [SEP]
[CLS] in his later years , sat ##ie would reject all his cabaret music as vile and against his nature , but for the time being , it was an income . [SEP]
[CLS] only a few compositions that sat ##ie took seriously remain from this period : " jack in the box " , music to a pan ##tom ##ime by jules de ##pa ##qui ##t ( called a " " by sat ##ie ) ; " " , a short comic opera on a serious theme , text by " lord che ##min ##ot " ; " the dream ##y fish " , piano music to accompany a lost tale by che ##min ##ot ; and a few others that were mostly incomplete , hardly any of them staged , and none of them published at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] both " " and " the dream ##y fish " have been anal ##yse ##d by or ##nell ##a volta as containing elements of competition with claude de ##bus ##sy , of which de ##bus ##sy was probably not aware , sat ##ie not making this music public . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , de ##bus ##sy was having one of his first major successes with " " in 1902 , leading a few years later to ' who - was - precursor - to - whom ' debates between the two composers , in which maurice rave ##l would also get involved . [SEP]
[CLS] most of his friends were as dumb ##founded as the professors at the sc ##hol ##a when they heard about his new plan to return to the classrooms , especially as d ' indy was an admiring pupil of saint - sa ##ens , not particularly favoured by sat ##ie . [SEP]
[CLS] sat ##ie would follow these courses at the sc ##hol ##a , as a respected pupil , for more than five years , receiving a first ( intermediate ) diploma in 1908 . [SEP]
[CLS] something that becomes clear through these published compilations is that sat ##ie did not so much reject romantic ##ism and its expo ##nent ##s like wagner , but that he rejected certain aspects of it . [SEP]
[CLS] from his first composition to his last , he rejected the idea of musical development , in the strict definition of this term : the inter ##t ##win ##ing of different themes in a development section of a sonata form . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , his contra ##pu ##ntal and other works were very short ; the " new , modern " fu ##gues do not extend further than the exposition of the theme ( s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , he would say that he did not think it permitted that a composer take more time from his public than strictly necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] also mel ##od ##rama , in its historical meaning of the then popular romantic genre of " spoken words to a background of music " , was something sat ##ie avoided . [SEP]
[CLS] in the meantime , other changes had also taken place : sat ##ie was a member of a radical socialist party ( he later switched his membership to the communist party in that area after december 1920 ) , and had social ##ised with the arc ##ue ##il community : amongst other things , he had been involved in the " " work for children . [SEP]
[CLS] he also changed his appearance to that of the ' bourgeois function ##ary ' with bowler hat , umbrella , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] he channel ##led his medieval interests into a peculiar secret hobby : in a filing cabinet he maintained a collection of imaginary buildings , most of them described as being made out of some kind of metal , which he drew on little cards . [SEP]
[CLS] it was reproduced on the cover of robert or ##led ##ge ' s second book on the composer , " sat ##ie remembered " ( 1995 ) , but where this auto ##chrome was found has not been made known . [SEP]
[CLS] starting in 1912 , sat ##ie ' s new humorous miniatures for piano became very successful , and he wrote and published many of these over the next few years ( most of them premiered by the pianist ricardo vines ) . [SEP]
[CLS] his habit of accompanying the scores of his compositions with all kinds of written remarks was now well established , so that a few years later he had to insist that these not be read out during performances . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote in the first edition of " he ##ures sec ##ula ##ire ##s et instant ##ane ##es " , " to whom it may concern : ' i forbid anyone to read the text aloud during the musical performance . [SEP]
[CLS] in some ways , these compositions were very reminiscent of rossi ##ni ' s compositions from the final years of his life , grouped under the name pe ##ches de vie ##ille ##sse . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the acceleration in sat ##ie ' s life did not come so much from the success of his new piano pieces ; it was rave ##l who inadvertently triggered the characteristics of sat ##ie ' s remaining years and thus influenced the successive progressive artistic and cultural movements that rapidly manifested themselves in paris over the following years . [SEP]
[CLS] paris was seen as the artistic capital of the world , and the beginning of the new century appeared to have set many minds on fire . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1910 the " " , a group of young musicians around rave ##l , proclaimed their preference for sat ##ie ' s earlier work from before the sc ##hol ##a period , rein ##for ##cing the idea that sat ##ie had been a precursor of de ##bus ##sy . [SEP]
[CLS] at first , sat ##ie was pleased that at least some of his works were receiving public attention , but when he realised that this meant that his more recent work was overlooked or dismissed , he looked for other young artists who related better to his more recent ideas , so as to have better mutual support in creative activity . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , young artists such as roland - manuel , and later georges au ##ric , and jean co ##ct ##eau , started to receive more of his attention than the " " . [SEP]
[CLS] with jean co ##ct ##eau , whom he had first met in 1915 , sat ##ie started work on incident ##al music for a production of shakespeare ' s " a midsummer night ' s dream " , resulting in the " ci ##n ##q grimace ##s pour le song ##e d ' une nu ##it d ' et ##e " . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1916 , he and co ##ct ##eau worked on the ballet " parade " , which was premiered in 1917 by sergei dia ##ghi ##lev ' s ballet ##s russ ##es , with sets and costumes by pablo picasso , and choreography by leonid ##e mass ##ine . [SEP]
[CLS] jean co ##ct ##eau gathered the six remaining members , forming the group ##e des six ( to which sat ##ie would later have access , but later again would fall out with most of its members ) . [SEP]
[CLS] he became acquainted with other artists involved in the movement , such as francis pic ##abia ( later to become a surreal ##ist ) , andre der ##ain , marcel duc ##ham ##p , jean hugo and man ray , among others . [SEP]
[CLS] in the first months of 1922 , he was surprised to find himself en ##tangled in the argument between t ##zar ##a and andre breton about the true nature of avant - garde art , ep ##ito ##mise ##d by the failure of the cong ##res de paris . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , an " " had formed around sat ##ie , taking the name from the relatively remote district of paris where sat ##ie lived ; it included young musicians such as henri sa ##ug ##uet , maxim ##e jacob , roger des ##or ##mie ##re and henri cl ##ique ##t - pl ##eye ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] " mer ##cure " reunited him with picasso and mass ##ine for a mythological sp ##oof produced by count etienne de beaumont ' s so ##ire ##es de paris , and he wrote the " " ballet " " in collaboration with pic ##abia , for the of rolf de mare . [SEP]
[CLS] in a simultaneous project , sat ##ie added music to the surreal ##ist film " " by rene clair , which was given as an inter ##me ##zzo for " " . [SEP]
[CLS] over the course of his 27 years in residence at arc ##ue ##il , where sat ##ie lived in stark simplicity , no one had ever visited his room . [SEP]
[CLS] after his death , sat ##ie ' s friends discovered an apartment rep ##lete with sq ##ual ##or and chaos . [SEP]
[CLS] among many other un ##sor ##ted papers and miscellaneous items , it contained a large number of umbrella ##s , and two grand pianos placed one on top of the other , the upper instrument used as storage for letters and parcels . [SEP]
[CLS] they discovered compositions that were thought to have been lost or were totally unknown . [SEP]
[CLS] these were found behind the piano , in the pockets of his velvet suits , and in other odd places , and included " ve ##xa ##tions " ; " genevieve de bra ##bant " and other unpublished or unfinished stage works ; " the dream ##y fish " ; many sc ##hol ##a cantor ##um exercises ; a previously unseen set of " canine " piano pieces ; and several other works for piano , many untitled .
