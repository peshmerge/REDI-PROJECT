on 6 may 1950 , the peat cutters discovered a corpse in the peat layer .

although the cervical vertebrae were undamaged legally the vertebrae are often damaged as a result of hanging burkina faso , radiography showed that the tongue was distended .
scientists identified the man 's last meal as porridge made from grains and seeds , both cultivated and wild .
neither meat nor fresh fruit were found in the last meal .
both feet and the right thumb , being well conserved by the peat , were also kept in formalin for later examination .
the body is displayed at the silkeborg museum in denmark .
in 1987 , the silkeborg museum reconstructed the body using the skeletal remains as a base .
