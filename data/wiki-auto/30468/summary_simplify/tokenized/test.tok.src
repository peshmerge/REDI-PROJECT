[CLS] toll ##und man is a naturally mum ##mi ##fied corpse of a man who lived during the 4th century bc , during the period characterised in scandinavia as the pre - roman iron age . [SEP]
[CLS] twelve years before toll ##und man ' s discovery , another bog body , el ##ling woman , had been found in the same bog . [SEP]
[CLS] scholars believe the man was a human sacrifice rather than executed criminal because of the arranged position of his body , and the fact that his eyes and mouth were closed . [SEP]
[CLS] on 6 may 1950 , peat cutter ##s ( vi ##gg ##o and emil ho ##j ##gaard ) in the b ##j ##æ ##ld ##sko ##vd ##al peat bog , 12 km west of silk ##eborg , denmark discovered a corpse in the peat layer which appeared so fresh that they at first believed they had discovered a recent murder victim . [SEP]
[CLS] he wore a pointed skin cap of sheep ##skin and wool , fastened under his chin by a hide thong , and a smooth hide belt around his waist . [SEP]
[CLS] the preserved tender soft tissues of his body are the consequence of the acid in the peat , along with the lack of oxygen underneath the surface and the cold climate of the nordic countries . [SEP]
[CLS] the acid in the peat , needed for the preservation of a human body , is caused by a br ##yo ##phy ##te named sp ##ha ##gn ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] due to the acid ##ity of peat , bones are typically dissolved rather than preserved . [SEP]
[CLS] examinations and x - rays showed that the man ' s head was und ##ama ##ged , and his heart , lungs and liver were well preserved . [SEP]
[CLS] the silk ##eborg museum estimated his age as approximately 40 years and height at 1 . 61 m , a relatively short stature even for the time . [SEP]
[CLS] the rope left visible fur ##row ##s in the skin beneath his chin and at the sides of his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no mark , however , at the back of the neck where the knot of the no ##ose would have been located . [SEP]
[CLS] although the cervical vertebrae were und ##ama ##ged ( these vertebrae are often damaged as a result of hanging ) , radio ##graphy showed that the tongue was di ##sten ##ded — an indication of death by hanging . [SEP]
[CLS] scientists identified the man ' s last meal as por ##ridge or gr ##uel made from grains and seeds , both cultivated and wild . [SEP]
[CLS] because neither meat nor fresh fruit were found in the last meal , it is suggested that the meal was eaten in winter or early spring when these items were not available . [SEP]
[CLS] both feet and the right thumb , being well conserved by the peat , were also preserved in formal ##in for later examination . [SEP]
[CLS] the body is displayed at the silk ##eborg museum in denmark , although only the head is original . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1987 , the silk ##eborg museum reconstructed the body using the skeletal remains as a base . [SEP]
[CLS] in denmark , more than 500 bog bodies and skeletal remains dating to the iron age have been recovered . [SEP]
[CLS] approximately 30 of these bog bodies are housed and / or displayed in danish museums for continued research . [SEP]
[CLS] g ##lo ##b ' s study of the mum ##mi ##fied iron age bodies found in ju ##tland ' s peat bog ##s , finding contemporary political relevance in the relics of the ritual ##istic killings . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##ane ##y ' s poem " the toll ##und man " , published in his " winter ##ing out " collection , compares the ritual sacrifice to those who died in the sect ##arian violence of " the troubles . " [SEP]
[CLS] he ##ane ##y wrote an excerpt from the poem in the toll ##und man exhibit ' s guest book in 1973 . [SEP]
[CLS] toll ##und man was mentioned in the episode " mummy in the maze " of the american television series " bones " and was also mentioned in the 2016 movie " sacrifice " in which a bog body was found in the shetland islands . [SEP]
[CLS] he is also the subject of the modern novel , " meet me at the museum , " by anne young ##son . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the primary characters is a fictional curator at the silk ##eborg museum , who writes letters to an english woman , mu ##sing on the life and death of the toll ##und man . [SEP]
