Tollund Man is a naturally mummified corpse of a man who lived during the 4th century BC, during the period characterised in Scandinavia as the Pre-Roman Iron Age.
Twelve years before Tollund Man's discovery, another bog body, Elling Woman, had been found in the same bog.
Scholars believe the man was a human sacrifice rather than executed criminal because of the arranged position of his body, and the fact that his eyes and mouth were closed.
On 6 May 1950, peat cutters (Viggo and Emil Hojgaard) in the Bjældskovdal peat bog, 12 km west of Silkeborg, Denmark discovered a corpse in the peat layer which appeared so fresh that they at first believed they had discovered a recent murder victim.
He wore a pointed skin cap of sheepskin and wool, fastened under his chin by a hide thong, and a smooth hide belt around his waist.
The preserved tender soft tissues of his body are the consequence of the acid in the peat, along with the lack of oxygen underneath the surface and the cold climate of the Nordic countries.
The acid in the peat, needed for the preservation of a human body, is caused by a bryophyte named Sphagnum.
Due to the acidity of peat, bones are typically dissolved rather than preserved.
Examinations and X-rays showed that the man's head was undamaged, and his heart, lungs and liver were well preserved.
The Silkeborg Museum estimated his age as approximately 40 years and height at 1.61 m , a relatively short stature even for the time.
The rope left visible furrows in the skin beneath his chin and at the sides of his neck.
There was no mark, however, at the back of the neck where the knot of the noose would have been located.
Although the cervical vertebrae were undamaged (these vertebrae are often damaged as a result of hanging), radiography showed that the tongue was distended—an indication of death by hanging.
Scientists identified the man's last meal as porridge or gruel made from grains and seeds, both cultivated and wild.
Because neither meat nor fresh fruit were found in the last meal, it is suggested that the meal was eaten in winter or early spring when these items were not available.
Both feet and the right thumb, being well conserved by the peat, were also preserved in formalin for later examination.
The body is displayed at the Silkeborg Museum in Denmark, although only the head is original.
In 1987, the Silkeborg Museum reconstructed the body using the skeletal remains as a base.
In Denmark, more than 500 bog bodies and skeletal remains dating to the Iron Age have been recovered.
Approximately 30 of these bog bodies are housed and/or displayed in Danish museums for continued research.
Glob's study of the mummified Iron Age bodies found in Jutland's peat bogs, finding contemporary political relevance in the relics of the ritualistic killings.
Heaney's poem "The Tollund Man", published in his "Wintering Out" collection, compares the ritual sacrifice to those who died in the sectarian violence of "the Troubles."
Heaney wrote an excerpt from the poem in the Tollund Man exhibit's guest book in 1973.
Tollund Man was mentioned in the episode "Mummy in the Maze" of the American television series "Bones" and was also mentioned in the 2016 movie "Sacrifice" in which a bog body was found in the Shetland Islands.
He is also the subject of the modern novel, "Meet Me At the Museum," by Anne Youngson.
One of the primary characters is a fictional curator at the Silkeborg Museum, who writes letters to an English woman, musing on the life and death of the Tollund Man.
