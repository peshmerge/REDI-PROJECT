[CLS] toll ##und man is a naturally mum ##mi ##fied corpse of a man who lived during the 4th century bc , during the period characterised in scandinavia as the pre - roman iron age . [SEP]
[CLS] he was found in 1950 , preserved as a bog body , on the ju ##tland peninsula , in denmark . [SEP]
[CLS] the man ' s physical features were so well - preserved that he was mistaken at the time of discovery for a recent murder victim . [SEP]
[CLS] twelve years before toll ##und man ' s discovery , another bog body , el ##ling woman , had been found in the same bog . [SEP]
[CLS] scholars believe the man was a human sacrifice rather than executed criminal because of the arranged position of his body , and the fact that his eyes and mouth were closed . [SEP]
[CLS] on 6 may 1950 , peat cutter ##s ( vi ##gg ##o and emil ho ##j ##gaard ) in the b ##j ##æ ##ld ##sko ##vd ##al peat bog , 12 km west of silk ##eborg , denmark discovered a corpse in the peat layer which appeared so fresh that they at first believed they had discovered a recent murder victim . [SEP]
[CLS] the toll ##und man lay 50 m away from firm ground , buried under 2 m of peat , his body arranged in a fetal position . [SEP]
[CLS] he wore a pointed skin cap of sheep ##skin and wool , fastened under his chin by a hide thong , and a smooth hide belt around his waist . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , a no ##ose made of pl ##ai ##ted animal hide was drawn tight around his neck and trailed down his back . [SEP]
[CLS] other than these , the body was naked . [SEP]
[CLS] his hair was crop ##ped so short as to be almost entirely hidden by his cap . [SEP]
[CLS] there was short stubble ( 1 mm length ) on his chin and upper lip , suggesting that he had not shaved on the day of his death . [SEP]
[CLS] c radio ##carbon dating of toll ##und man indicated that he died in approximately 375 – 210 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] the preserved tender soft tissues of his body are the consequence of the acid in the peat , along with the lack of oxygen underneath the surface and the cold climate of the nordic countries . [SEP]
[CLS] the acid in the peat , needed for the preservation of a human body , is caused by a br ##yo ##phy ##te named sp ##ha ##gn ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] sp ##ha ##gn ##um fights against degradation due to resistant ph ##eno ##lic compounds contained in their cell walls . [SEP]
[CLS] due to the acid ##ity of peat , bones are typically dissolved rather than preserved . [SEP]
[CLS] examinations and x - rays showed that the man ' s head was und ##ama ##ged , and his heart , lungs and liver were well preserved . [SEP]
[CLS] the silk ##eborg museum estimated his age as approximately 40 years and height at 1 . 61 m , a relatively short stature even for the time . [SEP]
[CLS] it is likely that the body had sh ##run ##k in the bog . [SEP]
[CLS] on the initial autopsy report in 1950 , doctors concluded that toll ##und man died by hanging rather than st ##rang ##ulation . [SEP]
[CLS] the rope left visible fur ##row ##s in the skin beneath his chin and at the sides of his neck . [SEP]
[CLS] there was no mark , however , at the back of the neck where the knot of the no ##ose would have been located . [SEP]
[CLS] after a re - examination in 2002 , forensic scientists found further evidence to support these initial findings . [SEP]
[CLS] although the cervical vertebrae were und ##ama ##ged ( these vertebrae are often damaged as a result of hanging ) , radio ##graphy showed that the tongue was di ##sten ##ded — an indication of death by hanging . [SEP]
[CLS] the stomach and int ##est ##ines were examined and tests carried out on their contents . [SEP]
[CLS] scientists identified the man ' s last meal as por ##ridge or gr ##uel made from grains and seeds , both cultivated and wild . [SEP]
[CLS] approximately 40 kinds of seeds were identified , but the por ##ridge was primarily composed of four types : barley , fl ##ax , false fl ##ax ( " camel ##ina sat ##iva " ) and knot ##grass . [SEP]
[CLS] from the stage of digest ##ion it was concluded that the man had eaten 12 to 24 hours prior to his death . [SEP]
[CLS] por ##ridge ##s were common for people of this time . [SEP]
[CLS] because neither meat nor fresh fruit were found in the last meal , it is suggested that the meal was eaten in winter or early spring when these items were not available . [SEP]
[CLS] both feet and the right thumb , being well conserved by the peat , were also preserved in formal ##in for later examination . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1976 , the danish police made a finger ##print analysis , making toll ##und man ' s thumb ##print one of the oldest prints on record . [SEP]
[CLS] the body is displayed at the silk ##eborg museum in denmark , although only the head is original . [SEP]
[CLS] because conservation techniques for organic material were insufficient ##ly advanced in the early 1950s for the entire body to be preserved , the forensic examiner ##s suggested the head be severed and the rest of the body remain un ##pres ##erved . [SEP]
[CLS] subsequently , the body was des ##ic ##cated and the tissue disappeared . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1987 , the silk ##eborg museum reconstructed the body using the skeletal remains as a base . [SEP]
[CLS] as displayed today , the original head is attached to a replica of the body . [SEP]
[CLS] in denmark , more than 500 bog bodies and skeletal remains dating to the iron age have been recovered . [SEP]
[CLS] specimens from ju ##tland include the relatively well - preserved bo ##rre ##mos ##e bodies , hu ##ld ##rem ##ose woman , gr ##au ##ball ##e man on display at moe ##sg ##aar ##d museum near aarhus , and the similarly conserved harald ##sk ##æ ##r woman . [SEP]
[CLS] approximately 30 of these bog bodies are housed and / or displayed in danish museums for continued research . [SEP]
[CLS] nobel prize - winning irish poet seamus he ##ane ##y wrote a series of poems inspired by p . v . g ##lo ##b ' s study of the mum ##mi ##fied iron age bodies found in ju ##tland ' s peat bog ##s , finding contemporary political relevance in the relics of the ritual ##istic killings . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##ane ##y ' s poem " the toll ##und man " , published in his " winter ##ing out " collection , compares the ritual sacrifice to those who died in the sect ##arian violence of " the troubles . " [SEP]
[CLS] he ##ane ##y wrote an excerpt from the poem in the toll ##und man exhibit ' s guest book in 1973 . [SEP]
[CLS] british author margaret dr ##ab ##ble , in her 1989 novel , " a natural curiosity " , uses her characters ' obsession with the toll ##und man to provide a satirical criticism of margaret thatcher ' s modern england . [SEP]
[CLS] toll ##und man is featured in separate songs : " toll ##und man " ( 1995 ) by the american folk band the mountain goats and " curse of the toll ##und man " ( 2004 ) by the english rock band the darkness . [SEP]
[CLS] toll ##und man was mentioned in the episode " mummy in the maze " of the american television series " bones " and was also mentioned in the 2016 movie " sacrifice " in which a bog body was found in the shetland islands . [SEP]
[CLS] he is also the subject of the modern novel , " meet me at the museum , " by anne young ##son . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the primary characters is a fictional curator at the silk ##eborg museum , who writes letters to an english woman , mu ##sing on the life and death of the toll ##und man . [SEP]
