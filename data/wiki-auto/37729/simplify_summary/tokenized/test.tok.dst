[CLS] snow ##don ##ia is a mountainous region in northwestern wales and a national park of 82 ##3 sq ##mi in area . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the first to be designated of the three national parks in wales , in 1951 . [SEP]
[CLS] it contains the highest peaks in the united kingdom outside of scotland . [SEP]
[CLS] the english name for the area derives from snow ##don , which is the highest mountain in wales at 356 ##0 ft ( 1 , 08 ##5 m ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in welsh , the area is named . [SEP]
[CLS] a commonly held belief is that the name is derived from ( " eagle " ) , and thus means ' the ab ##ode / land of eagles ' , but recent evidence is that it means " highlands " , and is related to the latin ( to rise ) as leading welsh scholar sir proved . [SEP]
[CLS] the term first appeared in a manuscript in the 9th - century , in an account of the downfall of the semi - legendary 5th - century king ( vo ##rti ##ger ##n ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the middle ages the title " prince of wales and lord of snow ##don ##ia " was used by ; his grandfather used the title " prince of north wales and lord of snow ##don ##ia . " [SEP]
[CLS] before the boundaries of the national park were designated , " snow ##don ##ia " was generally used to refer to a smaller area , namely the upland area of northern centred on the snow ##don massif , whereas the national park covers an area more than twice that size extending far to the south into . [SEP]
[CLS] this is apparent in books published prior to 1951 , such as the classic travel ##og ##ue " wild wales " by george borrow ( 1862 ) and " the mountains of snow ##don ##ia " by h . carr & g . lister ( 1925 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] f . j . north , as editor of the book " snow ##don ##ia " ( 1949 ) , states " when the committee del ##ine ##ated provisional boundaries , they included areas some distance beyond snow ##don ##ia proper . " [SEP]
[CLS] the traditional snow ##don ##ia thus includes the ranges of snow ##don and its satellites , the , the , the and the moe ##l he ##bo ##g group . [SEP]
[CLS] it does not include the hills to the south of . [SEP]
[CLS] as ( see above ) , this area has a unique place in welsh history , tradition and culture . [SEP]
[CLS] snow ##don ##ia national park was established in 1951 as the third national park in britain , following the peak district and the lake district . [SEP]
[CLS] it covers 82 ##7 sq ##mi , and has 37 mi of coastline . [SEP]
[CLS] the snow ##don ##ia national park covers parts of the counties of g ##wyn ##edd and con ##wy . [SEP]
[CLS] the park is governed by the snow ##don ##ia national park authority , which is made up of local government and welsh representatives , and its main offices are at pen ##rh ##yn ##de ##ud ##rae ##th . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike national parks in other countries , snow ##don ##ia ( and other such parks in britain ) is made up of both public and private lands under central planning authority . [SEP]
[CLS] more than 26 , 000 people live within the park . [SEP]
[CLS] 58 . 6 % of the population could speak welsh in 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] while most of the land is either open or mountainous land , there is a significant amount of agricultural activity within the park . [SEP]
[CLS] since the local government re - organisation of 1998 , the park lies partly in the county of g ##wyn ##edd , and partly in the county borough of con ##wy . [SEP]
[CLS] it is governed by the 18 - member snow ##don ##ia national park authority ; nine members are appointed by g ##wyn ##edd , 3 by con ##wy , and the remaining six by the national assembly for wales to represent the national interest . [SEP]
[CLS] unusually , snow ##don ##ia national park has a hole in the middle , around the town of b ##la ##ena ##u ff ##est ##ini ##og , a slate quarry ##ing centre . [SEP]
[CLS] this was deliberately excluded from the park when it was set up to allow the development of new light industry to replace the reduced slate industry . [SEP]
[CLS] ( there is a similar situation in the peak district national park where the boundaries were drawn to exclude large built - up areas and industrial sites from the park with the town of bu ##xton and the adjacent quarries outside but surrounded on three sides by the park . ) [SEP]
[CLS] the snow ##don ##ia society is a registered charity formed in 1967 . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a voluntary group of people with an interest in the area and its protection . [SEP]
[CLS] amor ##y lo ##vin ##s led the successful 1970s opposition to stop rio tin ##to digging up the area for a massive mine . [SEP]
[CLS] research indicates that there were 3 . 67 million visitors to snow ##don ##ia national park in 2013 , with approximately 9 . 74 million tourist days spent in the park during that year . [SEP]
[CLS] total tourist expenditure was £ ##43 ##3 . 6 million in 2013 . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the hike ##rs in the area concentrate on snow ##don itself . [SEP]
[CLS] it is regarded as a fine mountain , but at times gets very crowded ; in addition the snow ##don mountain railway runs to the summit . [SEP]
[CLS] the other high mountains with their boulder - strewn summit ##s — as well as try ##fan , one of the few mountains in the uk south of scotland whose ascent needs hands as well as feet — are also very popular . [SEP]
[CLS] however , there are also some spectacular walks in snow ##don ##ia on the lower mountains , and they tend to be relatively un ##fr ##e ##quent ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] among hike ##rs ' favourites are y ga ##rn ( east of ll ##an ##ber ##is ) along the ridge to eli ##di ##r fa ##wr ; my ##ny ##dd tal - y - mig ##ned ##d ( west of snow ##don ) along the nan ##tl ##le ridge to my ##ny ##dd dr ##ws - y - coe ##d ; moe ##lwyn ma ##wr ( west of b ##la ##ena ##u ff ##est ##ini ##og ) ; and pen ll ##ith ##ri ##g y wr ##ach north of cape ##l cu ##ri ##g . [SEP]
[CLS] further south are y ll ##eth ##r in the rhino ##gy ##dd , and cad ##air id ##ris near do ##lge ##lla ##u . [SEP]
[CLS] the park has 147 ##9 mi of public foot ##path ##s , 164 mi of public br ##id ##le ##ways , and 46 mi of other public rights of way . [SEP]
[CLS] a large part of the park is also covered by right to roam laws . [SEP]
[CLS] the park ' s entire coastline is a special area of conservation , which runs from the ll ##yn peninsula down the mid - wales coast , the latter containing valuable sand dune systems . [SEP]
[CLS] the park ' s natural forests are of the mixed deciduous type , the common ##est tree being the welsh oak . [SEP]
[CLS] birch , ash , mountain - ash and hazel are also common . [SEP]
[CLS] the park also contains some large ( planted ) con ##iferous forested areas such as g ##wy ##di ##r forest near bet ##ws - y - coe ##d , although some areas , once harvested , are now increasingly being allowed to reg ##row naturally . [SEP]
[CLS] northern snow ##don ##ia is the only place in britain where the snow ##don lily ( " gage ##a ser ##ot ##ina " ) , an arctic – alpine plant , and the rainbow - coloured snow ##don beetle ( " ch ##rys ##olin ##a cereal ##is " ) are found , and the only place in the world where the snow ##don ##ia hawk ##weed " hi ##era ##ci ##um snow ##don ##iens ##e " grows . [SEP]
[CLS] a large proportion of the park is today under designation ( or under consideration for designation ) as sites of special scientific interest , national nature reserves , special areas of conservation , special protection areas , bio ##sphere and rams ##ar sites . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the major problems facing the park in recent years has been the growth of " r ##ho ##do ##den ##dron pont ##icum " . [SEP]
[CLS] this fast - growing invasive species has a tendency to take over and st ##if ##le native species . [SEP]
[CLS] it can form massive towering growth ##s and has a companion fungus that grows on its roots producing toxin ##s that are poisonous to any local flora and fauna for a seven - year period after the " r ##ho ##do ##den ##dron " in ##fest ##ations have been era ##dicated . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , there are a number of des ##olate landscapes . [SEP]
[CLS] snow ##don ##ia ' s importance in the conservation of habitat and wildlife in the region reflects in the fact that nearly 20 % of its total area is protected by uk and european law . [SEP]
[CLS] half of that area was set aside by the government under the european habitats directive as a special area of conservation . [SEP]
[CLS] rare mammals in the park include otter ##s , pole ##cats , and the feral goat , although the pine mart ##en has not been seen for many years . [SEP]
[CLS] rare birds include raven , red - billed cho ##ugh , pere ##grin ##e , os ##pre ##y , merlin and the red kite . [SEP]
[CLS] another of snow ##don ##ia ' s famous inhabitants is the snow ##don or rainbow beetle . [SEP]
[CLS] the park has three rams ##ar sites : the d ##y ##fi estuary bio ##sphere reserve , cw ##m id ##wal and ll ##yn te ##gi ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] snow ##don ##ia is one of the wet ##test parts of the united kingdom ; cr ##ib go ##ch in snow ##don ##ia is the wet ##test spot in the united kingdom , with an average rainfall of 44 ##7 ##3 mm a year over the past 30 years . [SEP]
