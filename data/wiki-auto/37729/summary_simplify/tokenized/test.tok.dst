[CLS] it was the first to be designated of the three national parks in wales , in 1951 . [SEP]
[CLS] the english name for the area derives from snow ##don , which is the highest mountain in wales at 356 ##0 ft ( 1 , 08 ##5 m ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a commonly held belief is that the name is derived from ( " eagle " ) , and thus means ' the ab ##ode / land of eagles ' , but recent evidence is that it means " highlands " , and is related to the latin ( to rise ) as leading welsh scholar sir proved . [SEP]
[CLS] the term first appeared in a manuscript in the 9th - century , in an account of the downfall of the semi - legendary 5th - century king ( vo ##rti ##ger ##n ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the middle ages the title " prince of wales and lord of snow ##don ##ia " was used by ; his grandfather used the title " prince of north wales and lord of snow ##don ##ia . " [SEP]
[CLS] before the boundaries of the national park were designated , " snow ##don ##ia " was generally used to refer to a smaller area , namely the upland area of northern centred on the snow ##don massif , whereas the national park covers an area more than twice that size extending far to the south into . [SEP]
[CLS] north , as editor of the book " snow ##don ##ia " ( 1949 ) , states " when the committee del ##ine ##ated provisional boundaries , they included areas some distance beyond snow ##don ##ia proper . " [SEP]
[CLS] the traditional snow ##don ##ia thus includes the ranges of snow ##don and its satellites , the , the , the and the moe ##l he ##bo ##g group . [SEP]
[CLS] as ( see above ) , this area has a unique place in welsh history , tradition and culture . [SEP]
[CLS] the park is governed by the snow ##don ##ia national park authority , which is made up of local government and welsh representatives , and its main offices are at pen ##rh ##yn ##de ##ud ##rae ##th . [SEP]
[CLS] while most of the land is either open or mountainous land , there is a significant amount of agricultural activity within the park . [SEP]
[CLS] since the local government re - organisation of 1998 , the park lies partly in the county of g ##wyn ##edd , and partly in the county borough of con ##wy . [SEP]
[CLS] it is governed by the 18 - member snow ##don ##ia national park authority ; nine members are appointed by g ##wyn ##edd , 3 by con ##wy , and the remaining six by the national assembly for wales to represent the national interest . [SEP]
[CLS] this was deliberately excluded from the park when it was set up to allow the development of new light industry to replace the reduced slate industry . [SEP]
[CLS] ( there is a similar situation in the peak district national park where the boundaries were drawn to exclude large built - up areas and industrial sites from the park with the town of bu ##xton and the adjacent quarries outside but surrounded on three sides by the park . ) [SEP]
[CLS] it is a voluntary group of people with an interest in the area and its protection . [SEP]
[CLS] amor ##y lo ##vin ##s led the successful 1970s opposition to stop rio tin ##to digging up the area for a massive mine . [SEP]
[CLS] research indicates that there were 3 . 67 million visitors to snow ##don ##ia national park in 2013 , with approximately 9 . 74 million tourist days spent in the park during that year . [SEP]
[CLS] it is regarded as a fine mountain , but at times gets very crowded ; in addition the snow ##don mountain railway runs to the summit . [SEP]
[CLS] the other high mountains with their boulder - strewn summit ##s — as well as try ##fan , one of the few mountains in the uk south of scotland whose ascent needs hands as well as feet — are also very popular . [SEP]
[CLS] however , there are also some spectacular walks in snow ##don ##ia on the lower mountains , and they tend to be relatively un ##fr ##e ##quent ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] among hike ##rs ' favourites are y ga ##rn ( east of ll ##an ##ber ##is ) along the ridge to eli ##di ##r fa ##wr ; my ##ny ##dd tal - y - mig ##ned ##d ( west of snow ##don ) along the nan ##tl ##le ridge to my ##ny ##dd dr ##ws - y - coe ##d ; moe ##lwyn ma ##wr ( west of b ##la ##ena ##u ff ##est ##ini ##og ) ; and pen ll ##ith ##ri ##g y wr ##ach north of cape ##l cu ##ri ##g . [SEP]
[CLS] the park ' s entire coastline is a special area of conservation , which runs from the ll ##yn peninsula down the mid - wales coast , the latter containing valuable sand dune systems . [SEP]
[CLS] the park also contains some large ( planted ) con ##iferous forested areas such as g ##wy ##di ##r forest near bet ##ws - y - coe ##d , although some areas , once harvested , are now increasingly being allowed to reg ##row naturally . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the major problems facing the park in recent years has been the growth of " r ##ho ##do ##den ##dron pont ##icum " . [SEP]
[CLS] it can form massive towering growth ##s and has a companion fungus that grows on its roots producing toxin ##s that are poisonous to any local flora and fauna for a seven - year period after the " r ##ho ##do ##den ##dron " in ##fest ##ations have been era ##dicated . [SEP]
[CLS] snow ##don ##ia ' s importance in the conservation of habitat and wildlife in the region reflects in the fact that nearly 20 % of its total area is protected by uk and european law . [SEP]
[CLS] half of that area was set aside by the government under the european habitats directive as a special area of conservation . [SEP]
[CLS] rare mammals in the park include otter ##s , pole ##cats , and the feral goat , although the pine mart ##en has not been seen for many years . [SEP]
[CLS] snow ##don ##ia is one of the wet ##test parts of the united kingdom ; cr ##ib go ##ch in snow ##don ##ia is the wet ##test spot in the united kingdom , with an average rainfall of 44 ##7 ##3 mm a year over the past 30 years . [SEP]
