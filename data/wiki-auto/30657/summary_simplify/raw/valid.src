The terabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information.
The unit symbol for the terabyte is TB.
A related unit, the tebibyte (TiB), using a binary prefix, is equal to 1024 bytes.
Despite the introduction of these standardized binary prefixes, the terabyte is still also commonly used in some computer operating systems, primarily Microsoft Windows, to denote (1024 or 2) bytes for disk drive capacity.
