The ACM A.M. Turing Award is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) to an individual selected for contributions "of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field".
The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science and the "Nobel Prize of computing".
The award is named after Alan Turing, a British mathematician and reader in mathematics at the University of Manchester.
Since 2014, the award has been accompanied by a prize of US$1 million, with financial support provided by Google.
The first recipient, in 1966, was Alan Perlis, of Carnegie Mellon University.
