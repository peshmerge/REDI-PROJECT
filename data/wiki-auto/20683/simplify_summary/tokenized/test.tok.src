[CLS] machine code is a computer program written in machine language instructions that can be executed directly by a computer ' s central processing unit ( cpu ) . [SEP]
[CLS] each instruction causes the cpu to perform a very specific task , such as a load , a store , a jump , or an al ##u operation on one or more units of data in cpu registers or memory . [SEP]
[CLS] machine code is a strictly numerical language which is intended to run as fast as possible , and may be regarded as the lowest - level representation of a compiled or assembled computer program or as a primitive and hardware - dependent programming language . [SEP]
[CLS] while it is possible to write programs directly in machine code , it is ted ##ious and error prone to manage individual bits and calculate numerical addresses and constant ##s manually . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , programs are very rarely written directly in machine code in modern contexts , but may be done for low level de ##bu ##gging , program patch ##ing ( especially when assemble ##r source is not available ) and assembly language di ##sas ##se ##mb ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] the overwhelming majority of practical programs today are written in higher - level languages or assembly language . [SEP]
[CLS] the source code is then translated to ex ##ec ##utable machine code by utilities such as compiler ##s , assemble ##rs , and link ##ers , with the important exception of interpreted programs , which are not translated into machine code . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the " interpreter " itself , which may be seen as an ex ##ec ##uto ##r or processor , performing the instructions of the source code , typically consists of directly ex ##ec ##utable machine code ( generated from assembly or high - level language source code ) . [SEP]
[CLS] machine code is by definition the lowest level of programming detail visible to the programmer , but internally many processors use micro ##code or opt ##imi ##se and transform machine code instructions into sequences of micro - ops . [SEP]
[CLS] this is not generally considered to be a machine code . [SEP]
[CLS] every processor or processor family has its own instruction set . [SEP]
[CLS] instructions are patterns of bits that by physical design correspond to different commands to the machine . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the instruction set is specific to a class of processors using ( mostly ) the same architecture . [SEP]
[CLS] successor or derivative processor designs often include all the instructions of a predecessor and may add additional instructions . [SEP]
[CLS] occasionally , a successor design will disco ##nti ##nu ##e or alter the meaning of some instruction code ( typically because it is needed for new purposes ) , affecting code compatibility to some extent ; even nearly completely compatible processors may show slightly different behavior for some instructions , but this is rarely a problem . [SEP]
[CLS] systems may also differ in other details , such as memory arrangement , operating systems , or peripheral devices . [SEP]
[CLS] because a program normally relies on such factors , different systems will typically not run the same machine code , even when the same type of processor is used . [SEP]
[CLS] a processor ' s instruction set may have all instructions of the same length , or it may have variable - length instructions . [SEP]
[CLS] how the patterns are organized varies strongly with the particular architecture and often also with the type of instruction . [SEP]
[CLS] most instructions have one or more op ##code fields which specifies the basic instruction type ( such as arithmetic , logical , jump , etc . ) and the actual operation ( such as add or compare ) and other fields that may give the type of the opera ##nd ( s ) , the addressing mode ( s ) , the addressing offset ( s ) or index , or the actual value itself ( such constant opera ##nds contained in an instruction are called " immediate ##s " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] not all machines or individual instructions have explicit opera ##nds . [SEP]
[CLS] an acc ##um ##ulator machine has a combined left opera ##nd and result in an implicit acc ##um ##ulator for most arithmetic instructions . [SEP]
[CLS] other architecture ##s ( such as 80 ##86 and the x ##86 - family ) have acc ##um ##ulator versions of common instructions , with the acc ##um ##ulator regarded as one of the general registers by longer instructions . [SEP]
[CLS] a stack machine has most or all of its opera ##nds on an implicit stack . [SEP]
[CLS] special purpose instructions also often lack explicit opera ##nds ( cpu ##id in the x ##86 architecture writes values into four implicit destination registers , for instance ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this distinction between explicit and implicit opera ##nds is important in code generators , especially in the register allocation and live range tracking parts . [SEP]
[CLS] a good code opt ##imi ##zer can track implicit as well as explicit opera ##nds which may allow more frequent constant propagation , constant folding of registers ( a register assigned the result of a constant expression freed up by replacing it by that constant ) and other code enhancement ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] a computer program is a list of instructions that can be executed by a central processing unit . [SEP]
[CLS] a program ' s execution is done in order for the cpu that is executing it to solve a specific problem and thus accomplish a specific result . [SEP]
[CLS] while simple processors are able to execute instructions one after another , super ##sca ##lar processors are capable of executing a variety of different instructions at once . [SEP]
[CLS] program flow may be influenced by special ' jump ' instructions that transfer execution to an instruction other than the numerical ##ly following one . [SEP]
[CLS] conditional jumps are taken ( execution continues at another address ) or not ( execution continues at the next instruction ) depending on some condition . [SEP]
[CLS] a much more read ##able rendition of machine language , called assembly language , uses mn ##emon ##ic codes to refer to machine code instructions , rather than using the instructions ' nu ##meric values directly . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , on the z ##ilo ##g z ##80 processor , the machine code cod ##ice _ 1 , which causes the cpu to dec ##rem ##ent the cod ##ice _ 2 processor register , would be represented in assembly language as cod ##ice _ 3 . [SEP]
[CLS] the mi ##ps architecture provides a specific example for a machine code whose instructions are always 32 bits long . [SEP]
[CLS] the general type of instruction is given by the " op " ( operation ) field , the highest 6 bits . [SEP]
[CLS] j - type ( jump ) and i - type ( immediate ) instructions are fully specified by " op " . [SEP]
[CLS] r - type ( register ) instructions include an additional field " fun ##ct " to determine the exact operation . [SEP]
[CLS] " rs " , " rt " , and " rd " indicate register opera ##nds ; " sham ##t " gives a shift amount ; and the " address " or " immediate " fields contain an opera ##nd directly . [SEP]
[CLS] in some computer architecture ##s , the machine code is implemented by an even more fundamental underlying layer called micro ##code , providing a common machine language interface across a line or family of different models of computer with widely different underlying data ##flow ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this is done to facilitate port ##ing of machine language programs between different models . [SEP]
[CLS] an example of this use is the ibm system / 360 family of computers and their successors . [SEP]
[CLS] with data ##flow path width ##s of 8 bits to 64 bits and beyond , they nevertheless present a common architecture at the machine language level across the entire line . [SEP]
[CLS] using micro ##code to implement an em ##ulator enables the computer to present the architecture of an entirely different computer . [SEP]
[CLS] the system / 360 line used this to allow port ##ing programs from earlier ibm machines to the new family of computers , e . g . an ibm 140 ##1 / 144 ##0 / 146 ##0 em ##ulator on the ibm s / 360 model 40 . [SEP]
[CLS] machine code is generally different from byte ##code ( also known as p - code ) , which is either executed by an interpreter or itself compiled into machine code for faster ( direct ) execution . [SEP]
[CLS] an exception is when a processor is designed to use a particular byte ##code directly as its machine code , such as is the case with java processors . [SEP]
[CLS] machine code and assembly code are sometimes called " native code " when referring to platform - dependent parts of language features or libraries . [SEP]
[CLS] the harvard architecture is a computer architecture with physically separate storage and signal pathways for the code ( instructions ) and data . [SEP]
[CLS] today , most processors implement such separate signal pathways for performance reasons but implement a modified harvard architecture , so they can support tasks like loading an ex ##ec ##utable program from disk storage as data and then executing it . [SEP]
[CLS] harvard architecture is contrasted to the von neumann architecture , where data and code are stored in the same memory which is read by the processor allowing the computer to execute commands . [SEP]
[CLS] from the point of view of a process , the " code space " is the part of its address space where the code in execution is stored . [SEP]
[CLS] in multi ##tas ##king systems this comprises the program ' s code segment and usually shared libraries . [SEP]
[CLS] in multi - thread ##ing environment , different threads of one process share code space along with data space , which reduces the overhead of context switching considerably as compared to process switching . [SEP]
[CLS] pamela samuel ##son wrote that machine code is so un ##rea ##dable that the united states copyright office cannot identify whether a particular encoded program is an original work of authorship ; however , the us copyright office " does " allow for copyright registration of computer programs and a program ' s machine code can sometimes be deco ##mp ##iled in order to make its functioning more easily understand ##able to humans . [SEP]
[CLS] cognitive science professor douglas ho ##fs ##tadt ##er has compared machine code to genetic code , saying that " looking at a program written in machine language is vaguely comparable to looking at a dna molecule atom by atom . " [SEP]
