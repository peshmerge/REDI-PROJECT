[CLS] machine code is a strictly numerical language which is intended to run as fast as possible , and may be regarded as the lowest - level representation of a compiled or assembled computer program or as a primitive and hardware - dependent programming language . [SEP]
[CLS] while it is possible to write programs directly in machine code , it is ted ##ious and error prone to manage individual bits and calculate numerical addresses and constant ##s manually . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , programs are very rarely written directly in machine code in modern contexts , but may be done for low level de ##bu ##gging , program patch ##ing ( especially when assemble ##r source is not available ) and assembly language di ##sas ##se ##mb ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] the source code is then translated to ex ##ec ##utable machine code by utilities such as compiler ##s , assemble ##rs , and link ##ers , with the important exception of interpreted programs , which are not translated into machine code . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the " interpreter " itself , which may be seen as an ex ##ec ##uto ##r or processor , performing the instructions of the source code , typically consists of directly ex ##ec ##utable machine code ( generated from assembly or high - level language source code ) . [SEP]
[CLS] machine code is by definition the lowest level of programming detail visible to the programmer , but internally many processors use micro ##code or opt ##imi ##se and transform machine code instructions into sequences of micro - ops . [SEP]
[CLS] instructions are patterns of bits that by physical design correspond to different commands to the machine . [SEP]
[CLS] successor or derivative processor designs often include all the instructions of a predecessor and may add additional instructions . [SEP]
[CLS] occasionally , a successor design will disco ##nti ##nu ##e or alter the meaning of some instruction code ( typically because it is needed for new purposes ) , affecting code compatibility to some extent ; even nearly completely compatible processors may show slightly different behavior for some instructions , but this is rarely a problem . [SEP]
[CLS] because a program normally relies on such factors , different systems will typically not run the same machine code , even when the same type of processor is used . [SEP]
[CLS] a processor ' s instruction set may have all instructions of the same length , or it may have variable - length instructions . [SEP]
[CLS] how the patterns are organized varies strongly with the particular architecture and often also with the type of instruction . [SEP]
[CLS] and the actual operation ( such as add or compare ) and other fields that may give the type of the opera ##nd ( s ) , the addressing mode ( s ) , the addressing offset ( s ) or index , or the actual value itself ( such constant opera ##nds contained in an instruction are called " immediate ##s " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] other architecture ##s ( such as 80 ##86 and the x ##86 - family ) have acc ##um ##ulator versions of common instructions , with the acc ##um ##ulator regarded as one of the general registers by longer instructions . [SEP]
[CLS] special purpose instructions also often lack explicit opera ##nds ( cpu ##id in the x ##86 architecture writes values into four implicit destination registers , for instance ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a good code opt ##imi ##zer can track implicit as well as explicit opera ##nds which may allow more frequent constant propagation , constant folding of registers ( a register assigned the result of a constant expression freed up by replacing it by that constant ) and other code enhancement ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] a computer program is a list of instructions that can be executed by a central processing unit . [SEP]
[CLS] a program ' s execution is done in order for the cpu that is executing it to solve a specific problem and thus accomplish a specific result . [SEP]
[CLS] while simple processors are able to execute instructions one after another , super ##sca ##lar processors are capable of executing a variety of different instructions at once . [SEP]
[CLS] a much more read ##able rendition of machine language , called assembly language , uses mn ##emon ##ic codes to refer to machine code instructions , rather than using the instructions ' nu ##meric values directly . [SEP]
[CLS] the mi ##ps architecture provides a specific example for a machine code whose instructions are always 32 bits long . [SEP]
[CLS] in some computer architecture ##s , the machine code is implemented by an even more fundamental underlying layer called micro ##code , providing a common machine language interface across a line or family of different models of computer with widely different underlying data ##flow ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] with data ##flow path width ##s of 8 bits to 64 bits and beyond , they nevertheless present a common architecture at the machine language level across the entire line . [SEP]
[CLS] machine code is generally different from byte ##code ( also known as p - code ) , which is either executed by an interpreter or itself compiled into machine code for faster ( direct ) execution . [SEP]
[CLS] an exception is when a processor is designed to use a particular byte ##code directly as its machine code , such as is the case with java processors . [SEP]
[CLS] today , most processors implement such separate signal pathways for performance reasons but implement a modified harvard architecture , so they can support tasks like loading an ex ##ec ##utable program from disk storage as data and then executing it . [SEP]
[CLS] harvard architecture is contrasted to the von neumann architecture , where data and code are stored in the same memory which is read by the processor allowing the computer to execute commands . [SEP]
[CLS] in multi - thread ##ing environment , different threads of one process share code space along with data space , which reduces the overhead of context switching considerably as compared to process switching . [SEP]
[CLS] pamela samuel ##son wrote that machine code is so un ##rea ##dable that the united states copyright office cannot identify whether a particular encoded program is an original work of authorship ; however , the us copyright office " does " allow for copyright registration of computer programs and a program ' s machine code can sometimes be deco ##mp ##iled in order to make its functioning more easily understand ##able to humans . [SEP]
[CLS] cognitive science professor douglas ho ##fs ##tadt ##er has compared machine code to genetic code , saying that " looking at a program written in machine language is vaguely comparable to looking at a dna molecule atom by atom . " [SEP]
