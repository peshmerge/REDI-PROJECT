[CLS] a round ( also called a perpetual canon " canon per ##pet ##u ##us " or infinite canon ) is a musical composition , a limited type of canon , in which a minimum of three voices sing exactly the same melody at the unison ( and may continue repeating it indefinitely ) , but with each voice beginning at different times so that different parts of the melody coincide in the different voices , but nevertheless fit harmon ##iously together . [SEP]
[CLS] it is one of the easiest forms of part singing , as only one line of melody need be learned by all parts , and is part of a popular musical tradition . [SEP]
[CLS] they were particularly favoured in glee clubs , which combined amateur singing with regular drinking ( , especially at 21 : " catch - singing is un ##thi ##nka ##ble without a supply of liquor to hand . . . " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest known rounds date from 12th century europe . [SEP]
[CLS] " row , row , row your boat " is a well - known children ' s round for four voices . [SEP]
[CLS] other well - known examples are " fr ##ere jacques " , " three blind mice " , and , more recently , " god only knows " by the beach boys ( the first usage in contemporary pop music ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a catch is a round in which a phrase that is not apparent in a single line of lyrics emerges when the lyrics are split between the different voices . [SEP]
[CLS] " perpetual canon " refers to the end of the melody leading back to the beginning , allowing easy and immediate repetition . [SEP]
[CLS] often , " the final cadence is the same as the first measure " . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " round " first appears in english in the early 16th century , though the form was found much earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] in medieval england , they were called rot ##a or ron ##dell ##us . [SEP]
[CLS] later , an alternative term was " round ##el " ( e . g . , david mel ##vill ' s manuscript " an ##e bu ##ik off round ##ell ##s " , aberdeen , 1612 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] special types of rounds are the " catch " ( a comic english form found from about 1580 to 1800 ) , and a specialized use of the word " canon " , in 17th - and 18th - century england design ##ating rounds with religious texts . [SEP]
[CLS] the oldest surviving round in english is " sum ##er is ic ##umen in " , which is for four voices , plus two bass voices singing a ground ( that is , a never - changing repeating part ) , also in canon . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the earliest known rounds are two works with latin texts found in the eleventh fa ##sc ##icle of the notre dame manuscript pl ##ute ##o 29 . 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] they are " leto let ##a con ##cio " ( a two - voice round ) and " o quan ##to con ##sil ##io " ( a four - voice round ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the former dates from before 118 ##0 and may be of german origin . [SEP]
[CLS] what makes a round work is that after the work is divided into equal - sized blocks of a few measures each , corresponding notes in each block either are the same , or are different notes in the same chord . [SEP]
[CLS] this is easiest with one chord , as in " row , row , row your boat " : a new part can join the singing by starting at the beginning whenever another part reaches any as ##ter ##isk in the above music . [SEP]
[CLS] if one ignores the sixteenth notes that pass between the main chords , every single note is in the tonic triad â€” in this case , a c , e , or g . [SEP]
[CLS] the second beat of each measure does not sketch out a tonic triad , it outlines a dominant seventh chord ( or " v ##7 chord " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] serious composers who turned their hand to the round format include thomas ar ##ne , john blow , william byrd , henry purcell , louis hardin , joseph haydn , wolfgang amadeus mozart , ludwig van beethoven , and benjamin britten ( for example , " old joe has gone fishing " , sung by the villagers in the pub to keep the peace , at the end of act 1 of " peter grimes " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] examples by j . s . bach include the regular canons , var . [SEP]
[CLS] 24 of the goldberg variations , and the perpetual canons , canon 7 of the musical offering and canon a 2 per ##pet ##u ##us ( bwv 107 ##5 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] several rounds are included amongst arnold sc ##hoe ##nberg ' s thirty - plus canons , which " within their natural limitations . . . are brilliant pieces , containing too much of the composer ' s characteristic ##ally unexpected blend of seriousness , humour , vi ##go ##ur and tenderness to remain un ##per ##formed " .
