[CLS] an ice age is a long period of reduction in the temperature of the earth ' s surface and atmosphere , resulting in the presence or expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers . [SEP]
[CLS] earth is currently in the qu ##ater ##nary g ##la ##ciation , known in popular terminology as the ice age . [SEP]
[CLS] individual pulses of cold climate are termed " glacial periods " ( or , alternatively , " glacial ##s " , " g ##la ##ciation ##s " , " glacial stages " , " st ##adia ##ls " , " stade ##s " , or colloquially , " ice ages " ) , and intermittent warm periods are called " inter ##gl ##ac ##ials " or " inter ##stad ##ials " with both climatic pulses part of the qu ##ater ##nary or other periods in earth ' s history . [SEP]
[CLS] in the terminology of g ##la ##cio ##logy , " ice age " implies the presence of extensive ice sheets in both northern and southern hemisphere ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] by this definition , we are in an inter ##gl ##ac ##ial period â€” the ho ##lo ##cene . [SEP]
[CLS] the amount of heat trapping gases emitted into earth ' s oceans and atmosphere will prevent the next ice age , which otherwise would begin in around 50 , 000 years , and likely more glacial cycles . [SEP]
