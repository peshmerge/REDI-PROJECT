An ice age is a long period of reduction in the temperature of the Earth's surface and atmosphere, resulting in the presence or expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers.
In the terminology of glaciology, "ice age" implies the presence of extensive ice sheets in both northern and southern hemispheres.
By this definition, we are in an interglacial periodâ€”the Holocene.
The amount of heat trapping gases emitted into Earth's oceans and atmosphere will prevent the next ice age, which otherwise would begin in around 50,000 years, and likely more glacial cycles.
