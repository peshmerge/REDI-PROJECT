[CLS] quantum mechanics ( q ##m ; also known as quantum physics , quantum theory , the wave mechanical model , or matrix mechanics ) , including quantum field theory , is a fundamental theory in physics which describes nature at the smallest scales of energy levels of atoms and sub ##ato ##mic particles . [SEP]
[CLS] classical physics , the physics existing before quantum mechanics , describes nature at ordinary ( macro ##scopic ) scale . [SEP]
[CLS] most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large ( macro ##scopic ) scale . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy , momentum , angular momentum and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values ( quan ##ti ##zation ) ; objects have characteristics of both particles and waves ( wave - particle dual ##ity ) ; and there are limits to the precision with which quantities can be measured ( uncertainty principle ) . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum mechanics gradually arose from theories to explain observations which could not be reconciled with classical physics , such as max planck ' s solution in 1900 to the black - body radiation problem , and from the correspondence between energy and frequency in albert einstein ' s 1905 paper which explained the photo ##ele ##ctric effect . [SEP]
[CLS] early quantum theory was profoundly re - conceived in the mid - 1920s by erwin sc ##hr ##od ##inger , werner he ##isen ##berg , max born and others . [SEP]
[CLS] the modern theory is formulated in various specially developed mathematical formal ##isms . [SEP]
[CLS] in one of them , a mathematical function , the wave function , provides information about the probability amplitude of position , momentum , and other physical properties of a particle . [SEP]
[CLS] important applications of quantum theory include quantum chemistry , quantum optics , quantum computing , super ##con ##du ##cting magnet ##s , light - emi ##tting di ##odes , and the laser , the trans ##isto ##r and semiconductor ##s such as the micro ##pro ##ces ##sor , medical and research imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopy . [SEP]
[CLS] explanations for many biological and physical phenomena are rooted in the nature of the chemical bond , most notably the macro - molecule dna . [SEP]
[CLS] scientific inquiry into the wave nature of light began in the 17th and 18th centuries , when scientists such as robert hook ##e , christi ##aan hu ##y ##gens and leon ##hard eu ##ler proposed a wave theory of light based on experimental observations . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1803 , thomas young , an english poly ##mat ##h , performed the famous double - slit experiment that he later described in a paper titled " on the nature of light and colours " . [SEP]
[CLS] this experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1838 , michael far ##aday discovered cat ##ho ##de rays . [SEP]
[CLS] these studies were followed by the 1859 statement of the black - body radiation problem by gustav ki ##rch ##hoff , the 1877 suggestion by ludwig bolt ##zman ##n that the energy states of a physical system can be discrete , and the 1900 quantum hypothesis of max planck . [SEP]
[CLS] planck ' s hypothesis that energy is radiated and absorbed in discrete " quan ##ta " ( or energy packets ) precisely matched the observed patterns of black - body radiation . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1896 , wilhelm wien empirical ##ly determined a distribution law of black - body radiation , known as wien ' s law in his honor . [SEP]
[CLS] ludwig bolt ##zman ##n independently arrived at this result by considerations of maxwell ' s equations . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it was valid only at high frequencies and under ##est ##imated the ra ##dian ##ce at low frequencies . [SEP]
[CLS] later , planck corrected this model using bolt ##zman ##n ' s statistical interpretation of the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mics and proposed what is now called planck ' s law , which led to the development of quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] following max planck ' s solution in 1900 to the black - body radiation problem ( reported 1859 ) , albert einstein offered a quantum - based theory to explain the photo ##ele ##ctric effect ( 1905 , reported 1887 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] around 1900 – 1910 , the atomic theory and the corpus ##cular theory of light first came to be widely accepted as scientific fact ; these latter theories can be viewed as quantum theories of matter and electromagnetic radiation , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] among the first to study quantum phenomena in nature were arthur compton , c . v . rama ##n , and pieter zee ##man , each of whom has a quantum effect named after him . [SEP]
[CLS] robert andrews mill ##ika ##n studied the photo ##ele ##ctric effect experimental ##ly , and albert einstein developed a theory for it . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time , ernest rutherford experimental ##ly discovered the nuclear model of the atom , for which ni ##els bo ##hr developed his theory of the atomic structure , which was later confirmed by the experiments of henry mo ##sel ##ey . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1913 , peter de ##by ##e extended ni ##els bo ##hr ' s theory of atomic structure , introducing elliptical orbits , a concept also introduced by arnold somme ##rf ##eld . [SEP]
[CLS] this phase is known as old quantum theory . [SEP]
[CLS] where " h " is planck ' s constant . [SEP]
[CLS] planck cautiously insisted that this was simply an aspect of the processes of absorption and emission of radiation and had nothing to do with the " physical reality " of the radiation itself . [SEP]
[CLS] in fact , he considered his quantum hypothesis a mathematical trick to get the right answer rather than a sizable discovery . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in 1905 albert einstein interpreted planck ' s quantum hypothesis realistic ##ally and used it to explain the photo ##ele ##ctric effect , in which shining light on certain materials can e ##ject electrons from the material . [SEP]
[CLS] he won the 1921 nobel prize in physics for this work . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein further developed this idea to show that an electromagnetic wave such as light could also be described as a particle ( later called the photon ) , with a discrete quantum of energy that was dependent on its frequency . [SEP]
[CLS] the foundations of quantum mechanics were established during the first half of the 20th century by max planck , ni ##els bo ##hr , werner he ##isen ##berg , louis de bro ##gli ##e , arthur compton , albert einstein , erwin sc ##hr ##od ##inger , max born , john von neumann , paul dir ##ac , enrico fe ##rmi , wolfgang paul ##i , max von lau ##e , freeman d ##yson , david hilbert , wilhelm wien , sat ##yen ##dra nat ##h bose , arnold somme ##rf ##eld , and . [SEP]
[CLS] the copenhagen interpretation of ni ##els bo ##hr became widely accepted . [SEP]
[CLS] in the mid - 1920s , developments in quantum mechanics led to its becoming the standard formulation for atomic physics . [SEP]
[CLS] in the summer of 1925 , bo ##hr and he ##isen ##berg published results that closed the old quantum theory . [SEP]
[CLS] out of def ##erence to their particle - like behavior in certain processes and measurements , light quan ##ta came to be called photon ##s ( 1926 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1926 erwin sc ##hr ##od ##inger suggested a partial differential equation for the wave functions of particles like electrons . [SEP]
[CLS] and when effectively restricted to a finite region , this equation allowed only certain modes , corresponding to discrete quantum states – whose properties turned out to be exactly the same as implied by matrix mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] from einstein ' s simple post ##ulation was born a flu ##rry of debating , theo ##riz ##ing , and testing . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the entire field of quantum physics emerged , leading to its wider acceptance at the fifth sol ##va ##y conference in 1927 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was found that sub ##ato ##mic particles and electromagnetic waves are neither simply particle nor wave but have certain properties of each . [SEP]
[CLS] this originated the concept of wave – particle dual ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1930 , quantum mechanics had been further unified and formal ##ized by the work of david hilbert , paul dir ##ac and john von neumann with greater emphasis on measurement , the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality , and philosophical speculation about the ' observer ' . [SEP]
[CLS] it has since per ##me ##ated many disciplines , including quantum chemistry , quantum electronics , quantum optics , and quantum information science . [SEP]
[CLS] its speculative modern developments include string theory and quantum gravity theories . [SEP]
[CLS] it also provides a useful framework for many features of the modern periodic table of elements , and describes the behaviors of atoms during chemical bonding and the flow of electrons in computer semiconductor ##s , and therefore plays a crucial role in many modern technologies . [SEP]
[CLS] while quantum mechanics was constructed to describe the world of the very small , it is also needed to explain some macro ##scopic phenomena such as super ##con ##du ##ctors , and super ##fl ##uid ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " quantum " derives from the latin , meaning " how great " or " how much " . [SEP]
[CLS] in quantum mechanics , it refers to a discrete unit assigned to certain physical quantities such as the energy of an atom at rest ( see figure 1 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the discovery that particles are discrete packets of energy with wave - like properties led to the branch of physics dealing with atomic and sub ##ato ##mic systems which is today called quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] it under ##lies the mathematical framework of many fields of physics and chemistry , including condensed matter physics , solid - state physics , atomic physics , molecular physics , computational physics , computational chemistry , quantum chemistry , particle physics , nuclear chemistry , and nuclear physics . [SEP]
[CLS] some fundamental aspects of the theory are still actively studied . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum mechanics is essential to understanding the behavior of systems at atomic length scales and smaller . [SEP]
[CLS] if the physical nature of an atom were solely described by classical mechanics , electrons would not " orbit " the nucleus , since orbiting electrons emi ##t radiation ( due to circular motion ) and would quickly col ##lide with the nucleus due to this loss of energy . [SEP]
[CLS] this framework was unable to explain the stability of atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , electrons remain in an uncertain , non - deter ##mini ##stic , " smeared " , pro ##ba ##bilis ##tic wave – particle orbital about the nucleus , def ##ying the traditional assumptions of classical mechanics and electro ##ma ##gne ##tism . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum mechanics was initially developed to provide a better explanation and description of the atom , especially the differences in the spectra of light emitted by different isotope ##s of the same chemical element , as well as sub ##ato ##mic particles . [SEP]
[CLS] in short , the quantum - mechanical atomic model has succeeded spectacular ##ly in the realm where classical mechanics and electro ##ma ##gne ##tism fa ##lter . [SEP]
[CLS] in the mathematical ##ly rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics developed by paul dir ##ac , david hilbert , john von neumann , and hermann we ##yl , the possible states of a quantum mechanical system are symbol ##ized as unit vectors ( called " state vectors " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] formally , these vectors are elements of a complex sep ##arable hilbert space – variously called the " state space " or the " associated hilbert space " of the system – that is well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 ( the phase factor ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , the possible states are points in the projective space of a hilbert space , usually called the complex projective space . [SEP]
[CLS] the exact nature of this hilbert space is dependent on the system – for example , the state space for position and momentum states is the space of square - int ##eg ##rable functions , while the state space for the spin of a single proton is just the product of two complex planes . [SEP]
[CLS] each ob ##ser ##vable is represented by a maximal ##ly hermit ##ian ( precisely : by a self - ad ##jo ##int ) linear operator acting on the state space . [SEP]
[CLS] each e ##igen ##sta ##te of an ob ##ser ##vable corresponds to an e ##igen ##ve ##ctor of the operator , and the associated e ##igen ##val ##ue corresponds to the value of the ob ##ser ##vable in that e ##igen ##sta ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] if the operator ' s spectrum is discrete , the ob ##ser ##vable can attain only those discrete e ##igen ##val ##ues . [SEP]
[CLS] in the formal ##ism of quantum mechanics , the state of a system at a given time is described by a complex wave function , also referred to as state vector in a complex vector space . [SEP]
[CLS] this abstract mathematical object allows for the calculation of pro ##ba ##bilities of outcomes of concrete experiments . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , it allows one to compute the probability of finding an electron in a particular region around the nucleus at a particular time . [SEP]
[CLS] contrary to classical mechanics , one can never make simultaneous predictions of con ##ju ##gate variables , such as position and momentum , to arbitrary precision . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , electrons may be considered ( to a certain probability ) to be located somewhere within a given region of space , but with their exact positions unknown . [SEP]
[CLS] con ##tour ##s of constant probability density , often referred to as " clouds " , may be drawn around the nucleus of an atom to conceptual ##ize where the electron might be located with the most probability . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##isen ##berg ' s uncertainty principle quan ##ti ##fies the inability to precisely locate the particle given its con ##ju ##gate momentum . [SEP]
[CLS] according to one interpretation , as the result of a measurement , the wave function containing the probability information for a system collapses from a given initial state to a particular e ##igen ##sta ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] the possible results of a measurement are the e ##igen ##val ##ues of the operator representing the ob ##ser ##vable – which explains the choice of " hermit ##ian " operators , for which all the e ##igen ##val ##ues are real . [SEP]
[CLS] the probability distribution of an ob ##ser ##vable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##isen ##berg ' s uncertainty principle is represented by the statement that the operators corresponding to certain ob ##ser ##vable ##s do not com ##mute . [SEP]
[CLS] the pro ##ba ##bilis ##tic nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement . [SEP]
[CLS] this is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the central topic in the famous bo ##hr – einstein debates , in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of thought experiments . [SEP]
[CLS] in the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics , the question of what constitutes a " measurement " has been extensively studied . [SEP]
[CLS] newer interpretations of quantum mechanics have been formulated that do away with the concept of " wave function collapse " ( see , for example , the relative state interpretation ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the basic idea is that when a quantum system interact ##s with a measuring apparatus , their respective wave functions become en ##tangled , so that the original quantum system cease ##s to exist as an independent entity . [SEP]
[CLS] for details , see the article on measurement in quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , quantum mechanics does not assign definite values . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , it makes a prediction using a probability distribution ; that is , it describes the probability of obtaining the possible outcomes from measuring an ob ##ser ##vable . [SEP]
[CLS] often these results are sk ##ew ##ed by many causes , such as dense probability clouds . [SEP]
[CLS] probability clouds are approximate ( but better than the bo ##hr model ) whereby electron location is given by a probability function , the wave function e ##igen ##val ##ue , such that the probability is the squared mod ##ulus of the complex amplitude , or quantum state nuclear attraction . [SEP]
[CLS] naturally , these pro ##ba ##bilities will depend on the quantum state at the " instant " of the measurement . [SEP]
[CLS] hence , uncertainty is involved in the value . [SEP]
[CLS] there are , however , certain states that are associated with a definite value of a particular ob ##ser ##vable . [SEP]
[CLS] these are known as e ##igen ##sta ##tes of the ob ##ser ##vable ( " e ##igen " can be translated from german as meaning " inherent " or " characteristic " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the everyday world , it is natural and intuitive to think of everything ( every ob ##ser ##vable ) as being in an e ##igen ##sta ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] everything appears to have a definite position , a definite momentum , a definite energy , and a definite time of occurrence . [SEP]
[CLS] however , quantum mechanics does not pin ##point the exact values of a particle ' s position and momentum ( since they are con ##ju ##gate pairs ) or its energy and time ( since they too are con ##ju ##gate pairs ) . [SEP]
[CLS] rather , it provides only a range of pro ##ba ##bilities in which that particle might be given its momentum and momentum probability . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , it is helpful to use different words to describe states having " uncertain " values and states having " definite " values ( e ##igen ##sta ##tes ) . [SEP]
[CLS] usually , a system will not be in an e ##igen ##sta ##te of the ob ##ser ##vable ( particle ) we are interested in . [SEP]
[CLS] however , if one measures the ob ##ser ##vable , the wave function will instant ##aneous ##ly be an e ##igen ##sta ##te ( or " generalized " e ##igen ##sta ##te ) of that ob ##ser ##vable . [SEP]
[CLS] this process is known as wave function collapse , a controversial and much - debated process that involves expanding the system under study to include the measurement device . [SEP]
[CLS] if one knows the corresponding wave function at the instant before the measurement , one will be able to compute the probability of the wave function collapsing into each of the possible e ##igen ##sta ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the free particle in the previous example will usually have a wave function that is a wave packet centered around some mean position " x " ( neither an e ##igen ##sta ##te of position nor of momentum ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when one measures the position of the particle , it is impossible to predict with certainty the result . [SEP]
[CLS] it is probable , but not certain , that it will be near " x " , where the amplitude of the wave function is large . [SEP]
[CLS] after the measurement is performed , having obtained some result " x " , the wave function collapses into a position e ##igen ##sta ##te centered at " x " . [SEP]
[CLS] the time evolution of a quantum state is described by the sc ##hr ##od ##inger equation , in which the hamilton ##ian ( the operator corresponding to the total energy of the system ) generates the time evolution . [SEP]
[CLS] the time evolution of wave functions is deter ##mini ##stic in the sense that – given a wave function at an " initial " time – it makes a definite prediction of what the wave function will be at any " later " time . [SEP]
[CLS] during a measurement , on the other hand , the change of the initial wave function into another , later wave function is not deter ##mini ##stic , it is unpredictable ( i . e . , random ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a time - evolution simulation can be seen here . [SEP]
[CLS] wave functions change as time progresses . [SEP]
[CLS] the sc ##hr ##od ##inger equation describes how wave functions change in time , playing a role similar to newton ' s second law in classical mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] the sc ##hr ##od ##inger equation , applied to the aforementioned example of the free particle , predict ##s that the center of a wave packet will move through space at a constant velocity ( like a classical particle with no forces acting on it ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses , which means that the position becomes more uncertain with time . [SEP]
[CLS] this also has the effect of turning a position e ##igen ##sta ##te ( which can be thought of as an infinitely sharp wave packet ) into a broad ##ened wave packet that no longer represents a ( definite , certain ) position e ##igen ##sta ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] some wave functions produce probability distributions that are constant , or independent of time – such as when in a stationary state of constant energy , time vanish ##es in the absolute square of the wave function . [SEP]
[CLS] many systems that are treated dynamic ##ally in classical mechanics are described by such " static " wave functions . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , a single electron in an une ##x ##cite ##d atom is pictured classical ##ly as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus , whereas in quantum mechanics , it is described by a static , spherical ##ly symmetric wave function surrounding the nucleus ( however , only the lowest angular momentum states , labeled " s " , are spherical ##ly symmetric . ) [SEP]
[CLS] the sc ##hr ##od ##inger equation acts on the " entire " probability amplitude , not merely its absolute value . [SEP]
[CLS] whereas the absolute value of the probability amplitude en ##codes information about pro ##ba ##bilities , its phase en ##codes information about the interference between quantum states . [SEP]
[CLS] this gives rise to the " wave - like " behavior of quantum states . [SEP]
[CLS] as it turns out , analytic solutions of the sc ##hr ##od ##inger equation are available for only a very small number of relatively simple model hamilton ##ians , of which the quantum harmonic os ##ci ##lla ##tor , the particle in a box , the di ##hy ##dro ##gen cat ##ion , and the hydrogen atom are the most important representatives . [SEP]
[CLS] even the helium atom – which contains just one more electron than does the hydrogen atom – has def ##ied all attempts at a fully analytic treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] there exist several techniques for generating approximate solutions , however . [SEP]
[CLS] in the important method known as per ##tur ##bation theory , one uses the analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to generate a result for a more complicated model that is related to the simpler model by ( for one example ) the addition of a weak potential energy . [SEP]
[CLS] another method is the " semi - classical equation of motion " approach , which applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces only weak ( small ) deviation ##s from classical behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] these deviation ##s can then be computed based on the classical motion . [SEP]
[CLS] this approach is particularly important in the field of quantum chaos . [SEP]
[CLS] there are numerous mathematical ##ly equivalent formulation ##s of quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the oldest and most commonly used formulation ##s is the " transformation theory " proposed by paul dir ##ac , which un ##ifies and general ##izes the two earliest formulation ##s of quantum mechanics – matrix mechanics ( invented by werner he ##isen ##berg ) and wave mechanics ( invented by erwin sc ##hr ##od ##inger ) . [SEP]
[CLS] especially since werner he ##isen ##berg was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 1932 for the creation of quantum mechanics , the role of max born in the development of q ##m was overlooked until the 1954 nobel award . [SEP]
[CLS] the role is noted in a 2005 biography of born , which recounts his role in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics , and the use of probability amplitude ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##isen ##berg himself acknowledges having learned matrices from born , as published in a 1940 " fest ##sch ##rift " honoring max planck . [SEP]
[CLS] in the matrix formulation , the instant ##aneous state of a quantum system en ##codes the pro ##ba ##bilities of its me ##asurable properties , or " ob ##ser ##vable ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] examples of ob ##ser ##vable ##s include energy , position , momentum , and angular momentum . [SEP]
[CLS] ob ##ser ##vable ##s can be either continuous ( e . g . , the position of a particle ) or discrete ( e . g . , the energy of an electron bound to a hydrogen atom ) . [SEP]
[CLS] an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics is fey ##n ##man ' s path integral formulation , in which a quantum - mechanical amplitude is considered as a sum over all possible classical and non - classical paths between the initial and final states . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the quantum - mechanical counterpart of the action principle in classical mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] the rules of quantum mechanics are fundamental . [SEP]
[CLS] they assert that the state space of a system is a hilbert space ( crucial ##ly , that the space has an inner product ) and that ob ##ser ##vable ##s of the system are hermit ##ian operators acting on vectors in that space – although they do not tell us which hilbert space or which operators . [SEP]
[CLS] these can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system . [SEP]
[CLS] an important guide for making these choices is the correspondence principle , which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical mechanics when a system moves to higher energies or , equivalent ##ly , larger quantum numbers , i . e . whereas a single particle exhibits a degree of random ##ness , in systems incorporating millions of particles averaging takes over and , at the high energy limit , the statistical probability of random behaviour approaches zero . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , classical mechanics is simply a quantum mechanics of large systems . [SEP]
[CLS] this " high energy " limit is known as the " classical " or " correspondence limit " . [SEP]
[CLS] one can even start from an established classical model of a particular system , then attempt to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit . [SEP]
[CLS] when quantum mechanics was originally formulated , it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was non - re ##lat ##ivist ##ic classical mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , the well - known model of the quantum harmonic os ##ci ##lla ##tor uses an explicitly non - re ##lat ##ivist ##ic expression for the kinetic energy of the os ##ci ##lla ##tor , and is thus a quantum version of the classical harmonic os ##ci ##lla ##tor . [SEP]
[CLS] early attempts to merge quantum mechanics with special relativity involved the replacement of the sc ##hr ##od ##inger equation with a co ##var ##ian ##t equation such as the klein – gordon equation or the dir ##ac equation . [SEP]
[CLS] while these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results , they had certain un ##sat ##is ##factory qualities stemming from their neglect of the re ##lat ##ivist ##ic creation and ann ##ih ##ilation of particles . [SEP]
[CLS] a fully re ##lat ##ivist ##ic quantum theory required the development of quantum field theory , which applies quan ##ti ##zation to a field ( rather than a fixed set of particles ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the first complete quantum field theory , quantum electro ##dy ##nami ##cs , provides a fully quantum description of the electromagnetic interaction . [SEP]
[CLS] the full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electro ##dy ##nami ##c systems . [SEP]
[CLS] a simpler approach , one that has been employed since the inception of quantum mechanics , is to treat charged particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical electromagnetic field . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the elementary quantum model of the hydrogen atom describes the electric field of the hydrogen atom using a classical formula _ 2 co ##ulo ##mb potential . [SEP]
[CLS] this " semi - classical " approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role , such as in the emission of photon ##s by charged particles . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum field theories for the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have also been developed . [SEP]
[CLS] the quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called quantum ch ##rom ##od ##yna ##mics , and describes the interactions of sub ##nu ##cle ##ar particles such as qu ##ark ##s and g ##lu ##ons . [SEP]
[CLS] the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were unified , in their quan ##tized forms , into a single quantum field theory ( known as electro ##we ##ak theory ) , by the physicist ##s abd ##us sal ##am , sheldon g ##lash ##ow and steven wei ##nberg . [SEP]
[CLS] these three men shared the nobel prize in physics in 1979 for this work . [SEP]
[CLS] it has proven difficult to construct quantum models of gravity , the remaining fundamental force . [SEP]
[CLS] semi - classical approximation ##s are work ##able , and have led to predictions such as hawk ##ing radiation . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the formulation of a complete theory of quantum gravity is hind ##ered by apparent inc ##omp ##ati ##bilities between general relativity ( the most accurate theory of gravity currently known ) and some of the fundamental assumptions of quantum theory . [SEP]
[CLS] the resolution of these inc ##omp ##ati ##bilities is an area of active research , and theories such as string theory are among the possible candidates for a future theory of quantum gravity . [SEP]
[CLS] classical mechanics has also been extended into the complex domain , with complex classical mechanics exhibiting behaviors similar to quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimental ##ly to an extremely high degree of accuracy . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the correspondence principle between classical and quantum mechanics , all objects obey the laws of quantum mechanics , and classical mechanics is just an approximation for large systems of objects ( or a statistical quantum mechanics of a large collection of particles ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the laws of classical mechanics thus follow from the laws of quantum mechanics as a statistical average at the limit of large systems or large quantum numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] however , chaotic systems do not have good quantum numbers , and quantum chaos studies the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions in these systems . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum co ##her ##ence is an essential difference between classical and quantum theories as illustrated by the einstein – pod ##ols ##ky – rosen ( ep ##r ) paradox – an attack on a certain philosophical interpretation of quantum mechanics by an appeal to local realism . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum interference involves adding together " probability amplitude ##s " , whereas classical " waves " in ##fer that there is an adding together of " int ##ens ##ities " . [SEP]
[CLS] for microscopic bodies , the extension of the system is much smaller than the co ##her ##ence length , which gives rise to long - range en ##tangle ##ment and other non ##lo ##cal phenomena characteristic of quantum systems . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum co ##her ##ence is not typically evident at macro ##scopic scales , though an exception to this rule may occur at extremely low temperatures ( i . e . approaching absolute zero ) at which quantum behavior may manifest itself macro ##scopic ##ally . [SEP]
[CLS] a big difference between classical and quantum mechanics is that they use very different kin ##ema ##tic descriptions . [SEP]
[CLS] in ni ##els bo ##hr ' s mature view , quantum mechanical phenomena are required to be experiments , with complete descriptions of all the devices for the system , prep ##arat ##ive , inter ##media ##ry , and finally measuring . [SEP]
[CLS] the descriptions are in macro ##scopic terms , expressed in ordinary language , supplemented with the concepts of classical mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial condition and the final condition of the system are respectively described by values in a configuration space , for example a position space , or some equivalent space such as a momentum space . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum mechanics does not admit a completely precise description , in terms of both position and momentum , of an initial condition or " state " ( in the classical sense of the word ) that would support a precisely deter ##mini ##stic and causal prediction of a final condition . [SEP]
[CLS] in this sense , advocated by bo ##hr in his mature writings , a quantum phenomenon is a process , a passage from initial to final condition , not an instant ##aneous " state " in the classical sense of that word . [SEP]
[CLS] thus there are two kinds of processes in quantum mechanics : stationary and transitional . [SEP]
[CLS] for a stationary process , the initial and final condition are the same . [SEP]
[CLS] for a transition , they are different . [SEP]
[CLS] obviously by definition , if only the initial condition is given , the process is not determined . [SEP]
[CLS] given its initial condition , prediction of its final condition is possible , causal ##ly but only pro ##ba ##bilis ##tically , because the sc ##hr ##od ##inger equation is deter ##mini ##stic for wave function evolution , but the wave function describes the system only pro ##ba ##bilis ##tically . [SEP]
[CLS] for many experiments , it is possible to think of the initial and final conditions of the system as being a particle . [SEP]
[CLS] in some cases it appears that there are potentially several spatial ##ly distinct pathways or tr ##aj ##ect ##ories by which a particle might pass from initial to final condition . [SEP]
[CLS] it is an important feature of the quantum kin ##ema ##tic description that it does not permit a unique definite statement of which of those pathways is actually followed . [SEP]
[CLS] only the initial and final conditions are definite , and , as stated in the fore ##going paragraph , they are defined only as precisely as allowed by the configuration space description or its equivalent . [SEP]
[CLS] in every case for which a quantum kin ##ema ##tic description is needed , there is always a compelling reason for this restriction of kin ##ema ##tic precision . [SEP]
[CLS] an example of such a reason is that for a particle to be experimental ##ly found in a definite position , it must be held motionless ; for it to be experimental ##ly found to have a definite momentum , it must have free motion ; these two are logical ##ly incompatible . [SEP]
[CLS] classical kin ##ema ##tics does not primarily demand experimental description of its phenomena . [SEP]
[CLS] it allows completely precise description of an instant ##aneous state by a value in phase space , the cart ##esian product of configuration and momentum spaces . [SEP]
[CLS] this description simply assumes or imagine ##s a state as a physically existing entity without concern about its experimental me ##as ##ura ##bility . [SEP]
[CLS] such a description of an initial condition , together with newton ' s laws of motion , allows a precise deter ##mini ##stic and causal prediction of a final condition , with a definite trajectory of passage . [SEP]
[CLS] hamilton ##ian dynamics can be used for this . [SEP]
[CLS] classical kin ##ema ##tics also allows the description of a process analogous to the initial and final condition description used by quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] la ##gra ##ng ##ian mechanics applies to this . [SEP]
[CLS] for processes that need account to be taken of actions of a small number of planck constant ##s , classical kin ##ema ##tics is not adequate ; quantum mechanics is needed . [SEP]
[CLS] even with the defining post ##ulates of both einstein ' s theory of general relativity and quantum theory being ind ##is ##put ##ably supported by rigorous and repeated empirical evidence , and while they do not directly contra ##dict each other theoretically ( at least with regard to their primary claims ) , they have proven extremely difficult to incorporate into one consistent , co ##hesive model . [SEP]
[CLS] gravity is ne ##gli ##gible in many areas of particle physics , so that unification between general relativity and quantum mechanics is not an urgent issue in those particular applications . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the lack of a correct theory of quantum gravity is an important issue in physical co ##smo ##logy and the search by physicist ##s for an elegant " theory of everything " ( toe ) . [SEP]
[CLS] consequently , resolving the inc ##ons ##iste ##ncies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th - and 21st - century physics . [SEP]
[CLS] many prominent physicist ##s , including stephen hawk ##ing , have labor ##ed for many years in the attempt to discover a theory underlying " everything " . [SEP]
[CLS] this toe would combine not only the different models of sub ##ato ##mic physics , but also derive the four fundamental forces of nature – the strong force , electro ##ma ##gne ##tism , the weak force , and gravity – from a single force or phenomenon . [SEP]
[CLS] while stephen hawk ##ing was initially a believer in the theory of everything , after considering god ##el ' s incomplete ##ness theorem , he has concluded that one is not obtain ##able , and has stated so publicly in his lecture " god ##el and the end of physics " ( 2002 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the quest to un ##ify the fundamental forces through quantum mechanics is still ongoing . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum electro ##dy ##nami ##cs ( or " quantum electro ##ma ##gne ##tism " ) , which is currently ( in the per ##tur ##bat ##ive regime at least ) the most accurately tested physical theory in competition with general relativity , has been successfully merged with the weak nuclear force into the electro ##we ##ak force and work is currently being done to merge the electro ##we ##ak and strong force into the electro ##st ##rong force . [SEP]
[CLS] current predictions state that at around 10 ge ##v the three aforementioned forces are fused into a single unified field . [SEP]
[CLS] beyond this " grand unification " , it is speculated that it may be possible to merge gravity with the other three gauge sy ##mme ##tries , expected to occur at roughly 10 ge ##v . [SEP]
[CLS] however – and while special relativity is par ##si ##mon ##iously incorporated into quantum electro ##dy ##nami ##cs – the expanded general relativity , currently the best theory describing the gr ##avi ##tation force , has not been fully incorporated into quantum theory . [SEP]
[CLS] one of those searching for a coherent toe is edward wit ##ten , a theoretical physicist who formulated the m - theory , which is an attempt at describing the super ##sy ##mme ##tric ##al based string theory . [SEP]
[CLS] m - theory po ##sit ##s that our apparent 4 - dimensional space ##time is , in reality , actually an 11 - dimensional space ##time containing 10 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension , although 7 of the spatial dimensions are – at lower energies – completely " compact ##ified " ( or infinitely curved ) and not readily am ##ena ##ble to measurement or probing . [SEP]
[CLS] another popular theory is loop quantum gravity ( l ##q ##g ) , a theory first proposed by carlo ro ##vel ##li that describes the quantum properties of gravity . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also a theory of quantum space and quantum time , because in general relativity the geometry of space ##time is a manifestation of gravity . [SEP]
[CLS] l ##q ##g is an attempt to merge and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard general relativity . [SEP]
[CLS] the main output of the theory is a physical picture of space where space is gran ##ular . [SEP]
[CLS] the gran ##ular ##ity is a direct consequence of the quan ##ti ##zation . [SEP]
[CLS] it has the same nature of the gran ##ular ##ity of the photon ##s in the quantum theory of electro ##ma ##gne ##tism or the discrete levels of the energy of the atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] but here it is space itself which is discrete . [SEP]
[CLS] more precisely , space can be viewed as an extremely fine fabric or network " woven " of finite loops . [SEP]
[CLS] these networks of loops are called spin networks . [SEP]
[CLS] the evolution of a spin network over time is called a spin foam . [SEP]
[CLS] the predicted size of this structure is the planck length , which is approximately 1 . 61 ##6 ##× ##10 m . [SEP]
[CLS] according to theory , there is no meaning to length shorter than this ( cf . planck scale energy ) . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , l ##q ##g predict ##s that not just matter , but also space itself , has an atomic structure . [SEP]
[CLS] since its inception , the many counter - intuitive aspects and results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debates and many interpretations . [SEP]
[CLS] even fundamental issues , such as max born ' s basic rules concerning probability amplitude ##s and probability distributions , took decades to be appreciated by society and many leading scientists . [SEP]
[CLS] richard fey ##n ##man once said , " i think i can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics . " [SEP]
[CLS] according to steven wei ##nberg , " there is now in my opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation of quantum mechanics . " [SEP]
[CLS] the copenhagen interpretation – due largely to ni ##els bo ##hr and werner he ##isen ##berg – remains most widely accepted amongst physicist ##s , some 75 years after its en ##unciation . [SEP]
[CLS] according to this interpretation , the pro ##ba ##bilis ##tic nature of quantum mechanics is not a " temporary " feature which will eventually be replaced by a deter ##mini ##stic theory , but instead must be considered a " final " ren ##unciation of the classical idea of " causal ##ity . " [SEP]
[CLS] it is also believed there ##in that any well - defined application of the quantum mechanical formal ##ism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement , due to the con ##ju ##gate nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations . [SEP]
[CLS] albert einstein , himself one of the founders of quantum theory , did not accept some of the more philosophical or metaphysical interpretations of quantum mechanics , such as rejection of deter ##mini ##sm and of causal ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] he is famously quoted as saying , in response to this aspect , " god does not play with dice " . [SEP]
[CLS] he rejected the concept that the state of a physical system depends on the experimental arrangement for its measurement . [SEP]
[CLS] he held that a state of nature occurs in its own right , regardless of whether or how it might be observed . [SEP]
[CLS] in that view , he is supported by the currently accepted definition of a quantum state , which remains invariant under arbitrary choice of configuration space for its representation , that is to say , manner of observation . [SEP]
[CLS] he also held that underlying quantum mechanics there should be a theory that thoroughly and directly expresses the rule against action at a distance ; in other words , he insisted on the principle of locality . [SEP]
[CLS] he considered , but rejected on theoretical grounds , a particular proposal for hidden variables to ob ##via ##te the ind ##eter ##mini ##sm or ac ##aus ##ality of quantum mechanical measurement . [SEP]
[CLS] he considered that quantum mechanics was a currently valid but not a permanently definitive theory for quantum phenomena . [SEP]
[CLS] he thought its future replacement would require profound conceptual advances , and would not come quickly or easily . [SEP]
[CLS] the bo ##hr - einstein debates provide a vibrant critique of the copenhagen interpretation from an ep ##iste ##mo ##logical point of view . [SEP]
[CLS] in arguing for his views , he produced a series of objections , the most famous of which has become known as the einstein – pod ##ols ##ky – rosen paradox . [SEP]
[CLS] john bell showed that this ep ##r paradox led to experimental ##ly test ##able differences between quantum mechanics and theories that rely on added hidden variables . [SEP]
[CLS] experiments have been performed confirming the accuracy of quantum mechanics , thereby demonstrating that quantum mechanics cannot be improved upon by addition of hidden variables . [SEP]
[CLS] alain aspect ' s initial experiments in 1982 , and many subsequent experiments since , have definitive ##ly verified quantum en ##tangle ##ment . [SEP]
[CLS] by the early 1980s , experiments had shown that such in ##e ##qual ##ities were indeed violated in practice – so that there were in fact correlation ##s of the kind suggested by quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] at first these just seemed like isolated es ##oteric effects , but by the mid - 1990s , they were being cod ##ified in the field of quantum information theory , and led to constructions with names like quantum crypt ##ography and quantum tel ##ep ##ort ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] en ##tangle ##ment , as demonstrated in bell - type experiments , does not , however , violate causal ##ity , since no transfer of information happens . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum en ##tangle ##ment forms the basis of quantum crypt ##ography , which is proposed for use in high - security commercial applications in banking and government . [SEP]
[CLS] the everett many - worlds interpretation , formulated in 1956 , holds that " all " the possibilities described by quantum theory " simultaneously " occur in a multi ##verse composed of mostly independent parallel universe ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this is not accomplished by introducing some " new ax ##iom " to quantum mechanics , but on the contrary , by " removing " the ax ##iom of the collapse of the wave packet . [SEP]
[CLS] " all " of the possible consistent states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus ( including the observer ) are present in a " real " physical – not just formally mathematical , as in other interpretations – quantum super ##position . [SEP]
[CLS] such a super ##position of consistent state combinations of different systems is called an en ##tangled state . [SEP]
[CLS] while the multi ##verse is deter ##mini ##stic , we perceive non - deter ##mini ##stic behavior governed by pro ##ba ##bilities , because we can only observe the universe ( i . e . , the consistent state contribution to the aforementioned super ##position ) that we , as observers , inhabit . [SEP]
[CLS] everett ' s interpretation is perfectly consistent with john bell ' s experiments and makes them intuitive ##ly understand ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] however , according to the theory of quantum deco ##her ##ence , these " parallel universe ##s " will never be accessible to us . [SEP]
[CLS] the ina ##cc ##ess ##ibility can be understood as follows : once a measurement is done , the measured system becomes en ##tangled with " both " the physicist who measured it " and " a huge number of other particles , some of which are photon ##s flying away at the speed of light towards the other end of the universe . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to prove that the wave function did not collapse , one would have to bring " all " these particles back and measure them again , together with the system that was originally measured . [SEP]
[CLS] not only is this completely imp ##rac ##tical , but even if one " could " theoretically do this , it would have to destroy any evidence that the original measurement took place ( including the physicist ' s memory ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in light of these bell tests , cramer ( 1986 ) formulated his transaction ##al interpretation which is unique in providing a physical explanation for the born rule . [SEP]
[CLS] relational quantum mechanics appeared in the late 1990s as the modern derivative of the copenhagen interpretation . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum mechanics has had enormous success in explaining many of the features of our universe . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum mechanics is often the only theory that can reveal the individual behaviors of the sub ##ato ##mic particles that make up all forms of matter ( electrons , proton ##s , neutron ##s , photon ##s , and others ) . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum mechanics has strongly influenced string theories , candidates for a theory of everything ( see reduction ##ism ) . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum mechanics is also critically important for understanding how individual atoms are joined by co ##valent bond to form molecules . [SEP]
[CLS] the application of quantum mechanics to chemistry is known as quantum chemistry . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum mechanics can also provide quantitative insight into ionic and co ##valent bonding processes by explicitly showing which molecules are energetic ##ally favorable to which others and the magnitude ##s of the energies involved . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , most of the calculations performed in modern computational chemistry rely on quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] in many aspects modern technology operates at a scale where quantum effects are significant . [SEP]
[CLS] many modern electronic devices are designed using quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] examples include the laser , the trans ##isto ##r ( and thus the micro ##chi ##p ) , the electron microscope , and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the study of semiconductor ##s led to the invention of the di ##ode and the trans ##isto ##r , which are ind ##is ##pen ##sable parts of modern electronics systems , computer and telecommunication devices . [SEP]
[CLS] another application is for making laser di ##ode and light emi ##tting di ##ode which are a high - efficiency source of light . [SEP]
[CLS] many electronic devices operate under effect of quantum tunnel ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] it even exists in the simple light switch . [SEP]
[CLS] the switch would not work if electrons could not quantum tunnel through the layer of oxidation on the metal contact surfaces . [SEP]
[CLS] flash memory chips found in usb drives use quantum tunnel ##ing to erase their memory cells . [SEP]
[CLS] some negative differential resistance devices also utilize quantum tunnel ##ing effect , such as res ##ona ##nt tunnel ##ing di ##ode . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike classical di ##odes , its current is carried by res ##ona ##nt tunnel ##ing through two or more potential barriers ( see right figure ) . [SEP]
[CLS] its negative resistance behavior can only be understood with quantum mechanics : as the confined state moves close to fe ##rmi level , tunnel current increases . [SEP]
[CLS] as it moves away , current decreases . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum mechanics is necessary to understanding and designing such electronic devices . [SEP]
[CLS] researchers are currently seeking robust methods of directly manipulating quantum states . [SEP]
[CLS] efforts are being made to more fully develop quantum crypt ##ography , which will theoretically allow guaranteed secure transmission of information . [SEP]
[CLS] an inherent advantage yielded by quantum crypt ##ography when compared to classical crypt ##ography is the detection of passive ea ##ves ##drop ##ping . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a natural result of the behavior of quantum bits ; due to the observer effect , if a bit in a super ##position state were to be observed , the super ##position state would collapse into an e ##igen ##sta ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] because the intended recipient was expecting to receive the bit in a super ##position state , the intended recipient would know there was an attack , because the bit ' s state would no longer be in a super ##position . [SEP]
[CLS] another goal is the development of quantum computers , which are expected to perform certain computational tasks exponential ##ly faster than classical computers . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of using classical bits , quantum computers use qu ##bit ##s , which can be in super ##position ##s of states . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum programmers are able to manipulate the super ##position of qu ##bit ##s in order to solve problems that classical computing cannot do effectively , such as searching un ##sor ##ted databases or integer factor ##ization . [SEP]
[CLS] ibm claims that the advent of quantum computing may progress the fields of medicine , logistics , financial services , artificial intelligence and cloud security . [SEP]
[CLS] another active research topic is quantum tel ##ep ##ort ##ation , which deals with techniques to transmit quantum information over arbitrary distances . [SEP]
[CLS] while quantum mechanics primarily applies to the smaller atomic regimes of matter and energy , some systems exhibit quantum mechanical effects on a large scale . [SEP]
[CLS] super ##fl ##uid ##ity , the friction ##less flow of a liquid at temperatures near absolute zero , is one well - known example . [SEP]
[CLS] so is the closely related phenomenon of super ##con ##du ##ct ##ivity , the friction ##less flow of an electron gas in a conducting material ( an electric current ) at sufficiently low temperatures . [SEP]
[CLS] the fraction ##al quantum hall effect is a topological ordered state which corresponds to patterns of long - range quantum en ##tangle ##ment . [SEP]
[CLS] states with different topological orders ( or different patterns of long range en ##tangle ##ments ) cannot change into each other without a phase transition . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum theory also provides accurate descriptions for many previously une ##x ##pl ##aine ##d phenomena , such as black - body radiation and the stability of the orbital ##s of electrons in atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] it has also given insight into the workings of many different biological systems , including smell receptors and protein structures . [SEP]
[CLS] recent work on photos ##yn ##thesis has provided evidence that quantum correlation ##s play an essential role in this fundamental process of plants and many other organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] even so , classical physics can often provide good approximation ##s to results otherwise obtained by quantum physics , typically in circumstances with large numbers of particles or large quantum numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] since classical formulas are much simpler and easier to compute than quantum formulas , classical approximation ##s are used and preferred when the system is large enough to render the effects of quantum mechanics insignificant . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , consider a free particle . [SEP]
[CLS] in quantum mechanics , a free matter is described by a wave function . [SEP]
[CLS] the particle properties of the matter become apparent when we measure its position and velocity . [SEP]
[CLS] the wave properties of the matter become apparent when we measure its wave properties like interference . [SEP]
[CLS] the wave – particle dual ##ity feature is incorporated in the relations of coordinates and operators in the formulation of quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] since the matter is free ( not subject to any interactions ) , its quantum state can be represented as a wave of arbitrary shape and extending over space as a wave function . [SEP]
[CLS] the position and momentum of the particle are ob ##ser ##vable ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the uncertainty principle states that both the position and the momentum cannot simultaneously be measured with complete precision . [SEP]
[CLS] however , one " can " measure the position ( alone ) of a moving free particle , creating an e ##igen ##sta ##te of position with a wave function that is very large ( a dir ##ac delta ) at a particular position " x " , and zero everywhere else . [SEP]
[CLS] if one performs a position measurement on such a wave function , the resultant " x " will be obtained with 100 % probability ( i . e . , with full certainty , or complete precision ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this is called an e ##igen ##sta ##te of position – or , stated in mathematical terms , a " generalized position e ##igen ##sta ##te ( e ##igen ##dis ##tri ##bution ) " . [SEP]
[CLS] if the particle is in an e ##igen ##sta ##te of position , then its momentum is completely unknown . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , if the particle is in an e ##igen ##sta ##te of momentum , then its position is completely unknown . [SEP]
[CLS] in an e ##igen ##sta ##te of momentum having a plane wave form , it can be shown that the wavelength is equal to " h / p " , where " h " is planck ' s constant and " p " is the momentum of the e ##igen ##sta ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] the particle in a one - dimensional potential energy box is the most mathematical ##ly simple example where restraints lead to the quan ##ti ##zation of energy levels . [SEP]
[CLS] the box is defined as having zero potential energy everywhere " inside " a certain region , and therefore infinite potential energy everywhere " outside " that region . [SEP]
[CLS] for the one - dimensional case in the formula _ 3 direction , the time - independent sc ##hr ##od ##inger equation may be written [SEP]
[CLS] with the differential operator defined by [SEP]
[CLS] the previous equation is ev ##oca ##tive of the classic kinetic energy analogue , [SEP]
[CLS] with state formula _ 7 in this case having energy formula _ 8 coincide ##nt with the kinetic energy of the particle . [SEP]
[CLS] the general solutions of the sc ##hr ##od ##inger equation for the particle in a box are [SEP]
[CLS] or , from eu ##ler ' s formula , [SEP]
[CLS] the infinite potential walls of the box determine the values of " c " , " d " , and " k " at and where " ψ " must be zero . [SEP]
[CLS] in which " c " cannot be zero as this would conflict with the born interpretation . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , since , " k ##l " must be an integer multiple of π , [SEP]
[CLS] the quan ##ti ##zation of energy levels follows from this constraint on " k " , since [SEP]
[CLS] a finite potential well is the general ##ization of the infinite potential well problem to potential wells having finite depth . [SEP]
[CLS] the finite potential well problem is mathematical ##ly more complicated than the infinite particle - in - a - box problem as the wave function is not pinned to zero at the walls of the well . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , the wave function must satisfy more complicated mathematical boundary conditions as it is non ##zer ##o in regions outside the well . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a model for the quantum tunnel ##ing effect which plays an important role in the performance of modern technologies such as flash memory and scanning tunnel ##ing microscopy . [SEP]
[CLS] quantum tunnel ##ing is central to physical phenomena involved in super ##lat ##tic ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] as in the classical case , the potential for the quantum harmonic os ##ci ##lla ##tor is given by [SEP]
[CLS] this problem can either be treated by directly solving the sc ##hr ##od ##inger equation , which is not trivial , or by using the more elegant " ladder method " first proposed by paul dir ##ac . [SEP]
[CLS] the e ##igen ##sta ##tes are given by [SEP]
[CLS] where " h " are the hermit ##e polynomials [SEP]
[CLS] and the corresponding energy levels are [SEP]
[CLS] this is another example illustrating the quan ##ti ##fication of energy for bound states . [SEP]
[CLS] the solutions are super ##position ##s of left - and right - moving waves : and with coefficients a and b determined from the boundary conditions and by imposing a continuous derivative on the solution , and where the wave vectors are related to the energy via and [SEP]
[CLS] each term of the solution can be interpreted as an incident , reflected , or transmitted component of the wave , allowing the calculation of transmission and reflection coefficients . [SEP]
[CLS] notably , in contrast to classical mechanics , incident particles with energies greater than the potential step are partially reflected . [SEP]
