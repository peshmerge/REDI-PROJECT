[CLS] idiot was formerly a legal and psychiatric category of profound intellectual disability in which a person ' s mental age is two years or less , and he or she cannot guard against common dangers . [SEP]
[CLS] along with terms like mor ##on , im ##be ##ci ##le , and cr ##eti ##n , the term is now archaic and offensive , and was replaced by the term " profound mental re ##tar ##dation " ( which has itself since been replaced by other terms ) . [SEP]
[CLS] nowadays , " idiot " is a der ##oga ##tory term for a stupid or foolish person . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " idiot " comes from the greek , " idiot ##es " ' a private person , individual ' , ' a private citizen ' ( as opposed to an official ) , ' a common man ' , ' a person lacking professional skill , lay ##man ' , later ' un ##ski ##lled ' , ' ignorant ' from , " id ##ios " ' private ' , ' one ' s own ' . [SEP]
[CLS] in latin , " idiot ##a " was borrowed in the meaning ' une ##du ##cated ' , ' ignorant ' , ' common ' , and in late latin came to mean ' crude , ill ##iter ##ate , ignorant ' . [SEP]
[CLS] in french , it kept the meaning of ' ill ##iter ##ate ' , ' ignorant ' , and added the meaning ' stupid ' in the 13th century . [SEP]
[CLS] in english , it added the meaning ' mentally def ##icient ' in the 14th century . [SEP]
[CLS] many political commentators , starting as early as 1856 , have interpreted the word " idiot " as reflecting the ancient greeks ' attitudes to civic participation and private life , combining the ancient meaning of ' private citizen ' with the modern meaning ' fool ' to conclude that the greeks used the word to say that it is selfish and foolish not to participate in public life . [SEP]
[CLS] but this is not how the greeks used the word . [SEP]
[CLS] it is certainly true that the greeks valued civic participation and criticized non - participation . [SEP]
[CLS] th ##uc ##yd ##ides quotes per ##icles ' funeral or ##ation as saying : " we regard . . . him who takes no part in these public duties not as una ##mbit ##ious but as useless " ( τ ##ο ##ν τ ##ε μ ##η ##δ ##ε ##ν τ ##ω ##ν ##δ ##ε μ ##ε ##τ ##ε ##χ ##ο ##ν ##τ ##α ο ##υ ##κ α ##π ##ρ ##α ##γ ##μ ##ο ##ν ##α , α ##λ ##λ α ##χ ##ρ ##ε ##ι ##ο ##ν ν ##ο ##μ ##ι ##ζ ##ο ##μ ##ε ##ν ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , neither he nor any other ancient author uses the word " idiot " to describe non - participants , or in a der ##oga ##tory sense ; its most common use was simply a private citizen or amateur as opposed to a government official , professional , or expert . [SEP]
[CLS] the der ##oga ##tory sense came centuries later , and was unrelated to the political meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] in 19th - and early 20th - century medicine and psychology , an " idiot " was a person with a very profound intellectual disability . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 1900s , dr . henry h . goddard proposed a classification system for intellectual disability based on the bin ##et - simon concept of mental age . [SEP]
[CLS] individuals with the lowest mental age level ( less than three years ) were identified as " idiots " ; " im ##be ##ci ##les " had a mental age of three to seven years , and " mor ##ons " had a mental age of seven to ten years . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " idiot " was used to refer to people having an iq below 30 iq , or intelligence quo ##tie ##nt , was originally determined by dividing a person ' s mental age , as determined by standardized tests , by their actual age . [SEP]
[CLS] the concept of mental age has fallen into di ##sf ##av ##or , though , and iq is now determined on the basis of statistical distributions . [SEP]
[CLS] in the obsolete medical classification ( ic ##d - 9 , 1977 ) , these people were said to have " profound mental re ##tar ##dation " or " profound mental sub ##nor ##mal ##ity " with iq under 20 . [SEP]
[CLS] this term is not in use in the united kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] until 2007 , the california penal code section 26 stated that " idiots " were one of six types of people who are not capable of committing crimes . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2007 the code was amended to read " persons who are mentally inca ##pac ##itated . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 2008 , iowa voters passed a measure replacing " idiot , or insane person " in the state ' s constitution with " person ad ##ju ##dge ##d mentally inc ##omp ##ete ##nt . " [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution of the state of arkansas was amended in the general election of 2008 to , among other things , repeal a provision ( article 3 , section 5 ) which had until its repeal prohibited " idiots or insane persons " from voting . [SEP]
[CLS] a few authors have used " idiot " characters in novels , plays and poetry . [SEP]
[CLS] often these characters are used to highlight or indicate something else ( all ##ego ##ry ) . [SEP]
[CLS] examples of such usage are william faulkner ' s " the sound and the fury " , daphne du ma ##uri ##er ' s " rebecca " and william words ##worth ' s " the idiot boy " . [SEP]
[CLS] idiot characters in literature are often confused with or sub ##sume ##d within mad or lunatic characters . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common intersection between these two categories of mental impairment occurs in the pole ##mic surrounding edmund from william shakespeare ' s " king lear " . [SEP]
[CLS] in f ##yo ##dor dos ##to ##evsky ' s novel " the idiot " the title refers to the central character prince my ##sh ##kin , a man whose innocence , kindness and hum ##ility , combined with his occasional ep ##ile ##ptic symptoms , cause many in the corrupt , ego ##istic culture around him to mistakenly assume that he lacks intelligence . [SEP]
[CLS] in " the anti ##christ " , nietzsche applies the word ' idiot ' to jesus in a comparable fashion , almost certainly in an all ##usion to dos ##to ##evsky ' s use of the word : " one has to regret that no dos ##to ##evsky lived in the neighbourhood of this most interesting " decade ##nt " ; i mean someone who could feel the thrilling fascination of such a combination of the sublime , the sick and the childish . " [SEP]
