Stereochemistry, a subdiscipline of chemistry, involves the study of the relative spatial arrangement of atoms that form the structure of molecules and their manipulation.
The study of stereochemistry focuses on stereoisomers, which by definition have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (constitution), but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space.
An important branch of stereochemistry is the study of chiral molecules.
Stereochemistry includes methods for determining and describing these relationships; the effect on the physical or biological properties these relationships impart upon the molecules in question, and the manner in which these relationships influence the reactivity of the molecules in question (dynamic stereochemistry).
Louis Pasteur could rightly be described as the first stereochemist, having observed in 1842 that salts of tartaric acid collected from wine production vessels could rotate plane polarized light, but that salts from other sources did not.
In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff and Joseph Le Bel explained optical activity in terms of the tetrahedral arrangement of the atoms bound to carbon.Kekulé used tetrahedral models already 1862, but never published these; Emanuele Paternò probably knew these, but was the first to draw and to discuss 1893 three dimensional structures, such as of 1,2-dibromoethane in the "Gazetta Chimica Italiana"
Cahn–Ingold–Prelog priority rules are part of a system for describing a molecule's stereochemistry.
They rank the atoms around a stereocenter in a standard way, allowing the relative position of these atoms in the molecule to be described unambiguously.
In the human body however, thalidomide undergoes racemization: even if only one of the two enantiomers is administered as a drug, the other enantiomer is produced as a result of metabolism.
Accordingly, it is incorrect to state that one stereoisomer is safe while the other is teratogenic.
Thalidomide is currently used for the treatment of other diseases, notably cancer and leprosy.
This disaster was a driving force behind requiring strict testing of drugs before making them available to the public.
