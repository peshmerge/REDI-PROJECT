stereochemistry is the study of how atoms are arranged together in molecules .
stereoisomers have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms atoms atoms atoms atoms atoms atoms atoms atoms atomsghtonly .
an important part of stereochemistry is the study of chiral molecules .
the effect on the physical or biological properties these relationships give molecules in question .
louis pasteur could rightly be described as the first stereochemist .
in 1874 , jacobus henricus van ' t hoff and joseph le bel explained the way atoms bound to carbon .
cahn-ingold-prelog priority rules are part of a system for describing a molecule 's stereochemistry .
they rank the atoms around a stereocenter in a standard way .
in the human body , thalidomide undergoes racemization : even if only one of the two enantiomers is administered as a drug , the other enantiomer is produced as a result of metabolism .
accordingly , it is incorrect to state that one stereoisomer is safe while the other is teratogenic .
thalidomide is now used for the treatment of other diseases , especially cancer and leprosy .
this was a driving force behind requiring strict testing of drugs before making them available to the public .
