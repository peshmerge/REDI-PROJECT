[CLS] stereo ##chemist ##ry , a sub ##dis ##ci ##plin ##e of chemistry , involves the study of the relative spatial arrangement of atoms that form the structure of molecules and their manipulation . [SEP]
[CLS] the study of stereo ##chemist ##ry focuses on stereo ##iso ##mers , which by definition have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms ( constitution ) , but differ in the three - dimensional orientation ##s of their atoms in space . [SEP]
[CLS] for this reason , it is also known as 3d chemistry — the prefix " stereo - " means " three - dimensional ##ity " . [SEP]
[CLS] an important branch of stereo ##chemist ##ry is the study of chi ##ral molecules . [SEP]
[CLS] stereo ##chemist ##ry spans the entire spectrum of organic , inorganic , biological , physical and especially su ##pr ##amo ##le ##cular chemistry . [SEP]
[CLS] stereo ##chemist ##ry includes methods for determining and describing these relationships ; the effect on the physical or biological properties these relationships imp ##art upon the molecules in question , and the manner in which these relationships influence the react ##ivity of the molecules in question ( dynamic stereo ##chemist ##ry ) . [SEP]
[CLS] louis paste ##ur could right ##ly be described as the first stereo ##chemist , having observed in 1842 that salts of tar ##tar ##ic acid collected from wine production vessels could rotate plane polar ##ized light , but that salts from other sources did not . [SEP]
[CLS] this property , the only physical property in which the two types of tar ##tra ##te salts differed , is due to optical iso ##mer ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1874 , jacob ##us henri ##cus van ' t ho ##ff and joseph le bel explained optical activity in terms of the te ##tra ##hedral arrangement of the atoms bound to carbon . ke ##ku ##le used te ##tra ##hedral models already 1862 , but never published these ; emanuel ##e pat ##ern ##o probably knew these , but was the first to draw and to discuss 1893 three dimensional structures , such as of 1 , 2 - di ##bro ##mo ##eth ##ane in the " gaze ##tta chi ##mic ##a italiana " [SEP]
[CLS] ca ##hn – ing ##old – pre ##log priority rules are part of a system for describing a molecule ' s stereo ##chemist ##ry . [SEP]
[CLS] they rank the atoms around a stereo ##cent ##er in a standard way , allowing the relative position of these atoms in the molecule to be described una ##mb ##ig ##uously . [SEP]
[CLS] a fischer projection is a simplified way to depict the stereo ##chemist ##ry around a stereo ##cent ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] an often cited example of the importance of stereo ##chemist ##ry relates to the tha ##lid ##omi ##de disaster . [SEP]
[CLS] tha ##lid ##omi ##de is a pharmaceutical drug , first prepared in 1957 in germany , prescribed for treating morning sickness in pregnant women . [SEP]
[CLS] the drug was discovered to be ter ##ato ##genic , causing serious genetic damage to early embryo ##nic growth and development , leading to limb deformation in babies . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the several proposed mechanisms of ter ##ato ##gen ##ec ##ity involve a different biological function for the ( " r " ) - and the ( " s " ) - tha ##lid ##omi ##de en ##ant ##iom ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] in the human body however , tha ##lid ##omi ##de undergoes race ##mi ##zation : even if only one of the two en ##ant ##iom ##ers is administered as a drug , the other en ##ant ##iom ##er is produced as a result of metabolism . [SEP]
[CLS] accordingly , it is incorrect to state that one stereo ##iso ##mer is safe while the other is ter ##ato ##genic . [SEP]
[CLS] tha ##lid ##omi ##de is currently used for the treatment of other diseases , notably cancer and le ##pro ##sy . [SEP]
[CLS] strict regulations and controls have been enabled to avoid its use by pregnant women and prevent developmental deformation ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this disaster was a driving force behind requiring strict testing of drugs before making them available to the public . [SEP]
[CLS] tor ##sion ##al strain results from resistance to twisting about a bond . [SEP]
