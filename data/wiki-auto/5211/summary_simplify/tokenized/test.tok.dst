[CLS] christianity is an abraham ##ic mono ##the ##istic religion based on the life and teachings of jesus of nazareth . [SEP]
[CLS] its adherents , known as christians , believe that jesus is the christ , the son of god , and the savior of all people , whose coming as the messiah was prop ##hes ##ied in the hebrew bible , called the old testament in christianity , and chronicle ##d in the new testament . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity began as a second temple ju ##dai ##c sect in the 1st century in the roman province of jude ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] it soon attracted gen ##tile god - fear ##ers , which led to a departure from jewish customs , and , after the fall of jerusalem , ad 70 which ended the temple - based judaism , christianity as a religion began . [SEP]
[CLS] emperor constantine the great converted to christianity ( 312 ) and dec ##rim ##inal ##ized it in the roman empire by the edict of milan ( 313 ) , later con ##ven ##ing the council of nic ##aea ( 325 ) where early christianity was consolidated into what would become the state church of the roman empire ( 380 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , protestant ##ism split in numerous denominations from the catholic church in the reformation ( 16th century ) over theological and ec ##cles ##iol ##ogical disputes , most predominantly on the issue of justification and the prima ##cy of the bishop of rome . [SEP]
[CLS] following the age of discovery ( 15th – 17th century ) , christianity was spread into the americas , oceania , sub - saharan africa , and the rest of the world via missionary work . [SEP]
[CLS] their creed ##s generally hold in common jesus as the son of god — the logos inca ##rna ##ted — who mini ##st ##red , suffered , and died on a cross , but rose from the dead for the salvation of mankind ; as referred to as the gospel , meaning the " good news " , in the bible ( scripture ) . [SEP]
[CLS] describing jesus ' life and teachings are the four canonical gospels of matthew , mark , luke and john with the jewish old testament as the gospel ' s respected background . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity and christian ethics played a prominent role in the development of western civilization , particularly around europe from late antiquity and the middle ages . [SEP]
[CLS] despite a decline in adherence in the west , christianity remains the dominant religion in the region , with about 70 % of the population identifying as christian . [SEP]
[CLS] according to , the term " christian " was first used in reference to jesus ' s disciples in the city of antioch , meaning " followers of christ , " by the non - jewish inhabitants of antioch . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest recorded use of the term " christianity " was by ignatius of antioch , in around 100 ad . [SEP]
[CLS] while christians worldwide share basic convictions , there are also differences of interpretations and opinions of the bible and sacred traditions on which christianity is based . [SEP]
[CLS] they began as baptism ##al formula ##e and were later expanded during the christ ##ological controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries to become statements of faith . [SEP]
[CLS] its central doctrines are those of the trinity and god the creator . [SEP]
[CLS] each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the apostolic period . [SEP]
[CLS] the creed was apparently used as a summary of christian doctrine for baptism ##al candidates in the churches of rome . [SEP]
[CLS] the nice ##ne creed was formulated , largely in response to aria ##nism , at the councils of nic ##aea and constantinople in 325 and 381 respectively , and ratified as the universal creed of christ ##end ##om by the first council of ep ##hes ##us in 43 ##1 . [SEP]
[CLS] the cha ##lce ##don ##ian definition , or creed of cha ##lce ##don , developed at the council of cha ##lce ##don in 451 , though rejected by the oriental orthodox , taught christ " to be acknowledged in two nature ##s , inc ##on ##fus ##edly , un ##chang ##ea ##bly , ind ##iv ##isi ##bly , ins ##ep ##ara ##bly " : one divine and one human , and that both nature ##s , while perfect in themselves , are nevertheless also perfectly united into one person . [SEP]
[CLS] the at ##hana ##sian creed , received in the western church as having the same status as the nice ##ne and cha ##lce ##don ##ian , says : " we worship one god in trinity , and trinity in unity ; neither con ##fo ##und ##ing the persons nor dividing the substance . " [SEP]
[CLS] most christians ( catholic , eastern orthodox , oriental orthodox , and protestant alike ) accept the use of creed ##s , and sub ##scribe to at least one of the creed ##s mentioned above . [SEP]
[CLS] the central ten ##et of christianity is the belief in jesus as the son of god and the messiah ( christ ) . [SEP]
[CLS] christians believe that jesus , as the messiah , was an ##oint ##ed by god as savior of humanity and hold that jesus ' coming was the fulfillment of mess ##iani ##c prop ##he ##cies of the old testament . [SEP]
[CLS] the core christian belief is that through belief in and acceptance of the death and resurrection of jesus , sin ##ful humans can be reconciled to god , and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life . [SEP]
[CLS] while there have been many theological disputes over the nature of jesus over the earliest centuries of christian history , generally , christians believe that jesus is god inca ##rna ##te and " true god and true man " ( or both fully divine and fully human ) . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the new testament , he rose from the dead , ascended to heaven , is seated at the right hand of the father , and will ultimately return to fulfill the rest of the mess ##iani ##c prophecy , including the resurrection of the dead , the last judgment , and the final establishment of the kingdom of god . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the canonical gospels of matthew and luke , jesus was conceived by the holy spirit and born from the virgin mary . [SEP]
[CLS] in comparison , his adulthood , especially the week before his death , is well documented in the gospels contained within the new testament , because that part of his life is believed to be most important . [SEP]
[CLS] christians consider the resurrection of jesus to be the cornerstone of their faith ( see 1 co ##rin ##thi ##ans 15 ) and the most important event in history . [SEP]
[CLS] among christian beliefs , the death and resurrection of jesus are two core events on which much of christian doctrine and theology is based . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the new testament , jesus was cr ##uc ##ified , died a physical death , was buried within a tomb , and rose from the dead three days later . [SEP]
[CLS] the new testament mentions several resurrection appearances of jesus on different occasions to his twelve apostles and disciples , including " more than five hundred brethren at once " , before jesus ' ascension to heaven . [SEP]
[CLS] jesus ' death and resurrection are commemorated by christians in all worship services , with special emphasis during holy week , which includes good friday and easter sunday . [SEP]
[CLS] the death and resurrection of jesus are usually considered the most important events in christian theology , partly because they demonstrate that jesus has power over life and death and therefore has the authority and power to give people eternal life . [SEP]
[CLS] some modern scholars use the belief of jesus ' followers in the resurrection as a point of departure for establishing the continuity of the historical jesus and the proclamation of the early church . [SEP]
[CLS] paul the apostle , an early christian convert and missionary , wrote , " if christ was not raised , then all our preaching is useless , and your trust in god is useless . " [SEP]
[CLS] paul the apostle , like jews and roman pagan ##s of his time , believed that sacrifice can bring about new kinship ties , purity , and eternal life . [SEP]
[CLS] for paul , the necessary sacrifice was the death of jesus : gen ##tile ##s who are " christ ' s " are , like israel , descendants of abraham and " heirs according to the promise " . [SEP]
[CLS] modern christian churches tend to be much more concerned with how humanity can be saved from a universal condition of sin and death than the question of how both jews and gen ##tile ##s can be in god ' s family . [SEP]
[CLS] according to eastern orthodox theology , based upon their understanding of the at ##one ##ment as put forward by ir ##ena ##eus ' rec ##ap ##it ##ulation theory , jesus ' death is a ransom . [SEP]
[CLS] martin luther taught that baptism was necessary for salvation , but modern lutheran ##s and other protestants tend to teach that salvation is a gift that comes to an individual by god ' s grace , sometimes defined as " un ##mer ##ited favor " , even apart from baptism . [SEP]
[CLS] christians differ in their views on the extent to which individuals ' salvation is pre - ordained by god . [SEP]
[CLS] reformed theology places distinctive emphasis on grace by teaching that individuals are completely incapable of self - redemption , but that san ##ct ##ifying grace is irresistible . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast catholics , orthodox christians , and arm ##inian protestants believe that the exercise of free will is necessary to have faith in jesus . [SEP]
[CLS] in the words of the at ##hana ##sian creed , an early statement of christian belief , " the father is god , the son is god , and the holy spirit is god , and yet there are not three gods but one god " . [SEP]
[CLS] though distinct , the three persons cannot be divided from one another in being or in operation . [SEP]
[CLS] while some christians also believe that god appeared as the father in the old testament , it is agreed that he appeared as the son in the new testament , and will still continue to manifest as the holy spirit in the present . [SEP]
[CLS] however , traditionally there is a belief that it was the son who appeared in the old testament because , for example , when the trinity is depicted in art , the son typically has the distinctive appearance , a cr ##uc ##iform halo identifying christ , and in depictions of the garden of eden , this looks forward to an incarnation yet to occur . [SEP]
[CLS] in some early christian sar ##co ##pha ##gi the logos is distinguished with a beard , " which allows him to appear ancient , even pre - existent . " [SEP]
[CLS] from earlier than the times of the nice ##ne creed ( 325 ) christianity advocated the tri ##une mystery - nature of god as a norma ##tive profession of faith . [SEP]
[CLS] according to this doctrine , god is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole ; rather , each person is considered to be fully god ( see per ##ich ##ores ##is ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the distinction lies in their relations , the father being un ##be ##go ##tten ; the son being beg ##otte ##n of the father ; and the holy spirit proceeding from the father and ( in western christian theology ) from the son . [SEP]
[CLS] the term may have been in use before this time ; its latin equivalent , " tri ##ni ##tas " , appears afterwards with an explicit reference to the father , the son , and the holy spirit , in ter ##tu ##lli ##an . [SEP]
[CLS] although the words " trinity " and " tri ##une " do not appear in the bible , theologians , beginning in the 3rd century , developed the term and concept to facilitate comprehension of the new testament teachings of god as being father , son , and holy spirit . [SEP]
[CLS] since that time , christian theologians have been careful to emphasize that trinity does not imply that there are three gods ( the anti ##tri ##ni ##tarian heresy of tri ##the ##ism ) , nor that each h ##yp ##osta ##sis of the trinity is one - third of an infinite god ( partial ##ism ) , nor that the son and the holy spirit are beings created by and subordinate to the father ( aria ##nism ) . [SEP]
[CLS] various non ##tri ##ni ##tarian views , such as adoption ##ism or mod ##alis ##m , existed in early christianity , leading to the disputes about christ ##ology . [SEP]
[CLS] non ##tri ##ni ##tarian ##ism later appeared again in the g ##nostic ##ism of the cat ##har ##s between the 11th and 13th centuries , among groups with unitarian theology in the protestant reformation of the 16th century , in the 18th - century enlightenment , and in some groups arising during the second great awakening of the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] the major issues in christian es ##cha ##tology are the tri ##bula ##tion , death and the afterlife , the rap ##ture , the second coming of jesus , resurrection of the dead , heaven and hell , millennia ##lism , the last judgment , the end of the world , and the new heavens and new earth . [SEP]
[CLS] christians believe that the second coming of christ will occur at the end of time , after a period of severe persecution ( the great tri ##bula ##tion ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this includes the general judgement at the resurrection of the dead as well as the belief ( held by catholics , orthodox and most protestants ) in a judgment particular to the individual soul upon physical death . [SEP]
[CLS] in catholicism , those who die in a state of grace , i . e . , without any mortal sin separating them from god , but are still imperfect ##ly pu ##rified from the effects of sin , undergo purification through the intermediate state of pu ##rga ##tory to achieve the holiness necessary for entrance into god ' s presence . [SEP]
[CLS] some christian groups , such as seventh - day adventist ##s , hold to mortal ##ism , the belief that the human soul is not naturally immortal , and is unconscious during the intermediate state between bodily death and resurrection . [SEP]
[CLS] these christians also hold to ann ##ih ##ilation ##ism , the belief that subsequent to the final judgement , the wicked will cease to exist rather than suffer ever ##las ##ting torment . [SEP]
[CLS] depending on the specific denomination of christianity , practices may include baptism , eu ##cha ##rist ( holy communion or the lord ' s supper ) , prayer ( including the lord ' s prayer ) , confession , confirmation , burial rites , marriage rites and the religious education of children . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , as justin described , christians assemble for communal worship on sunday , the day of the resurrection , though other liturgical practices often occur outside this setting . [SEP]
[CLS] scripture readings are drawn from the old and new testament ##s , but especially the gospel accounts . [SEP]
[CLS] instruction is given based on these readings , called a sermon , or ho ##mi ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] a division is often made between " high " church services , characterized by greater solemn ##ity and ritual , and " low " services , but even within these two categories , there is great diversity in forms of worship . [SEP]
[CLS] charismatic or pen ##tec ##ostal congregations may spontaneously feel led by the holy spirit to action rather than follow a formal order of service , including spontaneous prayer . [SEP]
[CLS] some churches use only a cappella music , either on principle ( for example , many churches of christ object to the use of instruments in worship ) or by tradition ( as in orthodoxy ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it is re ##ena ##cted in accordance with jesus ' instruction at the last supper that his followers do in remembrance of him as when he gave his disciples bread , saying , " this is my body " , and gave them wine saying , " this is my blood " . [SEP]
[CLS] they offer communion to those who are already united in that denomination or sometimes individual church . [SEP]
[CLS] most other churches practice open communion since they view communion as a means to unity , rather than an end , and invite all believing christians to participate . [SEP]
[CLS] worship can be varied for special events like baptism ##s or weddings in the service or significant feast days . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early church , christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the eu ##cha ##rist ##ic part of the worship . [SEP]
[CLS] in many churches today , adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age - appropriate teaching . [SEP]
[CLS] such children ' s worship is often called sunday school or sabbath school ( sunday schools are often held before rather than during services ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the two most widely accepted sacrament ##s are baptism and the eu ##cha ##rist ( or holy communion ) , however , the majority of christians also recognize five additional sacrament ##s : confirmation ( chris ##mation in the orthodox tradition ) , holy orders ( ordination ) , pena ##nce ( or confession ) , an ##oint ##ing of the sick , and mat ##rim ##ony ( see christian views on marriage ) . [SEP]
[CLS] most other denominations and traditions typically af ##firm only baptism and eu ##cha ##rist as sacrament ##s , while some protestant groups , such as the quakers , reject sacrament ##al theology . [SEP]
[CLS] christian denominations , such as baptist ##s , which believe these rites do not communicate grace , prefer to call baptism and holy communion " ordinance ##s " rather than sacrament ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of seasons , each with their theological em ##pha ##ses , and modes of prayer , which can be sign ##ified by different ways of decor ##ating churches , colours of para ##ments and vest ##ments for clergy , script ##ural readings , themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home . [SEP]
[CLS] western christian liturgical calendar ##s are based on the cycle of the roman rite of the catholic church , and eastern christians use analogous calendar ##s based on the cycle of their respective rites . [SEP]
[CLS] calendar ##s set aside holy days , such as solemn ##ities which commemorate an event in the life of jesus , mary , or the saints , and periods of fast ##ing , such as lent and other pious events such as memo ##ria , or lesser festivals commemorating saints . [SEP]
[CLS] christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations , such as christmas , easter , and pen ##tec ##ost : these are the celebrations of christ ' s birth , resurrection , and the descent of the holy spirit upon the church , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity has not generally practiced an ##icon ##ism , the avoidance or prohibition of devotion ##al images , even if early jewish christians and some modern denominations , in ##voking the dec ##alo ##gue ' s prohibition of idol ##at ##ry , avoided figures in their symbols . [SEP]
[CLS] the cross , today one of the most widely recognized symbols , was used by christians from the earliest times . [SEP]
[CLS] ter ##tu ##lli ##an , in his book " de corona " , tells how it was already a tradition for christians to trace the sign of the cross on their forehead ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] although the cross was known to the early christians , the cr ##uc ##if ##ix did not appear in use until the 5th century . [SEP]
[CLS] among the earliest christian symbols , that of the fish or ich ##thy ##s seems to have ranked first in importance , as seen on monumental sources such as tombs from the first decades of the 2nd century . [SEP]
[CLS] some , such as the catholic and eastern orthodox churches , as well as lutheran ##s and anglican ##s , hold to the doctrine of baptism ##al regeneration , which af ##firm ##s that baptism creates or strengthen ##s a person ' s faith , and is intimately linked to salvation . [SEP]
[CLS] others view baptism as a purely symbolic act , an external public declaration of the inward change which has taken place in the person , but not as spiritual ##ly e ##ffi ##ca ##cious . [SEP]
[CLS] those who hold the first view may also adhere to the tradition of infant baptism ; the orthodox churches all practice infant baptism and always ba ##pt ##ize by total immersion repeated three times in the name of the father , the son , and the holy spirit . [SEP]
[CLS] jesus ' teaching on prayer in the sermon on the mount displays a distinct lack of interest in the external aspects of prayer . [SEP]
[CLS] a concern with the techniques of prayer is condemned as " pagan " , and instead a simple trust in god ' s father ##ly goodness is encouraged . [SEP]
[CLS] this confident position should be understood in light of christian belief in the unique relationship between the believer and christ through the ind ##well ##ing of the holy spirit . [SEP]
[CLS] in subsequent christian traditions , certain physical gestures are emphasized , including medieval gestures such as gen ##uf ##le ##ction or making the sign of the cross . [SEP]
[CLS] frequently in western christianity , the hands are placed palms together and forward as in the feudal commendation ceremony . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many inter ##ces ##sor ##y prayers recorded in the bible , including prayers of the apostle peter on behalf of sick persons and by prophets of the old testament in favor of other people . [SEP]
[CLS] the ancient church , in both eastern and western christianity , developed a tradition of asking for the inter ##ces ##sion of ( deceased ) saints , and this remains the practice of most eastern orthodox , oriental orthodox , catholic , and some anglican churches . [SEP]
[CLS] the reformer hu ##ld ##ry ##ch z ##wing ##li admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the bible convinced him that this was idol ##at ##rous . [SEP]
[CLS] the book of common prayer in the anglican tradition is a guide which provides a set order for church services , containing set prayers , scripture readings , and hymns or sung psalms . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity regards the biblical canon , the old testament and the new testament , as the inspired word of god . [SEP]
[CLS] others claim in ##er ##ran ##cy for the bible in its original manuscripts , although none of those are extant . [SEP]
[CLS] another closely related view is biblical in ##fall ##ibility or limited in ##er ##ran ##cy , which af ##firm ##s that the bible is free of error as a guide to salvation , but may include errors on matters such as history , geography , or science . [SEP]
[CLS] these variations are a reflection of the range of traditions , and of the councils that have convened on the subject . [SEP]
[CLS] however , they are considered to be important historical documents which help to inform the understanding of words , grammar , and syntax used in the historical period of their conception . [SEP]
[CLS] the new testament , originally written in ko ##ine greek , contains 27 books which are agreed upon by all churches . [SEP]
[CLS] while the king james version is held to by many because of its striking english prose , in fact it was translated from the erasmus greek bible , which in turn " was based on a single 12th century manuscript that is one of the worst manuscripts we have available to us " . [SEP]
[CLS] much scholarship in the past several hundred years has gone into comparing different manuscripts in order to rec ##ons ##truct the original text . [SEP]
[CLS] other gospels have now been recovered , such as those found near na ##g ham ##mad ##i in 1945 , and while some of these texts are quite different from what christians have been used to , it should be understood that some of this newly recovered gospel material is quite possibly con ##tem ##por ##aneous with , or even earlier than , the new testament gospels . [SEP]
[CLS] the core of the gospel of thomas , in particular , may date from as early as ad 50 ( although some major scholars contest this early dating ) , and if so would provide an insight into the earliest gospel texts that under ##lie the canonical gospels , texts that are mentioned in luke 1 : 1 – 2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the gospel of thomas contains much that is familiar from the canonical gospels — verse 113 , for example ( " the father ' s kingdom is spread out upon the earth , but people do not see it " ) , is reminiscent of luke 17 : 20 – 21 — and the gospel of john , with a terminology and approach that is suggest ##ive of what was later termed " g ##nostic ##ism " , has recently been seen as a possible response to the gospel of thomas , a text that is commonly labelled " proto - g ##nostic " . [SEP]
[CLS] scholarship , then , is currently exploring the relationship in the early church between mystical speculation and experience on the one hand and the search for church order on the other , by analyzing new - found texts , by subject ##ing canonical texts to further scrutiny , and by an examination of the passage of new testament texts to canonical status . [SEP]
[CLS] the " literal " sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of scripture . [SEP]
[CLS] protestant christians believe that the bible is a self - sufficient revelation , the final authority on all christian doctrine , and revealed all truth necessary for salvation . [SEP]
[CLS] related to this is " efficacy " , that scripture is able to lead people to faith ; and " su ##ffi ##ciency " , that the scriptures contain everything that one needs to know in order to obtain salvation and to live a christian life . [SEP]
[CLS] protestants stress the meaning conveyed by the words of scripture , the historical - grammatical method . [SEP]
[CLS] the historical - grammatical method or gram ##matic ##o - historical method is an effort in biblical her ##men ##eu ##tics to find the intended original meaning in the text . [SEP]
[CLS] this original intended meaning of the text is drawn out through examination of the passage in light of the grammatical and syn ##ta ##ctic ##al aspects , the historical background , the literary genre , as well as theological ( canonical ) considerations . [SEP]
[CLS] the moment we neglect this principle we drift out upon a sea of uncertainty and conjecture . " [SEP]
[CLS] technically speaking , the grammatical - historical method of interpretation is distinct from the determination of the passage ' s significance in light of that interpretation . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity developed during the 1st century ce as a jewish christian sect of second temple judaism . [SEP]
[CLS] an early jewish christian community was founded in jerusalem under the leadership of the pillars of the church , namely james the just , the brother of the lord , saint peter , and john . [SEP]
[CLS] they had known jesus , and , according to paul , the arise ##n christ had first appeared to james and peter . [SEP]
[CLS] jewish christianity soon attracted gen ##tile god - fear ##ers , posing a problem for its jewish religious outlook , which insisted on close ob ##ser ##vance of the jewish commands . [SEP]
[CLS] at first he persecuted the early christians , but after a conversion experience he preached to the gen ##tile ##s , and is regarded as having had a format ##ive effect on the emerging christian identity as separate from judaism . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , his departure from jewish customs would result in the establishment of christianity as an independent religion . [SEP]
[CLS] from the year 150 , christian teachers began to produce theological and apologetic works aimed at defending the faith . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the new testament , christians were from the beginning , subject to persecution by some jewish and roman religious authorities . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity spread to aramaic - speaking peoples along the mediterranean coast and also to the inland parts of the roman empire and beyond that into the part ##hian empire and the later sas ##anian empire , including mesopotamia , which was dominated at different times and to varying extent ##s by these empires . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence of christianity in africa began in the middle of the 1st century in egypt and by the end of the 2nd century in the region around carthage . [SEP]
[CLS] it was not an entirely new religion in armenia , having penetrated into the country from at least the third century , but it may have been present even earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] under emperor constantine , state - sanctioned persecution of early christians ended with the edict of to ##ler ##ation in 311 and the edict of milan in 313 . [SEP]
[CLS] on 27 february 380 , theo ##dos ##ius i , gr ##ati ##an , and valentin ##ian ii established nice ##ne christianity as the state church of the roman empire . [SEP]
[CLS] in terms of prosperity and cultural life , the byzantine empire was one of the peaks in christian history and christian civilization , and constantinople remained the leading city of the christian world in size , wealth , and culture . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a renewed interest in classical greek philosophy , as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular greek . [SEP]
[CLS] byzantine art and literature held a pre ##emi ##nent place in europe , and the cultural impact of byzantine art on the west during this period was enormous and of long - lasting significance . [SEP]
[CLS] the later rise of islam in north africa reduced the size and numbers of christian congregations , leaving in large numbers only the coptic church in egypt , the ethiopian orthodox te ##wa ##hed ##o church in the horn of africa and the nu ##bian church in the sudan ( no ##bat ##ia , ma ##kur ##ia and al ##od ##ia ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the church also entered into a long period of missionary activity and expansion among the various tribes . [SEP]
[CLS] while aria ##nist ##s instituted the death penalty for practicing pagan ##s ( see the massacre of verde ##n , for example ) , what would later become catholicism also spread among the hungarians , the germanic , the celtic , the baltic and some slavic peoples . [SEP]
[CLS] monastic ##ism became a powerful force throughout europe , and gave rise to many early centers of learning , most famously in ireland , scotland , and gaul , contributing to the carol ##ing ##ian renaissance of the 9th century . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 7th century , muslims conquered syria ( including jerusalem ) , north africa , and spain , converting some of the christian population to islam , and placing the rest under a separate legal status . [SEP]
[CLS] part of the muslims ' success was due to the exhaustion of the byzantine empire in its decades long conflict with persia . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning in the 8th century , with the rise of carol ##ing ##ian leaders , the papacy sought greater political support in the frankish kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 8th century , icon ##oc ##las ##m became a di ##vis ##ive issue , when it was sponsored by the byzantine emperors . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 10th century , western christian monastic ##ism was further re ##ju ##ven ##ated through the leadership of the great benedictine monastery of cl ##un ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] in the west , from the 11th century onward , some older cathedral schools became universities ( see , for example , university of oxford , university of paris and university of bologna ) . [SEP]
[CLS] previously , higher education had been the domain of christian cathedral schools or monastic schools ( " sc ##hol ##ae monastic ##ae " ) , led by monks and nuns . [SEP]
[CLS] the university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the medieval christian setting . [SEP]
[CLS] accompanying the rise of the " new towns " throughout europe , men ##dic ##ant orders were founded , bringing the consecrated religious life out of the monastery and into the new urban setting . [SEP]
[CLS] in this period , church building and ecclesiastical architecture reached new heights , culminating in the orders of romanesque and gothic architecture and the building of the great european cathedral ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] these were a series of military campaigns in the holy land and elsewhere , initiated in response to pleas from the byzantine emperor alex ##ios i for aid against turkish expansion . [SEP]
[CLS] the crusade ##s ultimately failed to st ##if ##le islamic aggression and even contributed to christian en ##mity with the sack ##ing of constantinople during the fourth crusade . [SEP]
[CLS] the christian church experienced internal conflict between the 7th and 13th centuries that resulted in a sc ##hism between the so - called latin or western christian branch ( the catholic church ) , and an eastern , largely greek , branch ( the eastern orthodox church ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the second council of lyon ( 127 ##4 ) and the council of florence ( 143 ##9 ) attempted to reunite the churches , but in both cases , the eastern orthodox refused to implement the decisions , and the two principal churches remain in sc ##hism to the present day . [SEP]
[CLS] in the thirteenth century , a new emphasis on jesus ' suffering , exemplified by the franciscan ##s ' preaching , had the consequence of turning worship ##pers ' attention towards jews , on whom christians had placed the blame for jesus ' death . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity ' s limited tolerance of jews was not new — augustine of hip ##po said that jews should not be allowed to enjoy the citizenship that christians took for granted — but the growing anti ##pathy towards jews was a factor that led to the expulsion of jews from england in 129 ##0 , the first of many such expulsion ##s in europe . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning around 118 ##4 , following the crusade against cat ##har heresy , various institutions , broadly referred to as the inquisition , were established with the aim of suppress ##ing heresy and securing religious and doc ##tri ##nal unity within christianity through conversion and prosecution .

[CLS] in 152 ##1 the edict of worms condemned and ex ##com ##mun ##icated luther and his followers , resulting in the sc ##hism of the western christ ##end ##om into several branches . [SEP]
[CLS] the reformation in england began in 153 ##4 , when king henry viii had himself declared head of the church of england . [SEP]
[CLS] thomas mu ##nt ##zer , andreas karl ##stadt and other theologians perceived both the catholic church and the confessions of the mag ##ister ##ial reformation as corrupted . [SEP]
[CLS] partly in response to the protestant reformation , the catholic church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal , known as the counter - reformation or catholic reform . [SEP]
[CLS] partly from missionary ze ##al , but under the impetus of colonial expansion by the european powers , christianity spread to the americas , oceania , east asia and sub - saharan africa . [SEP]

[CLS] in the era known as the great diver ##gence , when in the west , the age of enlightenment and the scientific revolution brought about great societal changes , christianity was confronted with various forms of skepticism and with certain modern political id ##eo ##logies , such as versions of socialism and liberalism . [SEP]
[CLS] events ranged from mere anti - clerical ##ism to violent outburst ##s against christianity , such as the dec ##hri ##sti ##ani ##zation of france during the french revolution , the spanish civil war , and certain marxist movements , especially the russian revolution and the persecution of christians in the soviet union under state at ##hei ##sm . [SEP]
[CLS] especially pressing in europe was the formation of nation states after the napoleonic era . [SEP]
[CLS] in all european countries , different christian denominations found themselves in competition to greater or lesser extent ##s with each other and with the state . [SEP]
[CLS] variables were the relative sizes of the denominations and the religious , political , and ideological orientation of the states . [SEP]
[CLS] competition is found in germany , the netherlands , and again switzerland , all countries with minority catholic populations , which to a greater or lesser extent identified with the nation . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , separation between religion ( again , specifically catholicism ) and the state is found to a great degree in france and italy , countries where the state actively opposed itself to the authority of the catholic church . [SEP]
[CLS] the combined factors of the formation of nation states and ultra ##mont ##ani ##sm , especially in germany and the netherlands , but also in england to a much lesser extent , often forced catholic churches , organizations , and believers to choose between the national demands of the state and the authority of the church , specifically the papacy . [SEP]
[CLS] this conflict came to a head in the first vatican council , and in germany would lead directly to the " ku ##lt ##ur ##kam ##pf " , where liberals and protestants under the leadership of bismarck managed to severely restrict catholic expression and organization . [SEP]
[CLS] christian commitment in europe dropped as modern ##ity and secular ##ism came into their own , particularly in the czech republic and estonia , while religious commitments in america have been generally high in comparison to europe . [SEP]
[CLS] with around 2 . 4 billion adherents , split into three main branches of catholic , protestant , and eastern orthodox , christianity is the world ' s largest religion . [SEP]
[CLS] this masks a major shift in the demographics of christianity ; large increases in the developing world have been accompanied by substantial declines in the developed world , mainly in europe and north america . [SEP]
[CLS] according to a 2015 pew research center study , within the next four decades , christians will remain the world ' s largest religion ; and by 205 ##0 , the christian population is expected to exceed 3 billion . [SEP]
[CLS] as a percentage of christians , the catholic church and orthodoxy ( both eastern and oriental ) are declining in parts of the world ( though catholicism is growing in asia , in africa , vibrant in eastern europe , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] ) , while protestants and other christians are on the rise in the developing world . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity is the predominant religion in europe , the americas , and southern africa . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it is declining in many areas including the northern and western united states , oceania ( australia and new zealand ) , northern europe ( including great britain , scandinavia and other places ) , france , germany , and the canadian provinces of ontario , british columbia , and quebec , and parts of asia ( especially the middle east , due to the christian emigration , south korea , taiwan , and macau ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the christian population is not decreasing in brazil , the southern united states , and the province of alberta , canada , but the percentage is decreasing . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the declining numbers , christianity remains the dominant religion in the western world , where 70 % are christians . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2011 pew research center survey found that 76 % of europeans , 73 % in oceania and about 86 % in the americas ( 90 % in latin america and 77 % in north america ) identified themselves as christians . [SEP]
[CLS] in most countries in the developed world , church attendance among people who continue to identify themselves as christians has been falling over the last few decades . [SEP]
[CLS] some sources view this simply as part of a drift away from traditional membership institutions , while others link it to signs of a decline in belief in the importance of religion in general . [SEP]
[CLS] according to data from the 2012 european social survey , around a third of european christians say they attend services once a month or more , conversely about more than two - thirds of latin american christians ; according to the world values survey , about 90 % of african christians ( in ghana , nigeria , r ##wan ##d ] , south africa and zimbabwe ) said they attended church regularly . [SEP]
[CLS] there are numerous other countries , such as cyprus , which although do not have an established church , still give official recognition and support to a specific christian denomination . [SEP]
