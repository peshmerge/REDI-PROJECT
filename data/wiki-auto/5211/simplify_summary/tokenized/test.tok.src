[CLS] christianity is an abraham ##ic mono ##the ##istic religion based on the life and teachings of jesus of nazareth . [SEP]
[CLS] its adherents , known as christians , believe that jesus is the christ , the son of god , and the savior of all people , whose coming as the messiah was prop ##hes ##ied in the hebrew bible , called the old testament in christianity , and chronicle ##d in the new testament . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the world ' s largest religion with about 2 . 4 billion followers . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity began as a second temple ju ##dai ##c sect in the 1st century in the roman province of jude ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] jesus ' apostles and their followers spread around syria , the levant , europe , anatolia , mesopotamia , trans ##ca ##uca ##sia , egypt , and ethiopia , despite initial persecution . [SEP]
[CLS] it soon attracted gen ##tile god - fear ##ers , which led to a departure from jewish customs , and , after the fall of jerusalem , ad 70 which ended the temple - based judaism , christianity as a religion began . [SEP]
[CLS] emperor constantine the great converted to christianity ( 312 ) and dec ##rim ##inal ##ized it in the roman empire by the edict of milan ( 313 ) , later con ##ven ##ing the council of nic ##aea ( 325 ) where early christianity was consolidated into what would become the state church of the roman empire ( 380 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the early history of christianity ' s united church before major sc ##hism ##s is sometimes referred to as the " great church " . [SEP]
[CLS] the church of the east split after the council of ep ##hes ##us ( 43 ##1 ) and oriental orthodoxy split after the council of cha ##lce ##don ( 451 ) over differences in christ ##ology , while the eastern orthodox church and the catholic church separated in the east – west sc ##hism ( 105 ##4 ) , especially over the authority of the bishop of rome . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , protestant ##ism split in numerous denominations from the catholic church in the reformation ( 16th century ) over theological and ec ##cles ##iol ##ogical disputes , most predominantly on the issue of justification and the prima ##cy of the bishop of rome . [SEP]
[CLS] following the age of discovery ( 15th – 17th century ) , christianity was spread into the americas , oceania , sub - saharan africa , and the rest of the world via missionary work . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity remains culturally diverse in its western and eastern branches , as well as in its doctrines concerning justification and the nature of salvation , ec ##cles ##iology , ordination , and christ ##ology . [SEP]
[CLS] the four largest branches of christianity are the catholic church ( 1 . 3 billion / 50 . 1 % ) , protestant ##ism ( 92 ##0 million / 36 . 7 % ) , the eastern orthodox church ( 260 million ) and oriental orthodoxy ( 86 million / both together 11 . 9 % ) , amid various efforts toward unity ( ec ##umen ##ism ) . [SEP]
[CLS] their creed ##s generally hold in common jesus as the son of god — the logos inca ##rna ##ted — who mini ##st ##red , suffered , and died on a cross , but rose from the dead for the salvation of mankind ; as referred to as the gospel , meaning the " good news " , in the bible ( scripture ) . [SEP]
[CLS] describing jesus ' life and teachings are the four canonical gospels of matthew , mark , luke and john with the jewish old testament as the gospel ' s respected background . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity and christian ethics played a prominent role in the development of western civilization , particularly around europe from late antiquity and the middle ages . [SEP]
[CLS] despite a decline in adherence in the west , christianity remains the dominant religion in the region , with about 70 % of the population identifying as christian . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity is growing in africa and asia , the world ' s most populous continents . [SEP]
[CLS] in the new testament , the names by which the disciples were known among themselves were " brethren " , " the faithful " , " elect " , " saints " and " believers " . [SEP]
[CLS] early jewish christians referred to themselves as ' the way ' , probably coming from , " prepare the way of the lord . " [SEP]
[CLS] according to , the term " christian " was first used in reference to jesus ' s disciples in the city of antioch , meaning " followers of christ , " by the non - jewish inhabitants of antioch . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest recorded use of the term " christianity " was by ignatius of antioch , in around 100 ad . [SEP]
[CLS] while christians worldwide share basic convictions , there are also differences of interpretations and opinions of the bible and sacred traditions on which christianity is based . [SEP]
[CLS] con ##cise doc ##tri ##nal statements or confessions of religious beliefs are known as creed ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] they began as baptism ##al formula ##e and were later expanded during the christ ##ological controversies of the 4th and 5th centuries to become statements of faith . [SEP]
[CLS] the apostles ' creed is the most widely accepted statement of the articles of christian faith . [SEP]
[CLS] it is used by a number of christian denominations for both liturgical and cat ##eche ##tical purposes , most visibly by liturgical churches of western christian tradition , including the latin church of the catholic church , lutheran ##ism , anglican ##ism , and western rite orthodoxy . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also used by presbyterian ##s , methodist ##s , and congregational ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] this particular creed was developed between the 2nd and 9th centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] its central doctrines are those of the trinity and god the creator . [SEP]
[CLS] each of the doctrines found in this creed can be traced to statements current in the apostolic period . [SEP]
[CLS] the creed was apparently used as a summary of christian doctrine for baptism ##al candidates in the churches of rome . [SEP]
[CLS] the nice ##ne creed was formulated , largely in response to aria ##nism , at the councils of nic ##aea and constantinople in 325 and 381 respectively , and ratified as the universal creed of christ ##end ##om by the first council of ep ##hes ##us in 43 ##1 . [SEP]
[CLS] the cha ##lce ##don ##ian definition , or creed of cha ##lce ##don , developed at the council of cha ##lce ##don in 451 , though rejected by the oriental orthodox , taught christ " to be acknowledged in two nature ##s , inc ##on ##fus ##edly , un ##chang ##ea ##bly , ind ##iv ##isi ##bly , ins ##ep ##ara ##bly " : one divine and one human , and that both nature ##s , while perfect in themselves , are nevertheless also perfectly united into one person . [SEP]
[CLS] the at ##hana ##sian creed , received in the western church as having the same status as the nice ##ne and cha ##lce ##don ##ian , says : " we worship one god in trinity , and trinity in unity ; neither con ##fo ##und ##ing the persons nor dividing the substance . " [SEP]
[CLS] most christians ( catholic , eastern orthodox , oriental orthodox , and protestant alike ) accept the use of creed ##s , and sub ##scribe to at least one of the creed ##s mentioned above . [SEP]
[CLS] many evangelical protestants reject creed ##s as definitive statements of faith , even while agreeing with some or all of the substance of the creed ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] most baptist ##s do not use creed ##s " in that they have not sought to establish binding authoritative confessions of faith on one another . " [SEP]
[CLS] also rejecting creed ##s are groups with roots in the restoration movement , such as the christian church ( disciples of christ ) , the evangelical christian church in canada , and the churches of christ . [SEP]
[CLS] the central ten ##et of christianity is the belief in jesus as the son of god and the messiah ( christ ) . [SEP]
[CLS] christians believe that jesus , as the messiah , was an ##oint ##ed by god as savior of humanity and hold that jesus ' coming was the fulfillment of mess ##iani ##c prop ##he ##cies of the old testament . [SEP]
[CLS] the christian concept of the messiah differs significantly from the contemporary jewish concept . [SEP]
[CLS] the core christian belief is that through belief in and acceptance of the death and resurrection of jesus , sin ##ful humans can be reconciled to god , and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life . [SEP]
[CLS] while there have been many theological disputes over the nature of jesus over the earliest centuries of christian history , generally , christians believe that jesus is god inca ##rna ##te and " true god and true man " ( or both fully divine and fully human ) . [SEP]
[CLS] jesus , having become fully human , suffered the pains and temptation ##s of a mortal man , but did not sin . [SEP]
[CLS] as fully god , he rose to life again . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the new testament , he rose from the dead , ascended to heaven , is seated at the right hand of the father , and will ultimately return to fulfill the rest of the mess ##iani ##c prophecy , including the resurrection of the dead , the last judgment , and the final establishment of the kingdom of god . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the canonical gospels of matthew and luke , jesus was conceived by the holy spirit and born from the virgin mary . [SEP]
[CLS] little of jesus ' childhood is recorded in the canonical gospels , although infancy gospels were popular in antiquity . [SEP]
[CLS] in comparison , his adulthood , especially the week before his death , is well documented in the gospels contained within the new testament , because that part of his life is believed to be most important . [SEP]
[CLS] the biblical accounts of jesus ' ministry include : his baptism , miracles , preaching , teaching , and deeds . [SEP]
[CLS] christians consider the resurrection of jesus to be the cornerstone of their faith ( see 1 co ##rin ##thi ##ans 15 ) and the most important event in history . [SEP]
[CLS] among christian beliefs , the death and resurrection of jesus are two core events on which much of christian doctrine and theology is based . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the new testament , jesus was cr ##uc ##ified , died a physical death , was buried within a tomb , and rose from the dead three days later . [SEP]
[CLS] the new testament mentions several resurrection appearances of jesus on different occasions to his twelve apostles and disciples , including " more than five hundred brethren at once " , before jesus ' ascension to heaven . [SEP]
[CLS] jesus ' death and resurrection are commemorated by christians in all worship services , with special emphasis during holy week , which includes good friday and easter sunday . [SEP]
[CLS] the death and resurrection of jesus are usually considered the most important events in christian theology , partly because they demonstrate that jesus has power over life and death and therefore has the authority and power to give people eternal life . [SEP]
[CLS] christian churches accept and teach the new testament account of the resurrection of jesus with very few exceptions . [SEP]
[CLS] some modern scholars use the belief of jesus ' followers in the resurrection as a point of departure for establishing the continuity of the historical jesus and the proclamation of the early church . [SEP]
[CLS] some liberal christians do not accept a literal bodily resurrection , seeing the story as richly symbolic and spiritual ##ly no ##uri ##shing myth . [SEP]
[CLS] arguments over death and resurrection claims occur at many religious debates and inter ##fa ##ith dialogues . [SEP]
[CLS] paul the apostle , an early christian convert and missionary , wrote , " if christ was not raised , then all our preaching is useless , and your trust in god is useless . " [SEP]
[CLS] paul the apostle , like jews and roman pagan ##s of his time , believed that sacrifice can bring about new kinship ties , purity , and eternal life . [SEP]
[CLS] for paul , the necessary sacrifice was the death of jesus : gen ##tile ##s who are " christ ' s " are , like israel , descendants of abraham and " heirs according to the promise " . [SEP]
[CLS] the god who raised jesus from the dead would also give new life to the " mortal bodies " of gen ##tile christians , who had become with israel , the " children of god " , and were therefore no longer " in the flesh " . [SEP]
[CLS] modern christian churches tend to be much more concerned with how humanity can be saved from a universal condition of sin and death than the question of how both jews and gen ##tile ##s can be in god ' s family . [SEP]
[CLS] according to eastern orthodox theology , based upon their understanding of the at ##one ##ment as put forward by ir ##ena ##eus ' rec ##ap ##it ##ulation theory , jesus ' death is a ransom . [SEP]
[CLS] this restore ##s the relation with god , who is loving and reaches out to humanity , and offers the possibility of " theo ##sis " c . q . di ##vin ##ization , becoming the kind of humans god wants humanity to be . [SEP]
[CLS] according to catholic doctrine , jesus ' death sat ##is ##fies the wrath of god , aroused by the offense to god ' s honour caused by human ' s sin ##fulness . [SEP]
[CLS] the catholic church teaches that salvation does not occur without faithful ##ness on the part of christians ; converts must live in accordance with principles of love and or ##dina ##rily must be baptized . [SEP]
[CLS] in protestant theology , jesus ' death is regarded as a sub ##sti ##tion ##ary penalty carried by jesus , for the debt that has to be paid by human ##kind when it broke god ' s moral law . [SEP]
[CLS] martin luther taught that baptism was necessary for salvation , but modern lutheran ##s and other protestants tend to teach that salvation is a gift that comes to an individual by god ' s grace , sometimes defined as " un ##mer ##ited favor " , even apart from baptism . [SEP]
[CLS] christians differ in their views on the extent to which individuals ' salvation is pre - ordained by god . [SEP]
[CLS] reformed theology places distinctive emphasis on grace by teaching that individuals are completely incapable of self - redemption , but that san ##ct ##ifying grace is irresistible . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast catholics , orthodox christians , and arm ##inian protestants believe that the exercise of free will is necessary to have faith in jesus . [SEP]
[CLS] " trinity " refers to the teaching that the one god comprises three distinct , eternal ##ly co - existing persons : the " father " , the " son " ( inca ##rna ##te in jesus christ ) , and the " holy spirit " . [SEP]
[CLS] together , these three persons are sometimes called the god ##head , although there is no single term in use in scripture to denote the unified god ##head . [SEP]
[CLS] in the words of the at ##hana ##sian creed , an early statement of christian belief , " the father is god , the son is god , and the holy spirit is god , and yet there are not three gods but one god " . [SEP]
[CLS] they are distinct from another : the father has no source , the son is beg ##otte ##n of the father , and the spirit proceeds from the father . [SEP]
[CLS] though distinct , the three persons cannot be divided from one another in being or in operation . [SEP]
[CLS] while some christians also believe that god appeared as the father in the old testament , it is agreed that he appeared as the son in the new testament , and will still continue to manifest as the holy spirit in the present . [SEP]
[CLS] but still , god still existed as three persons in each of these times . [SEP]
[CLS] however , traditionally there is a belief that it was the son who appeared in the old testament because , for example , when the trinity is depicted in art , the son typically has the distinctive appearance , a cr ##uc ##iform halo identifying christ , and in depictions of the garden of eden , this looks forward to an incarnation yet to occur . [SEP]
[CLS] in some early christian sar ##co ##pha ##gi the logos is distinguished with a beard , " which allows him to appear ancient , even pre - existent . " [SEP]
[CLS] the trinity is an essential doctrine of mainstream christianity . [SEP]
[CLS] from earlier than the times of the nice ##ne creed ( 325 ) christianity advocated the tri ##une mystery - nature of god as a norma ##tive profession of faith . [SEP]
[CLS] according to roger e . olson and christopher hall , through prayer , meditation , study and practice , the christian community concluded " that god must exist as both a unity and trinity " , cod ##ifying this in ecumenical council at the end of the 4th century . [SEP]
[CLS] according to this doctrine , god is not divided in the sense that each person has a third of the whole ; rather , each person is considered to be fully god ( see per ##ich ##ores ##is ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the distinction lies in their relations , the father being un ##be ##go ##tten ; the son being beg ##otte ##n of the father ; and the holy spirit proceeding from the father and ( in western christian theology ) from the son . [SEP]
[CLS] regardless of this apparent difference , the three " persons " are each eternal and om ##ni ##pot ##ent . [SEP]
[CLS] other christian religions including unitarian universal ##ism , je ##ho ##vah ' s witnesses , and mormon ##ism , do not share those views on the trinity . [SEP]
[CLS] the greek word " tri ##as " is first seen in this sense in the works of theo ##phi ##lus of antioch ; his text reads : " of the trinity , of god , and of his word , and of his wisdom " . [SEP]
[CLS] the term may have been in use before this time ; its latin equivalent , " tri ##ni ##tas " , appears afterwards with an explicit reference to the father , the son , and the holy spirit , in ter ##tu ##lli ##an . [SEP]
[CLS] in the following century , the word was in general use . [SEP]
[CLS] it is found in many passages of or ##igen . [SEP]
[CLS] " tri ##ni ##tarian ##ism " denotes christians who believe in the concept of the trinity . [SEP]
[CLS] almost all christian denominations and churches hold tri ##ni ##tarian beliefs . [SEP]
[CLS] although the words " trinity " and " tri ##une " do not appear in the bible , theologians , beginning in the 3rd century , developed the term and concept to facilitate comprehension of the new testament teachings of god as being father , son , and holy spirit . [SEP]
[CLS] since that time , christian theologians have been careful to emphasize that trinity does not imply that there are three gods ( the anti ##tri ##ni ##tarian heresy of tri ##the ##ism ) , nor that each h ##yp ##osta ##sis of the trinity is one - third of an infinite god ( partial ##ism ) , nor that the son and the holy spirit are beings created by and subordinate to the father ( aria ##nism ) . [SEP]
[CLS] rather , the trinity is defined as one god in three persons . [SEP]
[CLS] " non ##tri ##ni ##tarian ##ism " ( or " anti ##tri ##ni ##tarian ##ism " ) refers to theology that rejects the doctrine of the trinity . [SEP]
[CLS] various non ##tri ##ni ##tarian views , such as adoption ##ism or mod ##alis ##m , existed in early christianity , leading to the disputes about christ ##ology . [SEP]
[CLS] non ##tri ##ni ##tarian ##ism later appeared again in the g ##nostic ##ism of the cat ##har ##s between the 11th and 13th centuries , among groups with unitarian theology in the protestant reformation of the 16th century , in the 18th - century enlightenment , and in some groups arising during the second great awakening of the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] the end of things , whether the end of an individual life , the end of the age , or the end of the world , broadly speaking , is christian es ##cha ##tology ; the study of the destiny of humans as it is revealed in the bible . [SEP]
[CLS] the major issues in christian es ##cha ##tology are the tri ##bula ##tion , death and the afterlife , the rap ##ture , the second coming of jesus , resurrection of the dead , heaven and hell , millennia ##lism , the last judgment , the end of the world , and the new heavens and new earth . [SEP]
[CLS] christians believe that the second coming of christ will occur at the end of time , after a period of severe persecution ( the great tri ##bula ##tion ) . [SEP]
[CLS] all who have died will be resurrected bodily from the dead for the last judgment . [SEP]
[CLS] jesus will fully establish the kingdom of god in fulfillment of script ##ural prop ##he ##cies . [SEP]
[CLS] most christians believe that human beings experience divine judgment and are rewarded either with eternal life or eternal damn ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] this includes the general judgement at the resurrection of the dead as well as the belief ( held by catholics , orthodox and most protestants ) in a judgment particular to the individual soul upon physical death . [SEP]
[CLS] in catholicism , those who die in a state of grace , i . e . , without any mortal sin separating them from god , but are still imperfect ##ly pu ##rified from the effects of sin , undergo purification through the intermediate state of pu ##rga ##tory to achieve the holiness necessary for entrance into god ' s presence . [SEP]
[CLS] those who have attained this goal are called " saints " ( latin " san ##ctus " , " holy " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some christian groups , such as seventh - day adventist ##s , hold to mortal ##ism , the belief that the human soul is not naturally immortal , and is unconscious during the intermediate state between bodily death and resurrection . [SEP]
[CLS] these christians also hold to ann ##ih ##ilation ##ism , the belief that subsequent to the final judgement , the wicked will cease to exist rather than suffer ever ##las ##ting torment . [SEP]
[CLS] je ##ho ##vah ' s witnesses hold to a similar view . [SEP]
[CLS] depending on the specific denomination of christianity , practices may include baptism , eu ##cha ##rist ( holy communion or the lord ' s supper ) , prayer ( including the lord ' s prayer ) , confession , confirmation , burial rites , marriage rites and the religious education of children . [SEP]
[CLS] most denominations have ordained clergy and hold regular group worship services . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , as justin described , christians assemble for communal worship on sunday , the day of the resurrection , though other liturgical practices often occur outside this setting . [SEP]
[CLS] scripture readings are drawn from the old and new testament ##s , but especially the gospel accounts . [SEP]
[CLS] often these are arranged on an annual cycle , using a book called a le ##ction ##ary . [SEP]
[CLS] instruction is given based on these readings , called a sermon , or ho ##mi ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] there are a variety of congregational prayers , including thanksgiving , confession , and inter ##ces ##sion , which occur throughout the service and take a variety of forms including recited , responsive , silent , or sung . [SEP]
[CLS] the lord ' s prayer , or our father , is regularly prayed . [SEP]
[CLS] some groups depart from this traditional liturgical structure . [SEP]
[CLS] a division is often made between " high " church services , characterized by greater solemn ##ity and ritual , and " low " services , but even within these two categories , there is great diversity in forms of worship . [SEP]
[CLS] seventh - day adventist ##s meet on saturday , while others do not meet on a weekly basis . [SEP]
[CLS] charismatic or pen ##tec ##ostal congregations may spontaneously feel led by the holy spirit to action rather than follow a formal order of service , including spontaneous prayer . [SEP]
[CLS] quakers sit quietly until moved by the holy spirit to speak . [SEP]
[CLS] some evangelical services resemble concerts with rock and pop music , dancing and use of multimedia . [SEP]
[CLS] for groups which do not recognize a priesthood distinct from ordinary believers , the services are generally led by a minister , preacher , or pastor . [SEP]
[CLS] still others may lack any formal leaders , either in principle or by local necessity . [SEP]
[CLS] some churches use only a cappella music , either on principle ( for example , many churches of christ object to the use of instruments in worship ) or by tradition ( as in orthodoxy ) . [SEP]
[CLS] nearly all forms of church ##manship celebrate the eu ##cha ##rist ( holy communion ) , which consists of a consecrated meal . [SEP]
[CLS] it is re ##ena ##cted in accordance with jesus ' instruction at the last supper that his followers do in remembrance of him as when he gave his disciples bread , saying , " this is my body " , and gave them wine saying , " this is my blood " . [SEP]
[CLS] some christian denominations practice closed communion . [SEP]
[CLS] they offer communion to those who are already united in that denomination or sometimes individual church . [SEP]
[CLS] catholics restrict participation to their members who are not in a state of mortal sin . [SEP]
[CLS] most other churches practice open communion since they view communion as a means to unity , rather than an end , and invite all believing christians to participate . [SEP]
[CLS] worship can be varied for special events like baptism ##s or weddings in the service or significant feast days . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early church , christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the eu ##cha ##rist ##ic part of the worship . [SEP]
[CLS] in many churches today , adults and children will separate for all or some of the service to receive age - appropriate teaching . [SEP]
[CLS] such children ' s worship is often called sunday school or sabbath school ( sunday schools are often held before rather than during services ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in christian belief and practice , a " sacrament " is a rite , instituted by christ , that con ##fers grace , con ##stituting a sacred mystery . [SEP]
[CLS] the term is derived from the latin word " sacrament ##um " , which was used to translate the greek word for " mystery " . [SEP]
[CLS] views concerning both which rites are sacrament ##al , and what it means for an act to be a sacrament , vary among christian denominations and traditions . [SEP]
[CLS] the most conventional functional definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign , instituted by christ , that convey ##s an inward , spiritual grace through christ . [SEP]
[CLS] the two most widely accepted sacrament ##s are baptism and the eu ##cha ##rist ( or holy communion ) , however , the majority of christians also recognize five additional sacrament ##s : confirmation ( chris ##mation in the orthodox tradition ) , holy orders ( ordination ) , pena ##nce ( or confession ) , an ##oint ##ing of the sick , and mat ##rim ##ony ( see christian views on marriage ) . [SEP]
[CLS] taken together , these are the seven sacrament ##s as recognized by churches in the high church tradition — notably catholic , eastern orthodox , oriental orthodox , independent catholic , old catholic , many anglican ##s , and some lutheran ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] most other denominations and traditions typically af ##firm only baptism and eu ##cha ##rist as sacrament ##s , while some protestant groups , such as the quakers , reject sacrament ##al theology . [SEP]
[CLS] christian denominations , such as baptist ##s , which believe these rites do not communicate grace , prefer to call baptism and holy communion " ordinance ##s " rather than sacrament ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to this , the church of the east has two additional sacrament ##s in place of the traditional sacrament ##s of mat ##rim ##ony and the an ##oint ##ing of the sick . [SEP]
[CLS] these include holy leave ##n ( mel ##ka ) and the sign of the cross . [SEP]
[CLS] catholics , anglican ##s , eastern christians , and traditional protestant communities frame worship around the liturgical year . [SEP]
[CLS] the liturgical cycle divides the year into a series of seasons , each with their theological em ##pha ##ses , and modes of prayer , which can be sign ##ified by different ways of decor ##ating churches , colours of para ##ments and vest ##ments for clergy , script ##ural readings , themes for preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in the home . [SEP]
[CLS] western christian liturgical calendar ##s are based on the cycle of the roman rite of the catholic church , and eastern christians use analogous calendar ##s based on the cycle of their respective rites . [SEP]
[CLS] calendar ##s set aside holy days , such as solemn ##ities which commemorate an event in the life of jesus , mary , or the saints , and periods of fast ##ing , such as lent and other pious events such as memo ##ria , or lesser festivals commemorating saints . [SEP]
[CLS] christian groups that do not follow a liturgical tradition often retain certain celebrations , such as christmas , easter , and pen ##tec ##ost : these are the celebrations of christ ' s birth , resurrection , and the descent of the holy spirit upon the church , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] a few denominations make no use of a liturgical calendar . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity has not generally practiced an ##icon ##ism , the avoidance or prohibition of devotion ##al images , even if early jewish christians and some modern denominations , in ##voking the dec ##alo ##gue ' s prohibition of idol ##at ##ry , avoided figures in their symbols . [SEP]
[CLS] the cross , today one of the most widely recognized symbols , was used by christians from the earliest times . [SEP]
[CLS] ter ##tu ##lli ##an , in his book " de corona " , tells how it was already a tradition for christians to trace the sign of the cross on their forehead ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] although the cross was known to the early christians , the cr ##uc ##if ##ix did not appear in use until the 5th century . [SEP]
[CLS] among the earliest christian symbols , that of the fish or ich ##thy ##s seems to have ranked first in importance , as seen on monumental sources such as tombs from the first decades of the 2nd century . [SEP]
[CLS] its popularity seemingly arose from the greek word " ich ##thy ##s " ( fish ) forming an acronym for the greek phrase " ie ##so ##us christ ##os theo ##u yi ##os so ##ter " ( ι ##η ##σ ##ου ##ς χ ##ρ ##ι ##σ ##τ ##ος , θ ##ε ##ου υ ##ι ##ος , σ ##ω ##τ ##η ##ρ ) , ( jesus christ , son of god , savior ) , a con ##cise summary of christian faith . [SEP]
[CLS] other major christian symbols include the chi - r ##ho mono ##gram , the dove ( symbolic of the holy spirit ) , the sac ##ri ##fi ##cial lamb ( representing christ ' s sacrifice ) , the vine ( symbol ##izing the connection of the christian with christ ) and many others . [SEP]
[CLS] these all derive from passages of the new testament . [SEP]
[CLS] baptism is the ritual act , with the use of water , by which a person is admitted to membership of the church . [SEP]
[CLS] beliefs on baptism vary among denominations . [SEP]
[CLS] differences occur firstly on whether the act has any spiritual significance . [SEP]
[CLS] some , such as the catholic and eastern orthodox churches , as well as lutheran ##s and anglican ##s , hold to the doctrine of baptism ##al regeneration , which af ##firm ##s that baptism creates or strengthen ##s a person ' s faith , and is intimately linked to salvation . [SEP]
[CLS] others view baptism as a purely symbolic act , an external public declaration of the inward change which has taken place in the person , but not as spiritual ##ly e ##ffi ##ca ##cious . [SEP]
[CLS] secondly , there are differences of opinion on the methodology of the act . [SEP]
[CLS] these methods are : by " immersion " ; if immersion is total , by " sub ##mers ##ion " ; by af ##fusion ( pouring ) ; and by as ##pers ##ion ( sp ##rin ##kling ) . [SEP]
[CLS] those who hold the first view may also adhere to the tradition of infant baptism ; the orthodox churches all practice infant baptism and always ba ##pt ##ize by total immersion repeated three times in the name of the father , the son , and the holy spirit . [SEP]
[CLS] the catholic church also practices infant baptism , usually by af ##fusion , and utilizing the tri ##ni ##tarian formula . [SEP]
[CLS] jesus ' teaching on prayer in the sermon on the mount displays a distinct lack of interest in the external aspects of prayer . [SEP]
[CLS] a concern with the techniques of prayer is condemned as " pagan " , and instead a simple trust in god ' s father ##ly goodness is encouraged . [SEP]
[CLS] elsewhere in the new testament , this same freedom of access to god is also emphasized . [SEP]
[CLS] this confident position should be understood in light of christian belief in the unique relationship between the believer and christ through the ind ##well ##ing of the holy spirit . [SEP]
[CLS] in subsequent christian traditions , certain physical gestures are emphasized , including medieval gestures such as gen ##uf ##le ##ction or making the sign of the cross . [SEP]
[CLS] kneeling , bowing , and pro ##stra ##tions ( see also po ##k ##lon ) are often practiced in more traditional branches of christianity . [SEP]
[CLS] frequently in western christianity , the hands are placed palms together and forward as in the feudal commendation ceremony . [SEP]
[CLS] at other times the older or ##ans posture may be used , with palms up and elbows in . [SEP]
[CLS] " inter ##ces ##sor ##y prayer " is prayer offered for the benefit of other people . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many inter ##ces ##sor ##y prayers recorded in the bible , including prayers of the apostle peter on behalf of sick persons and by prophets of the old testament in favor of other people . [SEP]
[CLS] in the ep ##istle of james , no distinction is made between the inter ##ces ##sor ##y prayer offered by ordinary believers and the prominent old testament prophet elijah . [SEP]
[CLS] the effectiveness of prayer in christianity derives from the power of god rather than the status of the one praying . [SEP]
[CLS] the ancient church , in both eastern and western christianity , developed a tradition of asking for the inter ##ces ##sion of ( deceased ) saints , and this remains the practice of most eastern orthodox , oriental orthodox , catholic , and some anglican churches . [SEP]
[CLS] churches of the protestant reformation , however , rejected prayer to the saints , largely on the basis of the sole media ##tors ##hip of christ . [SEP]
[CLS] the reformer hu ##ld ##ry ##ch z ##wing ##li admitted that he had offered prayers to the saints until his reading of the bible convinced him that this was idol ##at ##rous . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the cat ##ech ##ism of the catholic church : " prayer is the raising of one ' s mind and heart to god or the requesting of good things from god . " [SEP]
[CLS] the book of common prayer in the anglican tradition is a guide which provides a set order for church services , containing set prayers , scripture readings , and hymns or sung psalms . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity , like other religions , has adherents whose beliefs and biblical interpretations vary . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity regards the biblical canon , the old testament and the new testament , as the inspired word of god . [SEP]
[CLS] the traditional view of inspiration is that god worked through human authors so that what they produced was what god wished to communicate . [SEP]
[CLS] the greek word referring to inspiration in is " theo ##p ##ne ##ust ##os " , which literally means " god - breathed " . [SEP]
[CLS] some believe that divine inspiration makes our present bible ##s in ##er ##rant . [SEP]
[CLS] others claim in ##er ##ran ##cy for the bible in its original manuscripts , although none of those are extant . [SEP]
[CLS] still others maintain that only a particular translation is in ##er ##rant , such as the king james version . [SEP]
[CLS] another closely related view is biblical in ##fall ##ibility or limited in ##er ##ran ##cy , which af ##firm ##s that the bible is free of error as a guide to salvation , but may include errors on matters such as history , geography , or science . [SEP]
[CLS] the books of the bible accepted by the orthodox , catholic , and protestant churches vary somewhat , with jews accepting only the hebrew bible as canonical ; however , there is substantial overlap . [SEP]
[CLS] these variations are a reflection of the range of traditions , and of the councils that have convened on the subject . [SEP]
[CLS] every version of the old testament always includes the books of the tan ##akh , the canon of the hebrew bible . [SEP]
[CLS] the catholic and orthodox canons , in addition to the tan ##akh , also include the de ##uter ##oca ##non ##ical books as part of the old testament . [SEP]
[CLS] these books appear in the sept ##ua ##gin ##t , but are regarded by protestants to be ap ##oc ##ry ##pha ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] however , they are considered to be important historical documents which help to inform the understanding of words , grammar , and syntax used in the historical period of their conception . [SEP]
[CLS] some versions of the bible include a separate ap ##oc ##ry ##pha section between the old testament and the new testament . [SEP]
[CLS] the new testament , originally written in ko ##ine greek , contains 27 books which are agreed upon by all churches . [SEP]
[CLS] modern scholarship has raised many issues with the bible . [SEP]
[CLS] while the king james version is held to by many because of its striking english prose , in fact it was translated from the erasmus greek bible , which in turn " was based on a single 12th century manuscript that is one of the worst manuscripts we have available to us " . [SEP]
[CLS] much scholarship in the past several hundred years has gone into comparing different manuscripts in order to rec ##ons ##truct the original text . [SEP]
[CLS] another issue is that several books are considered to be forge ##ries . [SEP]
[CLS] the injunction that women " be silent and sub ##missive " in 1 timothy 2 is thought by many to be a forge ##ry by a follower of paul , a similar phrase in 1 co ##rin ##thi ##ans 14 , which is thought to be by paul , appears in different places in different manuscripts and is thought to originally be a margin note by a copy ##ist . [SEP]
[CLS] other verses in 1 co ##rin ##thi ##ans , such as 1 co ##rin ##thi ##ans 11 : 2 – 16 where women are instructed to wear a covering over their hair " when they pray or prop ##hes ##ies " , contra ##dict this verse . [SEP]
[CLS] a final issue with the bible is the way in which books were selected for inclusion in the new testament . [SEP]
[CLS] other gospels have now been recovered , such as those found near na ##g ham ##mad ##i in 1945 , and while some of these texts are quite different from what christians have been used to , it should be understood that some of this newly recovered gospel material is quite possibly con ##tem ##por ##aneous with , or even earlier than , the new testament gospels . [SEP]
[CLS] the core of the gospel of thomas , in particular , may date from as early as ad 50 ( although some major scholars contest this early dating ) , and if so would provide an insight into the earliest gospel texts that under ##lie the canonical gospels , texts that are mentioned in luke 1 : 1 – 2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the gospel of thomas contains much that is familiar from the canonical gospels — verse 113 , for example ( " the father ' s kingdom is spread out upon the earth , but people do not see it " ) , is reminiscent of luke 17 : 20 – 21 — and the gospel of john , with a terminology and approach that is suggest ##ive of what was later termed " g ##nostic ##ism " , has recently been seen as a possible response to the gospel of thomas , a text that is commonly labelled " proto - g ##nostic " . [SEP]
[CLS] scholarship , then , is currently exploring the relationship in the early church between mystical speculation and experience on the one hand and the search for church order on the other , by analyzing new - found texts , by subject ##ing canonical texts to further scrutiny , and by an examination of the passage of new testament texts to canonical status . [SEP]
[CLS] in antiquity , two schools of ex ##ege ##sis developed in alexandria and antioch . [SEP]
[CLS] the alexandria ##n interpretation , exemplified by or ##igen , tended to read scripture all ##egorical ##ly , while the antioch ##ene interpretation adhere ##d to the literal sense , holding that other meanings ( called " theo ##ria " ) could only be accepted if based on the literal meaning . [SEP]
[CLS] catholic theology distinguishes two senses of scripture : the literal and the spiritual . [SEP]
[CLS] the " literal " sense of understanding scripture is the meaning conveyed by the words of scripture . [SEP]
[CLS] protestant christians believe that the bible is a self - sufficient revelation , the final authority on all christian doctrine , and revealed all truth necessary for salvation . [SEP]
[CLS] this concept is known as " sol ##a script ##ura " . [SEP]
[CLS] protestants characteristic ##ally believe that ordinary believers may reach an adequate understanding of scripture because scripture itself is clear in its meaning ( or " per ##sp ##ic ##uous " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] martin luther believed that without god ' s help , scripture would be " enveloped in darkness " . [SEP]
[CLS] he advocated for " one definite and simple understanding of scripture " . [SEP]
[CLS] john calvin wrote , " all who refuse not to follow the holy spirit as their guide , find in the scripture a clear light " . [SEP]
[CLS] related to this is " efficacy " , that scripture is able to lead people to faith ; and " su ##ffi ##ciency " , that the scriptures contain everything that one needs to know in order to obtain salvation and to live a christian life . [SEP]
[CLS] protestants stress the meaning conveyed by the words of scripture , the historical - grammatical method . [SEP]
[CLS] the historical - grammatical method or gram ##matic ##o - historical method is an effort in biblical her ##men ##eu ##tics to find the intended original meaning in the text . [SEP]
[CLS] this original intended meaning of the text is drawn out through examination of the passage in light of the grammatical and syn ##ta ##ctic ##al aspects , the historical background , the literary genre , as well as theological ( canonical ) considerations . [SEP]
[CLS] the historical - grammatical method distinguishes between the one original meaning and the significance of the text . [SEP]
[CLS] the significance of the text includes the ensuing use of the text or application . [SEP]
[CLS] the original passage is seen as having only a single meaning or sense . [SEP]
[CLS] as milton s . terry said : " a fundamental principle in gram ##matic ##o - historical exposition is that the words and sentences can have but one significance in one and the same connection . [SEP]
[CLS] the moment we neglect this principle we drift out upon a sea of uncertainty and conjecture . " [SEP]
[CLS] technically speaking , the grammatical - historical method of interpretation is distinct from the determination of the passage ' s significance in light of that interpretation . [SEP]
[CLS] taken together , both define the term ( biblical ) her ##men ##eu ##tics . [SEP]
[CLS] some protestant interpreter ##s make use of ty ##pol ##ogy . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity developed during the 1st century ce as a jewish christian sect of second temple judaism . [SEP]
[CLS] an early jewish christian community was founded in jerusalem under the leadership of the pillars of the church , namely james the just , the brother of the lord , saint peter , and john . [SEP]
[CLS] they had known jesus , and , according to paul , the arise ##n christ had first appeared to james and peter . [SEP]
[CLS] jewish christianity soon attracted gen ##tile god - fear ##ers , posing a problem for its jewish religious outlook , which insisted on close ob ##ser ##vance of the jewish commands . [SEP]
[CLS] paul the apostle solved this by insisting that salvation by faith in christ , and participation in his death and resurrection , su ##ffi ##ced . [SEP]
[CLS] at first he persecuted the early christians , but after a conversion experience he preached to the gen ##tile ##s , and is regarded as having had a format ##ive effect on the emerging christian identity as separate from judaism . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , his departure from jewish customs would result in the establishment of christianity as an independent religion . [SEP]
[CLS] this format ##ive period was followed by the early bishops , whom christians consider the successors of christ ' s apostles . [SEP]
[CLS] from the year 150 , christian teachers began to produce theological and apologetic works aimed at defending the faith . [SEP]
[CLS] these authors are known as the church fathers , and the study of them is called pat ##rist ##ics . [SEP]
[CLS] notable early fathers include ignatius of antioch , poly ##car ##p , justin martyr , ir ##ena ##eus , ter ##tu ##lli ##an , clement of alexandria and or ##igen . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the new testament , christians were from the beginning , subject to persecution by some jewish and roman religious authorities . [SEP]
[CLS] this involved punishments , including death , for christians such as stephen and james , son of ze ##bed ##ee . [SEP]
[CLS] further widespread persecution of the church occurred under nine subsequent roman emperors , most intensely under dec ##ius and di ##oc ##let ##ian . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity spread to aramaic - speaking peoples along the mediterranean coast and also to the inland parts of the roman empire and beyond that into the part ##hian empire and the later sas ##anian empire , including mesopotamia , which was dominated at different times and to varying extent ##s by these empires . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence of christianity in africa began in the middle of the 1st century in egypt and by the end of the 2nd century in the region around carthage . [SEP]
[CLS] mark the evangelist is claimed to have started the church of alexandria in about 43 ce ; various later churches claim this as their own legacy , including the coptic orthodox church of alexandria . [SEP]
[CLS] important africans who influenced the early development of christianity include ter ##tu ##lli ##an , clement of alexandria , or ##igen of alexandria , cy ##pr ##ian , at ##hana ##sius , and augustine of hip ##po . [SEP]
[CLS] by 201 or earlier , under king ab ##gar the great , os ##ro ##ene became the first christian state . [SEP]
[CLS] king tr ##da ##t iv made christianity the state religion in armenia between 301 and 314 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was not an entirely new religion in armenia , having penetrated into the country from at least the third century , but it may have been present even earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] under emperor constantine , state - sanctioned persecution of early christians ended with the edict of to ##ler ##ation in 311 and the edict of milan in 313 . [SEP]
[CLS] at that point , christianity was still a minority belief , comprising perhaps only five percent of the roman population . [SEP]
[CLS] influenced by his adviser mar ##don ##ius , constantine ' s nephew julian unsuccessfully tried to suppress christianity . [SEP]
[CLS] on 27 february 380 , theo ##dos ##ius i , gr ##ati ##an , and valentin ##ian ii established nice ##ne christianity as the state church of the roman empire . [SEP]
[CLS] as soon as it became connected to the state , christianity grew wealthy ; the church sol ##ici ##ted donations from the rich and could now own land . [SEP]
[CLS] constantine was also instrumental in the con ##vocation of the first council of nic ##aea in 325 , which sought to address aria ##nism and formulated the nice ##ne creed , which is still used by the catholic church , eastern orthodoxy , anglican communion , and many protestant churches . [SEP]
[CLS] nic ##aea was the first of a series of ecumenical councils , which formally defined critical elements of the theology of the church , notably concerning christ ##ology . [SEP]
[CLS] the church of the east did not accept the third and following ecumenical councils and is still separate today by its successors ( assyrian church of the east ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in terms of prosperity and cultural life , the byzantine empire was one of the peaks in christian history and christian civilization , and constantinople remained the leading city of the christian world in size , wealth , and culture . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a renewed interest in classical greek philosophy , as well as an increase in literary output in vernacular greek . [SEP]
[CLS] byzantine art and literature held a pre ##emi ##nent place in europe , and the cultural impact of byzantine art on the west during this period was enormous and of long - lasting significance . [SEP]
[CLS] the later rise of islam in north africa reduced the size and numbers of christian congregations , leaving in large numbers only the coptic church in egypt , the ethiopian orthodox te ##wa ##hed ##o church in the horn of africa and the nu ##bian church in the sudan ( no ##bat ##ia , ma ##kur ##ia and al ##od ##ia ) . [SEP]
[CLS] with the decline and fall of the roman empire in the west , the papacy became a political player , first visible in pope leo ' s diplomatic dealings with hu ##ns and van ##dal ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the church also entered into a long period of missionary activity and expansion among the various tribes . [SEP]
[CLS] while aria ##nist ##s instituted the death penalty for practicing pagan ##s ( see the massacre of verde ##n , for example ) , what would later become catholicism also spread among the hungarians , the germanic , the celtic , the baltic and some slavic peoples . [SEP]
[CLS] around 500 , st . benedict set out his monastic rule , establishing a system of regulations for the foundation and running of monasteries . [SEP]
[CLS] monastic ##ism became a powerful force throughout europe , and gave rise to many early centers of learning , most famously in ireland , scotland , and gaul , contributing to the carol ##ing ##ian renaissance of the 9th century . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 7th century , muslims conquered syria ( including jerusalem ) , north africa , and spain , converting some of the christian population to islam , and placing the rest under a separate legal status . [SEP]
[CLS] part of the muslims ' success was due to the exhaustion of the byzantine empire in its decades long conflict with persia . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning in the 8th century , with the rise of carol ##ing ##ian leaders , the papacy sought greater political support in the frankish kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] the middle ages brought about major changes within the church . [SEP]
[CLS] pope gregory the great dramatically reformed the ecclesiastical structure and administration . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 8th century , icon ##oc ##las ##m became a di ##vis ##ive issue , when it was sponsored by the byzantine emperors . [SEP]
[CLS] the second ecumenical council of nic ##aea ( 78 ##7 ) finally pronounced in favor of icons . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 10th century , western christian monastic ##ism was further re ##ju ##ven ##ated through the leadership of the great benedictine monastery of cl ##un ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] in the west , from the 11th century onward , some older cathedral schools became universities ( see , for example , university of oxford , university of paris and university of bologna ) . [SEP]
[CLS] previously , higher education had been the domain of christian cathedral schools or monastic schools ( " sc ##hol ##ae monastic ##ae " ) , led by monks and nuns . [SEP]
[CLS] evidence of such schools dates back to the 6th century ce . [SEP]
[CLS] these new universities expanded the curriculum to include academic programs for cleric ##s , lawyers , civil servants , and physicians . [SEP]
[CLS] originally teaching only theology , universities steadily added subjects including medicine , philosophy , and law , becoming the direct ancestors of modern institutions of learning . [SEP]
[CLS] the university is generally regarded as an institution that has its origin in the medieval christian setting . [SEP]
[CLS] accompanying the rise of the " new towns " throughout europe , men ##dic ##ant orders were founded , bringing the consecrated religious life out of the monastery and into the new urban setting . [SEP]
[CLS] the two principal men ##dic ##ant movements were the franciscan ##s and the dominican ##s , founded by st . francis and st . dominic , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] both orders made significant contributions to the development of the great universities of europe . [SEP]
[CLS] another new order was the cis ##ter ##cian ##s , whose large isolated monasteries spearheaded the settlement of former wilderness areas . [SEP]
[CLS] in this period , church building and ecclesiastical architecture reached new heights , culminating in the orders of romanesque and gothic architecture and the building of the great european cathedral ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] from 109 ##5 under the pont ##ific ##ate of urban ii , the crusade ##s were launched . [SEP]
[CLS] these were a series of military campaigns in the holy land and elsewhere , initiated in response to pleas from the byzantine emperor alex ##ios i for aid against turkish expansion . [SEP]
[CLS] the crusade ##s ultimately failed to st ##if ##le islamic aggression and even contributed to christian en ##mity with the sack ##ing of constantinople during the fourth crusade . [SEP]
[CLS] the christian church experienced internal conflict between the 7th and 13th centuries that resulted in a sc ##hism between the so - called latin or western christian branch ( the catholic church ) , and an eastern , largely greek , branch ( the eastern orthodox church ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the two sides disagreed on a number of administrative , liturgical and doc ##tri ##nal issues , most notably papal prima ##cy of jurisdiction . [SEP]
[CLS] the second council of lyon ( 127 ##4 ) and the council of florence ( 143 ##9 ) attempted to reunite the churches , but in both cases , the eastern orthodox refused to implement the decisions , and the two principal churches remain in sc ##hism to the present day . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the catholic church has achieved union with various smaller eastern churches . [SEP]
[CLS] in the thirteenth century , a new emphasis on jesus ' suffering , exemplified by the franciscan ##s ' preaching , had the consequence of turning worship ##pers ' attention towards jews , on whom christians had placed the blame for jesus ' death . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity ' s limited tolerance of jews was not new — augustine of hip ##po said that jews should not be allowed to enjoy the citizenship that christians took for granted — but the growing anti ##pathy towards jews was a factor that led to the expulsion of jews from england in 129 ##0 , the first of many such expulsion ##s in europe . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning around 118 ##4 , following the crusade against cat ##har heresy , various institutions , broadly referred to as the inquisition , were established with the aim of suppress ##ing heresy and securing religious and doc ##tri ##nal unity within christianity through conversion and prosecution . [SEP]
[CLS] the 15th - century renaissance brought about a renewed interest in ancient and classical learning . [SEP]
[CLS] during the reformation , martin luther posted the " ninety - five these ##s " 151 ##7 against the sale of ind ##ul ##gence ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] printed copies soon spread throughout europe . [SEP]
[CLS] in 152 ##1 the edict of worms condemned and ex ##com ##mun ##icated luther and his followers , resulting in the sc ##hism of the western christ ##end ##om into several branches . [SEP]
[CLS] other reformer ##s like z ##wing ##li , o ##ec ##ola ##mp ##adi ##us , calvin , knox , and arm ##ini ##us further criticized catholic teaching and worship . [SEP]
[CLS] these challenges developed into the movement called protestant ##ism , which rep ##udi ##ated the prima ##cy of the pope , the role of tradition , the seven sacrament ##s , and other doctrines and practices . [SEP]
[CLS] the reformation in england began in 153 ##4 , when king henry viii had himself declared head of the church of england . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning in 153 ##6 , the monasteries throughout england , wales and ireland were dissolved . [SEP]
[CLS] thomas mu ##nt ##zer , andreas karl ##stadt and other theologians perceived both the catholic church and the confessions of the mag ##ister ##ial reformation as corrupted . [SEP]
[CLS] their activity brought about the radical reformation , which gave birth to various ana ##ba ##pt ##ist denominations . [SEP]
[CLS] partly in response to the protestant reformation , the catholic church engaged in a substantial process of reform and renewal , known as the counter - reformation or catholic reform . [SEP]
[CLS] the council of trent clarified and re ##asse ##rted catholic doctrine . [SEP]
[CLS] during the following centuries , competition between catholicism and protestant ##ism became deeply en ##tangled with political struggles among european states . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , the discovery of america by christopher columbus in 149 ##2 brought about a new wave of missionary activity . [SEP]
[CLS] partly from missionary ze ##al , but under the impetus of colonial expansion by the european powers , christianity spread to the americas , oceania , east asia and sub - saharan africa . [SEP]
[CLS] throughout europe , the division caused by the reformation led to outbreak ##s of religious violence and the establishment of separate state churches in europe . [SEP]
[CLS] lutheran ##ism spread into the northern , central , and eastern parts of present - day germany , liv ##onia , and scandinavia . [SEP]
[CLS] anglican ##ism was established in england in 153 ##4 . [SEP]
[CLS] calvin ##ism and its varieties , such as presbyterian ##ism , were introduced in scotland , the netherlands , hungary , switzerland , and france . [SEP]
[CLS] arm ##inian ##ism gained followers in the netherlands and fr ##isi ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] ultimately , these differences led to the outbreak of conflicts in which religion played a key factor . [SEP]
[CLS] the thirty years ' war , the english civil war , and the french wars of religion are prominent examples . [SEP]
[CLS] these events intensified the christian debate on persecution and to ##ler ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] in the era known as the great diver ##gence , when in the west , the age of enlightenment and the scientific revolution brought about great societal changes , christianity was confronted with various forms of skepticism and with certain modern political id ##eo ##logies , such as versions of socialism and liberalism . [SEP]
[CLS] events ranged from mere anti - clerical ##ism to violent outburst ##s against christianity , such as the dec ##hri ##sti ##ani ##zation of france during the french revolution , the spanish civil war , and certain marxist movements , especially the russian revolution and the persecution of christians in the soviet union under state at ##hei ##sm . [SEP]
[CLS] especially pressing in europe was the formation of nation states after the napoleonic era . [SEP]
[CLS] in all european countries , different christian denominations found themselves in competition to greater or lesser extent ##s with each other and with the state . [SEP]
[CLS] variables were the relative sizes of the denominations and the religious , political , and ideological orientation of the states . [SEP]
[CLS] ur ##s alter ##mat ##t of the university of fr ##ib ##our ##g , looking specifically at catholicism in europe , identifies four models for the european nations . [SEP]
[CLS] in traditionally catholic - majority countries such as belgium , spain , and austria , to some extent , religious and national communities are more or less identical . [SEP]
[CLS] cultural sy ##mb ##ios ##is and separation are found in poland , the republic of ireland , and switzerland , all countries with competing denominations . [SEP]
[CLS] competition is found in germany , the netherlands , and again switzerland , all countries with minority catholic populations , which to a greater or lesser extent identified with the nation . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , separation between religion ( again , specifically catholicism ) and the state is found to a great degree in france and italy , countries where the state actively opposed itself to the authority of the catholic church . [SEP]
[CLS] the combined factors of the formation of nation states and ultra ##mont ##ani ##sm , especially in germany and the netherlands , but also in england to a much lesser extent , often forced catholic churches , organizations , and believers to choose between the national demands of the state and the authority of the church , specifically the papacy . [SEP]
[CLS] this conflict came to a head in the first vatican council , and in germany would lead directly to the " ku ##lt ##ur ##kam ##pf " , where liberals and protestants under the leadership of bismarck managed to severely restrict catholic expression and organization . [SEP]
[CLS] christian commitment in europe dropped as modern ##ity and secular ##ism came into their own , particularly in the czech republic and estonia , while religious commitments in america have been generally high in comparison to europe . [SEP]
[CLS] the late 20th century has shown the shift of christian adherence to the third world and the southern hemisphere in general , with the west no longer the chief standard bearer of christianity . [SEP]
[CLS] approximately 7 to 10 % of arabs are christians , most prevalent in egypt , syria and lebanon . [SEP]
[CLS] with around 2 . 4 billion adherents , split into three main branches of catholic , protestant , and eastern orthodox , christianity is the world ' s largest religion . [SEP]
[CLS] the christian share of the world ' s population has stood at around 33 % for the last hundred years , which means that one in three persons on earth are christians . [SEP]
[CLS] this masks a major shift in the demographics of christianity ; large increases in the developing world have been accompanied by substantial declines in the developed world , mainly in europe and north america . [SEP]
[CLS] according to a 2015 pew research center study , within the next four decades , christians will remain the world ' s largest religion ; and by 205 ##0 , the christian population is expected to exceed 3 billion . [SEP]
[CLS] as a percentage of christians , the catholic church and orthodoxy ( both eastern and oriental ) are declining in parts of the world ( though catholicism is growing in asia , in africa , vibrant in eastern europe , etc . ) , while protestants and other christians are on the rise in the developing world . [SEP]
[CLS] the so - called " popular protestant ##ism " is one of the fastest growing religious categories in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , catholicism will also continue to grow to 1 . 63 billion by 205 ##0 , according to todd johnson of the center for the study of global christianity . [SEP]
[CLS] africa alone , by 2015 , will be home to 230 million african catholics . [SEP]
[CLS] and if in 2018 , the u . n . projects that africa ' s population will reach 4 . 5 billion by 210 ##0 ( not 2 billion as predicted in 2004 ) , catholicism will indeed grow , as will other religious groups . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity is the predominant religion in europe , the americas , and southern africa . [SEP]
[CLS] in asia , it is the dominant religion in georgia , armenia , east timor , and the philippines . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it is declining in many areas including the northern and western united states , oceania ( australia and new zealand ) , northern europe ( including great britain , scandinavia and other places ) , france , germany , and the canadian provinces of ontario , british columbia , and quebec , and parts of asia ( especially the middle east , due to the christian emigration , south korea , taiwan , and macau ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the christian population is not decreasing in brazil , the southern united states , and the province of alberta , canada , but the percentage is decreasing . [SEP]
[CLS] in countries such as australia and new zealand , the christian population are declining in both numbers and percentage . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the declining numbers , christianity remains the dominant religion in the western world , where 70 % are christians . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2011 pew research center survey found that 76 % of europeans , 73 % in oceania and about 86 % in the americas ( 90 % in latin america and 77 % in north america ) identified themselves as christians . [SEP]
[CLS] by 2010 about 157 countries and territories in the world had christian major ##ities . [SEP]
[CLS] however , there are many charismatic movements that have become well established over large parts of the world , especially africa , latin america , and asia . [SEP]
[CLS] since 1900 , primarily due to conversion , protestant ##ism has spread rapidly in africa , asia , oceania , and latin america . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1960 to 2000 , the global growth of the number of reported evangelical protestants grew three times the world ' s population rate , and twice that of islam . [SEP]
[CLS] a study conducted by st . mary ' s university estimated about 10 . 2 million muslim converts to christianity in 2015 . [SEP]
[CLS] the results also state that significant numbers of muslims converts to christianity in afghanistan , albania , azerbaijan , algeria , belgium , france , germany , iran , india , indonesia , malaysia , morocco , russia , the netherlands , saudi arabia , tunisia , turkey , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , kosovo , the united states , and central asia . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also reported that christianity is popular among people of different backgrounds in india ( mostly hindus ) , and malaysia , mongolia , nigeria , vietnam , singapore , indonesia , china , japan , and south korea . [SEP]
[CLS] in most countries in the developed world , church attendance among people who continue to identify themselves as christians has been falling over the last few decades . [SEP]
[CLS] some sources view this simply as part of a drift away from traditional membership institutions , while others link it to signs of a decline in belief in the importance of religion in general . [SEP]
[CLS] europe ' s christian population , though in decline , still constitutes the largest geographical component of the religion . [SEP]
[CLS] according to data from the 2012 european social survey , around a third of european christians say they attend services once a month or more , conversely about more than two - thirds of latin american christians ; according to the world values survey , about 90 % of african christians ( in ghana , nigeria , r ##wan ##d ] , south africa and zimbabwe ) said they attended church regularly . [SEP]
