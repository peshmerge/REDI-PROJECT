a melody is a musical instrument that is made up of a lot of different musical elements .
melodies often consist of one or more musical phrases or motifs .
given the many and varied elements and styles of melody " many extant explanations of melody confine us to specific stylistic models , and they are too exclusive . "
in 1984 , paul narveson said that more than three-quarters of melodic topics had not been explored thoroughly .
the melodies existing in most european music written before the 20th century , and popular music throughout the 20th century , featured " fixed and easily discernible frequency patterns " , recurring " events , often , at all structural levels " and " recurrence of durations and durations of durations and durations " .
melodies in the 20th century " used a lot of pitch resources than had been the custom in any other historical period of western music . "
composers also gave a structure to " the qualitative dimensions " that previously had been " almost exclusively reserved for pitch and rhythm " .
the same melody may be recognizable when played with a wide variety of timbres and dynamics , but may still be an " element of linear ordering " .
