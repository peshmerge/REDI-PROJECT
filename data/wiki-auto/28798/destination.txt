SNAFU or snafu is an acronym that the United States Military first used.
Civilians now use it as well.
It stands for Situation Normal: All (Fucked/Fouled/Francis) Up.
In modern times, it means a situation that was occurring normally but then suddenly began to go wrong.
"The general's visit this week-end went well until we hit a snafu.
Everything went wrong after that."
Snafu is used mostly as a noun.
It can also be used as a verb but usually in the passive sense.
"The general's visit this week-end went well until it snafued.
Everything went wrong after that."
"The general's visit this week-end went well until we snafued it."
