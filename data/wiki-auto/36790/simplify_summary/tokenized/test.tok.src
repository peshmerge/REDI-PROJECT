[CLS] an artery ( plural arteries ) ( from gr ##e " " α ##ρ ##τ ##η ##ρ ##ια " ( arte ##ria ) " , meaning ' wind ##pipe , artery ' ) is a blood vessel that takes blood away from the heart to all parts of the body ( tissues , lungs , etc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] most arteries carry oxygen ##ated blood ; the two exceptions are the pulmonary and the um ##bil ##ical arteries , which carry de ##ox ##y ##gen ##ated blood to the organs that oxygen ##ate it . [SEP]
[CLS] the effective arterial blood volume is that extra ##cellular fluid which fills the arterial system . [SEP]
[CLS] the arteries are part of the ci ##rc ##ulator ##y system , which is responsible for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to all cells , as well as the removal of carbon dioxide and waste products , the maintenance of opt ##imum blood ph , and the circulation of proteins and cells of the immune system . [SEP]
[CLS] the anatomy of arteries can be separated into gross anatomy , at the macro ##scopic level , and micro ##ana ##tom ##y , which must be studied with a microscope . [SEP]
[CLS] the arterial system of the human body is divided into systemic arteries , carrying blood from the heart to the whole body , and pulmonary arteries , carrying de ##ox ##y ##gen ##ated blood from the heart to the lungs . [SEP]
[CLS] the outer ##most layer of an artery ( or vein ) is known as the tunic ##a ex ##tern ##a , also known as " tunic ##a advent ##itia " , and is composed of col ##lage ##n fibers and elastic tissue - with the largest arteries containing va ##sa va ##sor ##um ( small blood vessels that supply large blood vessels ) . [SEP]
[CLS] most of the layers have a clear boundary between them , however the tunic ##a ex ##tern ##a has a boundary that is ill defined . [SEP]
[CLS] normally its boundary is considered when it meets or touches the connect ##ive tissue . [SEP]
[CLS] inside this layer is the tunic ##a media , or " media " , which is made up of smooth muscle cells , elastic tissue ( also called " connect ##ive tissue proper " ) and col ##lage ##n fibre ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the inner ##most layer , which is in direct contact with the flow of blood , is the tunic ##a int ##ima , commonly called the " int ##ima " . [SEP]
[CLS] the elastic tissue allows the artery to bend and fit through places in the body . [SEP]
[CLS] this layer is mainly made up of end ##oth ##elial cells ( and a supporting layer of el ##ast ##in rich col ##lage ##n in elastic arteries ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the hollow internal cavity in which the blood flows is called the lu ##men . [SEP]
[CLS] arterial formation begins and ends when end ##oth ##elial cells begin to express arterial specific genes , such as ep ##hri ##n b ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] arteries form part of the ci ##rc ##ulator ##y system . [SEP]
[CLS] they carry blood that is oxygen ##ated after it has been pumped from the heart . [SEP]
[CLS] corona ##ry arteries also aid the heart in pumping blood by sending oxygen ##ated blood to the heart , allowing the muscles to function . [SEP]
[CLS] arteries carry oxygen ##ated blood away from the heart to the tissues , except for pulmonary arteries , which carry blood to the lungs for oxygen ##ation ( usually veins carry de ##ox ##y ##gen ##ated blood to the heart but the pulmonary veins carry oxygen ##ated blood as well ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there are two types of unique arteries . [SEP]
[CLS] the pulmonary artery carries blood from the heart to the lungs , where it receives oxygen . [SEP]
[CLS] it is unique because the blood in it is not " oxygen ##ated " , as it has not yet passed through the lungs . [SEP]
[CLS] the other unique artery is the um ##bil ##ical artery , which carries de ##ox ##y ##gen ##ated blood from a fe ##tus to its mother . [SEP]
[CLS] arteries have a blood pressure higher than other parts of the ci ##rc ##ulator ##y system . [SEP]
[CLS] the pressure in arteries varies during the cardiac cycle . [SEP]
[CLS] it is highest when the heart contracts and lowest when heart relax ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] the variation in pressure produces a pulse , which can be felt in different areas of the body , such as the radial pulse . [SEP]
[CLS] arte ##rio ##les have the greatest collective influence on both local blood flow and on overall blood pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] they are the primary " adjustable no ##zzle ##s " in the blood system , across which the greatest pressure drop occurs . [SEP]
[CLS] the combination of heart output ( cardiac output ) and systemic vascular resistance , which refers to the collective resistance of all of the body ' s arte ##rio ##les , are the principal deter ##mina ##nts of arterial blood pressure at any given moment . [SEP]
[CLS] arteries have the highest pressure and have narrow lu ##men diameter . [SEP]
[CLS] it consists of the three tunic ##s : tunic ##a media , int ##ima and ex ##tern ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] systemic arteries are the arteries ( including the peripheral arteries ) , of the systemic circulation , which is the part of the cardiovascular system that carries oxygen ##ated blood away from the heart , to the body , and returns de ##ox ##y ##gen ##ated blood back to the heart . [SEP]
[CLS] systemic arteries can be subdivided into two types — muscular and elastic — according to the relative compositions of elastic and muscle tissue in their tunic ##a media as well as their size and the makeup of the internal and external elastic lam ##ina . [SEP]
[CLS] the larger arteries ( > 10 mm diameter ) are generally elastic and the smaller ones ( 0 . 1 – 10 mm ) tend to be muscular . [SEP]
[CLS] systemic arteries deliver blood to the arte ##rio ##les , and then to the cap ##illa ##ries , where nutrients and gases are exchanged . [SEP]
[CLS] after travelling from the ao ##rta , blood travels through peripheral arteries into smaller arteries called arte ##rio ##les , and eventually to cap ##illa ##ries . [SEP]
[CLS] arte ##rio ##les help in regulating blood pressure by the variable contraction of the smooth muscle of their walls , and deliver blood to the cap ##illa ##ries . [SEP]
[CLS] the ao ##rta is the root systemic artery ( i . e . , main artery ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in humans , it receives blood directly from the left vent ##ric ##le of the heart via the ao ##rti ##c valve . [SEP]
[CLS] as the ao ##rta branches , and these arteries branch in turn , they become successively smaller in diameter , down to the arte ##rio ##les . [SEP]
[CLS] the arte ##rio ##les supply cap ##illa ##ries , which in turn empty into ve ##nu ##les . [SEP]
[CLS] the very first branches off of the ao ##rta are the corona ##ry arteries , which supply blood to the heart muscle itself . [SEP]
[CLS] these are followed by the branches off the ao ##rti ##c arch , namely the bra ##chio ##ce ##pha ##lic artery , the left common car ##ot ##id , and the left sub ##cl ##avian arteries . [SEP]
[CLS] the cap ##illa ##ries are the smallest of the blood vessels and are part of the micro ##ci ##rc ##ulation . [SEP]
[CLS] the micro ##ves ##sel ##s have a width of a single cell in diameter to aid in the fast and easy diffusion of gases , sugar ##s and nutrients to surrounding tissues . [SEP]
[CLS] cap ##illa ##ries have no smooth muscle surrounding them and have a diameter less than that of red blood cells ; a red blood cell is typically 7 micro ##meter ##s outside diameter , cap ##illa ##ries typically 5 micro ##meter ##s inside diameter . [SEP]
[CLS] the red blood cells must di ##stor ##t in order to pass through the cap ##illa ##ries . [SEP]
[CLS] these small diameter ##s of the cap ##illa ##ries provide a relatively large surface area for the exchange of gases and nutrients . [SEP]
[CLS] systemic arterial pressures are generated by the forceful contraction ##s of the heart ' s left vent ##ric ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] high blood pressure is a factor in causing arterial damage . [SEP]
[CLS] healthy resting arterial pressures are relatively low , mean systemic pressures typically being under above surrounding atmospheric pressure ( about at sea level ) . [SEP]
[CLS] to withstand and adapt to the pressures within , arteries are surrounded by varying thickness ##es of smooth muscle which have extensive elastic and in ##ela ##stic connect ##ive tissues . [SEP]
[CLS] the pulse pressure , being the difference between sy ##sto ##lic and dia ##sto ##lic pressure , is determined primarily by the amount of blood ejected by each heart beat , stroke volume , versus the volume and elastic ##ity of the major arteries . [SEP]
[CLS] a blood sq ##ui ##rt also known as an arterial gus ##h is the effect when an artery is cut due to the higher arterial pressures . [SEP]
[CLS] blood is spur ##ted out at a rapid , intermittent rate , that coincide ##s with the heartbeat . [SEP]
[CLS] the amount of blood loss can be cop ##ious , can occur very rapidly , and be life - threatening . [SEP]
[CLS] over time , factors such as elevated arterial blood sugar ( particularly as seen in diabetes mel ##lit ##us ) , lip ##op ##rot ##ein , cho ##les ##terol , high blood pressure , stress and smoking , are all implicated in damaging both the end ##oth ##eli ##um and walls of the arteries , resulting in at ##her ##os ##cle ##rosis . [SEP]
[CLS] at ##her ##os ##cle ##rosis is a disease marked by the harden ##ing of arteries . [SEP]
[CLS] this is caused by an at ##her ##oma or plaque in the artery wall and is a build - up of cell debris , that contain lip ##ids , ( cho ##les ##terol and fatty acids ) , calcium and a variable amount of fi ##bro ##us connect ##ive tissue . [SEP]
[CLS] accidental intra ##arte ##rial injection either ia ##tro ##genic ##ally or through recreational drug use can cause symptoms such as intense pain , par ##esthesia and nec ##rosis . [SEP]
[CLS] it usually causes permanent damage to the limb ; often amp ##utation is necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] among the ancient greeks , the arteries were considered to be " air holders " that were responsible for the transport of air to the tissues and were connected to the tr ##ache ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] this was as a result of finding the arteries of cad ##aver ##s devoid of blood . [SEP]
[CLS] in medieval times , it was recognized that arteries carried a fluid , called " spiritual blood " or " vital spirits " , considered to be different from the contents of the veins . [SEP]
[CLS] this theory went back to galen . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late medieval period , the tr ##ache ##a , and ligament ##s were also called " arteries " . [SEP]
[CLS] william harvey described and popularized the modern concept of the ci ##rc ##ulator ##y system and the roles of arteries and veins in the 17th century . [SEP]
[CLS] alexis carr ##el at the beginning of the 20th century first described the technique for vascular su ##turing and ana ##sto ##mos ##is and successfully performed many organ transplant ##ations in animals ; he thus actually opened the way to modern vascular surgery that was previously limited to vessels ’ permanent liga ##tion . [SEP]
[CLS] theodor koch ##er reported that at ##her ##os ##cle ##rosis often developed in patients who had undergone a thyroid ##ect ##omy and suggested that h ##yp ##oth ##yr ##oid ##ism favors at ##her ##os ##cle ##rosis , which was , in 1900s auto ##ps ##ies , seen more frequently in io ##dine - def ##icient austrians compared to iceland ##ers , who are not def ##icient in io ##dine . [SEP]
[CLS] turner reported the effectiveness of io ##di ##de and dried extracts of thyroid in the prevention of at ##her ##os ##cle ##rosis in laboratory rabbits . [SEP]
