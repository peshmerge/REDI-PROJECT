[CLS] gerard adams ( ; born 6 october 1948 ) is an irish republican politician who was the leader of the sinn fein political party between 13 november 1983 and 10 february 2018 , and has been a teach ##ta dal ##a ( td ) for lou ##th since the 2011 general election . [SEP]
[CLS] from the late 1980s onwards , adams was an important figure in the northern ireland peace process , initially following contact by the then - social democratic and labour party ( sd ##lp ) leader john hume and then subsequently with the irish and british governments . [SEP]
[CLS] under adams , sinn fein changed its traditional policy of abs ##ten ##tion ##ism towards the o ##ire ##ach ##tas , the parliament of the republic of ireland , in 1986 and later took seats in the power - sharing northern ireland assembly . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2014 , he was held for four days by the police service of northern ireland for questioning in connection with the abduction and murder of jean mcc ##on ##ville in 1972 . [SEP]
[CLS] adams announced in november 2017 that he would step down as leader of sinn fein in 2018 , and that he would not stand for re - election to his seat in the dail in the next election . [SEP]
[CLS] he was succeeded as leader of sinn fein by mary lou mcdonald at a special ar ##df ##hei ##s ( party conference ) on 10 february 2018 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1942 , he participated in an ira ambush on a royal ulster constabulary ( ru ##c ) patrol but was himself shot , arrested and sentenced to eight years imprisonment . [SEP]
[CLS] having passed the eleven - plus exam in 1960 , he attended st mary ' s christian brothers grammar school . [SEP]
[CLS] he was increasingly involved in the irish republican movement , joining sinn fein and fia ##nna eireann in 1964 , after being radical ##ised by the di ##vis street riots during that year ' s general election campaign . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1971 , adams married col ##lette mca ##rd ##le , with whom he has one son , gear ##oid ( born 1973 ) , who has played gaelic football for antrim gaa senior men ' s team and was its assistant manager in 2012 . [SEP]
[CLS] adams was active in riot ##ing at this time and later became involved in the republican movement . [SEP]
[CLS] adams was interned in march 1972 , on , but on the provisional ira ' s insistence was released in june to take part in secret , but ab ##ort ##ive talks in london . [SEP]
[CLS] the ira negotiated a short - lived truce with the british government and an ira delegation met with british home secretary william white ##law at che ##yne walk in chelsea . [SEP]
[CLS] adams was re - arrested in july 1973 and interned at the long ke ##sh internment camp . [SEP]
[CLS] during this time , he wrote articles in the paper " an ph ##ob ##la ##cht " under the by - line " brown ##ie " , where he criticised the strategy and policy of sinn fein president ru ##air ##i o brad ##ai ##gh and ira belfast o ##c billy mc ##kee . [SEP]
[CLS] he was also highly critical of a decision taken by mc ##kee to assassinate members of the rival official ira , who had been on ceasefire since 1972 . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1981 hunger strike , which saw the emergence of his party as a political force , adams played an important policy - making role . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1983 , he was elected president of sinn fein and became the first sinn fein mp elected to the british house of commons since phil clarke and tom mitchell in the mid - 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] following his election as mp for belfast west , the british government lifted a ban on his travelling to great britain . [SEP]
[CLS] sinn fein retains a policy of abs ##ten ##tion ##ism towards the westminster parliament , but since 2002 , has received allowance ##s for staff and takes up offices in the house of commons . [SEP]
[CLS] on 14 march 1984 in central belfast , adams was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt when several ulster defence association ( ud ##a ) gunmen fired about 20 shots into the car in which he was travelling . [SEP]
[CLS] the attack had been known in advance by security forces due to a tip - off from informant ##s within rat ##hc ##ool ##e ; adams and his co - passengers had survived in part because royal ulster constabulary officers , acting on the informant ##s ' information , had replaced much of the ammunition in the ud ##a ' s rat ##hc ##ool ##e weapons dump with low - velocity bullets . [SEP]
[CLS] however , authors such as ed mo ##lone ##y , peter taylor , mark urban and historian richard english have all named adams as part of the ira leadership since the 1970s . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##lone ##y and taylor state adams became the ira ' s chief of staff following the arrest of seamus two ##me ##y in early december 1977 , remaining in the position until 18 february 1978 when he , along with twenty other republican suspects , was arrested following the la mon restaurant bombing . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##lone ##y and english state adams had been a member of the ira army council since 1977 , remaining a member until 2005 according to irish minister for justice , equality and law reform michael mcdowell [SEP]
[CLS] on 30 april 2014 , adams was arrested by detectives from the police service of northern ireland ( ps ##ni ) serious crime branch , under the terrorism act 2000 , in connection with the murder of jean mcc ##on ##ville in 1972 . [SEP]
[CLS] he had previously voluntarily arranged to be interviewed by police regarding the matter , and maintained he had no involvement . [SEP]
[CLS] jean mcc ##on ##ville ' s son michael said that his family did not think the arrest of adams would ever happen , but were " quite glad " that the arrest took place . [SEP]
[CLS] at a press conference after his release , adams also criticised the timing of his arrest , while rei ##tera ##ting sinn fein ' s support for the ps ##ni and saying : " the ira is gone . [SEP]
[CLS] adams has denied that he had any involvement in the murder or was ever a member of the ira , and has said the allegations against him came from " enemies of the peace process " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1978 , gerry adams became joint vice - president of sinn fein and a key figure in directing a challenge to the sinn fein leadership of president ru ##air ##i o brad ##ai ##gh and joint vice - president dai ##thi o con ##ail ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1975 ira - british truce is often viewed as the event that began the challenge to the original provisional sinn fein leadership , which was dominated by southern ##ers like o brad ##ai ##gh and o con ##ail ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the reasons that the provisional ira and provisional sinn fein were founded , in december 1969 and january 1970 , respectively , was that people like o brad ##ai ##gh , o ' connell and mc ##kee opposed participation in constitutional politics . [SEP]
[CLS] the other reason was the failure of the cat ##hal gould ##ing leadership to provide for the defence of irish nationalist areas during the 1969 northern ireland riots . [SEP]
[CLS] when , at the december 1969 ira convention and the january 1970 sinn fein ar ##d f ##hei ##s , the delegates voted to participate in the dublin ( leinster house ) , belfast ( storm ##ont ) and london ( westminster ) parliament ##s , the organisations split . [SEP]
[CLS] the call res ##onate ##d with younger northern people , many of whom had been active in the provisional ira but few of whom had been active in sinn fein . [SEP]
[CLS] the address was viewed as watershed in that drum ##m acknowledged that the war would be a long one and that success depended on political activity that would complement the ira ' s armed campaign . [SEP]
[CLS] for some , this wedding of politics and armed struggle culminated in danny morrison ' s statement at the 1981 sinn fein ar ##d f ##hei ##s in which he asked " who here really believes we can win the war through the ballot box ? [SEP]
[CLS] but will anyone here object if , with a ballot paper in one hand and the arm ##ali ##te in the other , we take power in ireland ? " [SEP]
[CLS] for others , however , the call to link political activity with armed struggle had already been defined in sinn fein policy and in the presidential addresses of ru ##air ##i o brad ##ai ##gh , but this had not res ##onate ##d with young northern ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] even after the election of bobby sands as mp for fe ##rman ##agh and south tyrone , a part of the mass mob ##ilis ##ation associated with the 1981 irish hunger strike by republican prisoners in the h blocks of the maze prison ( known as long ke ##sh by republicans ) , adams was cautious that the level of political involvement by sinn fein could lead to electoral embarrassment . [SEP]
[CLS] at an ar ##d cho ##m ##hair ##le meeting , adams recommended that they contest only four constituencies which were in border counties . [SEP]
[CLS] this , along with the election of sands , was a precursor to an electoral breakthrough in elections in 1982 to the 1982 northern ireland assembly . [SEP]
[CLS] the social democratic and labour party ( sd ##lp ) had announced before the election that it would not take any seats and so its 14 elected representatives also abs ##tained from participating in the assembly and it was a failure . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1982 election was followed by the 1983 westminster election , in which sinn fein ' s vote increased and gerry adams was elected , as an abs ##ten ##tion ##ist , as mp for belfast west . [SEP]
[CLS] many republicans had long claimed that the only legitimate irish state was the irish republic declared in the proclamation of the republic of 1916 . [SEP]
[CLS] in their view , the legitimate government was the ira army council , which had been vested with the authority of that republic in 1938 ( prior to the second world war ) by the last remaining anti - treaty deputies of the second dail . [SEP]
[CLS] in his 2005 speech to the sinn fein ar ##d f ##hei ##s in dublin , adams explicitly rejected this view . [SEP]
[CLS] we do not believe that the army council is the government of ireland . [SEP]
[CLS] at its 1986 ar ##d f ##hei ##s , sinn fein delegates passed a resolution to amend the rules and constitution that would allow its members to sit in the dublin parliament ( leinster house ) . [SEP]
[CLS] at this , ru ##air ##i o brad ##ai ##gh led a small walk ##out , just as he and sean mac st ##io ##fa ##in had done sixteen years earlier with the creation of provisional sinn fein . [SEP]
[CLS] adams ' leadership of sinn fein was supported by a northern - based cad ##re that included people like danny morrison and martin mc ##gui ##nne ##ss . [SEP]
[CLS] over time , adams and others pointed to republican electoral successes in the early and mid - 1980s , when hunger strikers bobby sands and ki ##eran doherty were elected to the british house of commons and dail eireann respectively , and they advocated that sinn fein become increasingly political and base its influence on electoral politics rather than para ##mi ##lita ##ris ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] the electoral effects of this strategy were shown later by the election of adams and mc ##gui ##nne ##ss to the house of commons . [SEP]
[CLS] thatcher was moved to act after bbc interviews of martin mc ##gui ##nne ##ss and adams had been the focus of a row over an edition of " after dark " , a proposed channel 4 discussion programme which in the event was never made . [SEP]
[CLS] while the ban covered 11 irish political parties and paramilitary organisations , in practice it mostly affected sinn fein , the most prominent of these bodies . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar ban , known as section 31 , had been law in the republic of ireland since the 1970s . [SEP]
[CLS] in the uk , this was initially by the use of sub ##titles , but later and more often by an actor reading words accompanied by video footage of the banned person speaking . [SEP]
[CLS] these ban ##s were lamp ##oon ##ed in cartoons and satirical tv shows , such as " spitting image " , and in " the day today " , and were criticised by freedom of speech organisations and media personalities , including bbc director general john bi ##rt and bbc foreign editor john simpson . [SEP]
[CLS] he lost his seat to joe hen ##dron of the social democratic and labour party ( sd ##lp ) in the 1992 general election , regaining it at the following 1997 election . [SEP]
[CLS] under adams , sinn fein moved away from being a political voice of the provisional ira to becoming a professionally organised political party in both northern ireland and the republic of ireland . [SEP]
[CLS] these discussions led to unofficial contacts with the british northern ireland office under the secretary of state for northern ireland , peter brooke , and with the government of the republic under charles ha ##ugh ##ey – although both governments maintained in public that they would not negotiate with terrorists . [SEP]
[CLS] these talks provided the ground ##work for what was later to be the belfast agreement , preceded by the milestone downing street declaration and the joint framework document . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the slow pace of developments contributed in part to the ( wider ) political difficulties of the british government of john major . [SEP]
[CLS] his con ##se ##quent reliance on ulster unionist party votes in the house of commons led to him agreeing with the u ##up demand to exclude sinn fein from talks until the ira had decommissioned . [SEP]
[CLS] after the 1997 united kingdom general election , the new labour government had a majority in the house of commons and was not re ##lian ##t on unionist votes . [SEP]
[CLS] the subsequent dropping of the insistence led to another ira ceasefire , as part of the negotiations strategy , which saw teams from the british and irish governments , the u ##up , the sd ##lp , sinn fein and representatives of loyalist paramilitary organisations , under the chairman ##ship of former united states senator george mitchell , produce the belfast agreement ( also called the " good friday agreement " as it was signed on good friday , 1998 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] under the agreement , structures were created reflecting the irish and british identities of the people of ireland , creating a british - irish council and a northern ireland legislative assembly . [SEP]
[CLS] as part of their deal , sinn fein agreed to abandon its abs ##ten ##tion ##ist policy regarding a " six - county parliament " , as a result taking seats in the new storm ##ont - based assembly and running the education and health and social services ministries in the power - sharing government . [SEP]
[CLS] however , adams insisted that the belfast agreement provided a mechanism to deliver a united ireland by non - violent and constitutional means . [SEP]
[CLS] when sinn fein came to nominate its two ministers to the northern ireland executive , for tactical reasons the party , like the sd ##lp and the du ##p , chose not to include its leader among its ministers . [SEP]
[CLS] when later the sd ##lp chose a new leader , it selected one of its ministers , mark du ##rka ##n , who then opted to remain in the committee . [SEP]
[CLS] adams was re - elected to the northern ireland assembly on 8 march 2007 , and on 26 march 2007 , he met with du ##p leader ian paisley face - to - face for the first time . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2011 , the chancellor of the exchequer appointed adams to the british title of steward and bail ##iff of the manor of north ##stead to allow him to resign from the house of commons and to stand for election to dail eireann . [SEP]
[CLS] initially it was claimed by david cameron that adams had accepted the title but downing street has since ap ##olo ##gis ##ed for this and adams has publicly rejected the title stating , " i have had no truck whatsoever with these anti ##qua ##ted and quite bizarre aspects of the british parliamentary system " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2010 , adams announced that he would be seeking election as a td ( member of irish parliament ) for the constituency of lou ##th at the 2011 irish general election . [SEP]
[CLS] following the announcement of the 2011 irish general election , adams wrote to the house of commons to resign his seat . [SEP]
[CLS] this was treated as an application for the position of crown steward and bail ##iff of the manor of north ##stead , an office of profit under the crown , the traditional method of leaving westminster as plain resignation is not possible , and granted as such even though adams had not explicitly made the request . [SEP]
[CLS] in september 2017 , adams said he will allow his name to go forward for a one - year term as president of sinn fein at the november ar ##df ##hei ##s , at which point sinn fein would begin a " planned process of generation ##al change , including adams ' own future intentions " . [SEP]
[CLS] this has resulted in speculation in the irish and british media that adams is preparing to stand down as party leader , and that he may run for president of ireland in the next election . [SEP]
[CLS] at the ar ##df ##hei ##s on 18 november , adams was re - elected for another year as party president , but announced that he would step down at some point in 2018 , and would not seek re - election as td for lou ##th . [SEP]
[CLS] adams leadership of sinn fein ended on 10 february 2018 , with his stepping down , and the election of mary lou mcdonald as the party ' s new president . [SEP]
[CLS] adams escaped injury and claimed that his two grandchildren were standing in the driveway only ten minutes before the blast . [SEP]
[CLS] in a press conference the following day , adams said he thought the attacks were linked to the riots in derry , and asked that those responsible " come and sit down " and " give us the rational ##e for this action " . [SEP]
[CLS] in october 2013 liam adams , gerry adams ' brother , was found guilty of ten offences , including rape and gross ind ##ece ##ncy committed against his daughter , ain ##e adams . [SEP]
[CLS] following the conviction of liam adams , the attorney general of northern ireland , john larkin , has been asked to review a 2011 decision not to prose ##cute gerry adams over an all ##ega ##tion that he with ##held information in connection with the case . [SEP]
[CLS] a statement from the d ##pp read : " the director of public prosecution ##s , barr ##a mc ##gr ##ory qc , recognise ##s that there has been considerable public interest surrounding the decision not to prose ##cute mr . gerry adams in october 2011 in relation to an all ##ega ##tion that he with ##held information in connection with the liam adams case . [SEP]
[CLS] in a statement issued in response , adams said : " with hind ##sight there are things i could have done differently , but i ' m not on trial here . [SEP]
[CLS] the t ##wee ##t was not well received and was deleted , with adams ap ##olo ##gis ##ing for the use of " ni ##gger " the next day at sinn fein ' s connolly house head ##qua ##rter in belfast . [SEP]
[CLS] adams ' s use of the sl ##ur in the t ##wee ##t was widely reported in irish , british and american media . [SEP]
[CLS] adams stood over the t ##wee ##t stating : " i stand over the context and main point of my t ##wee ##t , which were the parallels between people in struggle . [SEP]
[CLS] i have long been inspired by harriet tub ##man , frederick douglass , rosa parks , martin luther king and malcolm x , who stood up for themselves and for justice . " [SEP]
[CLS] he also stated : " i was parallel ##ing the experiences of the irish , not just in recent times but through the penal days when the irish were sold as slaves , through the cromwell ##ian period " , and that 50 , 000 irish were shipped as slaves to barbados between 1652 and 1659 . [SEP]
