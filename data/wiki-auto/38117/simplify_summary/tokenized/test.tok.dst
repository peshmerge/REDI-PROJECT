[CLS] gerard adams ( ; born 6 october 1948 ) is an irish republican politician who was the leader of the sinn fein political party between 13 november 1983 and 10 february 2018 , and has been a teach ##ta dal ##a ( td ) for lou ##th since the 2011 general election . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1983 to 1992 and from 1997 to 2011 , he was an abs ##ten ##tion ##ist member of parliament ( mp ) of the british parliament for the belfast west constituency . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1984 , adams was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt by several gunmen from the ulster defence association ( ud ##a ) , including john gregg . [SEP]
[CLS] from the late 1980s onwards , adams was an important figure in the northern ireland peace process , initially following contact by the then - social democratic and labour party ( sd ##lp ) leader john hume and then subsequently with the irish and british governments . [SEP]
[CLS] under adams , sinn fein changed its traditional policy of abs ##ten ##tion ##ism towards the o ##ire ##ach ##tas , the parliament of the republic of ireland , in 1986 and later took seats in the power - sharing northern ireland assembly . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2005 , the provisional irish republican army ( ira ) stated that its armed campaign was over and that it was exclusively committed to peaceful politics . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2014 , he was held for four days by the police service of northern ireland for questioning in connection with the abduction and murder of jean mcc ##on ##ville in 1972 . [SEP]
[CLS] he was freed without charge and a file was sent to the public prosecution service , which later stated there was insufficient evidence to charge him , as had been expected since shortly after his release . [SEP]
[CLS] adams announced in november 2017 that he would step down as leader of sinn fein in 2018 , and that he would not stand for re - election to his seat in the dail in the next election . [SEP]
[CLS] he was succeeded as leader of sinn fein by mary lou mcdonald at a special ar ##df ##hei ##s ( party conference ) on 10 february 2018 . [SEP]
[CLS] adams was born in belfast , northern ireland . [SEP]
[CLS] his parents , anne ( hanna ##way ) and gerry adams sr . , came from republican backgrounds . [SEP]
[CLS] his grandfather , also named gerry adams , was a member of the irish republican brotherhood ( ir ##b ) during the irish war of independence . [SEP]
[CLS] two of adams ' s uncles , dominic and patrick adams , had been interned by the governments in belfast and dublin . [SEP]
[CLS] j . bow ##yer bell states in his book , " the secret army " , that dominic adams was a senior figure in the ira of the mid - 1940s . [SEP]
[CLS] gerry adams sr . joined the ira at age sixteen . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1942 , he participated in an ira ambush on a royal ulster constabulary ( ru ##c ) patrol but was himself shot , arrested and sentenced to eight years imprisonment . [SEP]
[CLS] adams ' s maternal great - grandfather , michael hanna ##way , was also a member of the ir ##b during its d ##yna ##mit ##ing campaign in england in the 1860s and 1870s . [SEP]
[CLS] michael ' s son , billy , was election agent for ea ##mon de vale ##ra at the 1918 irish general election in west belfast . [SEP]
[CLS] adams attended st fin ##ian ' s primary school on the falls road , where he was taught by la salle brothers . [SEP]
[CLS] having passed the eleven - plus exam in 1960 , he attended st mary ' s christian brothers grammar school . [SEP]
[CLS] he left st mary ' s with six o - levels and became a bar ##man . [SEP]
[CLS] he was increasingly involved in the irish republican movement , joining sinn fein and fia ##nna eireann in 1964 , after being radical ##ised by the di ##vis street riots during that year ' s general election campaign . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1971 , adams married col ##lette mca ##rd ##le , with whom he has one son , gear ##oid ( born 1973 ) , who has played gaelic football for antrim gaa senior men ' s team and was its assistant manager in 2012 . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late 1960s , a civil rights campaign developed in northern ireland . [SEP]
[CLS] adams was an active supporter and joined the northern ireland civil rights association in 1967 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the civil rights movement was met with violence from loyalist counter - demonstrations and the royal ulster constabulary . [SEP]
[CLS] in august 1969 , northern ireland cities like belfast and derry erupted in major riot ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] british troops were called in at the request of the government of northern ireland ( see 1969 northern ireland riots ) . [SEP]
[CLS] adams was active in riot ##ing at this time and later became involved in the republican movement . [SEP]
[CLS] in august 1971 , internment was reintroduced to northern ireland under the special powers act 1922 . [SEP]
[CLS] adams was interned in march 1972 , on , but on the provisional ira ' s insistence was released in june to take part in secret , but ab ##ort ##ive talks in london . [SEP]
[CLS] the ira negotiated a short - lived truce with the british government and an ira delegation met with british home secretary william white ##law at che ##yne walk in chelsea . [SEP]
[CLS] the delegation included adams , martin mc ##gui ##nne ##ss , sean mac st ##io ##fa ##in ( ira chief of staff ) , dai ##thi o ' con ##ail ##l , seamus two ##me ##y , ivo ##r bell and dublin solicitor myles she ##v ##lin . [SEP]
[CLS] adams was re - arrested in july 1973 and interned at the long ke ##sh internment camp . [SEP]
[CLS] after taking part in an ira - organised escape attempt , he was sentenced to a period of imprisonment . [SEP]
[CLS] during this time , he wrote articles in the paper " an ph ##ob ##la ##cht " under the by - line " brown ##ie " , where he criticised the strategy and policy of sinn fein president ru ##air ##i o brad ##ai ##gh and ira belfast o ##c billy mc ##kee . [SEP]
[CLS] he was also highly critical of a decision taken by mc ##kee to assassinate members of the rival official ira , who had been on ceasefire since 1972 . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1981 hunger strike , which saw the emergence of his party as a political force , adams played an important policy - making role . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1983 , he was elected president of sinn fein and became the first sinn fein mp elected to the british house of commons since phil clarke and tom mitchell in the mid - 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] following his election as mp for belfast west , the british government lifted a ban on his travelling to great britain . [SEP]
[CLS] in line with sinn fein policy , he refused to take his seat in the house of commons . [SEP]
[CLS] sinn fein retains a policy of abs ##ten ##tion ##ism towards the westminster parliament , but since 2002 , has received allowance ##s for staff and takes up offices in the house of commons . [SEP]
[CLS] on 14 march 1984 in central belfast , adams was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt when several ulster defence association ( ud ##a ) gunmen fired about 20 shots into the car in which he was travelling . [SEP]
[CLS] he was hit in the neck , shoulder and arm . [SEP]
[CLS] he was rushed to the royal victoria hospital , where he underwent surgery to remove three bullets . [SEP]
[CLS] john gregg and his team were app ##re ##hend ##ed almost immediately by a british army patrol that opened fire on them before ram ##ming their car . [SEP]
[CLS] the attack had been known in advance by security forces due to a tip - off from informant ##s within rat ##hc ##ool ##e ; adams and his co - passengers had survived in part because royal ulster constabulary officers , acting on the informant ##s ' information , had replaced much of the ammunition in the ud ##a ' s rat ##hc ##ool ##e weapons dump with low - velocity bullets . [SEP]
[CLS] an ulster defence regiment nc ##o subsequently received the queen ' s gallantry medal for chasing and arresting an ass ##ail ##ant . [SEP]
[CLS] adams has stated repeatedly that he has never been a member of the provisional irish republican army ( ira ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , authors such as ed mo ##lone ##y , peter taylor , mark urban and historian richard english have all named adams as part of the ira leadership since the 1970s . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##lone ##y and taylor state adams became the ira ' s chief of staff following the arrest of seamus two ##me ##y in early december 1977 , remaining in the position until 18 february 1978 when he , along with twenty other republican suspects , was arrested following the la mon restaurant bombing . [SEP]
[CLS] he was charged with ira membership and re ##man ##ded to cr ##um ##lin road gao ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] he was released seven months later when the lord chief justice of northern ireland robert lowry ruled there was insufficient evidence to proceed with the prosecution . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##lone ##y and english state adams had been a member of the ira army council since 1977 , remaining a member until 2005 according to irish minister for justice , equality and law reform michael mcdowell [SEP]
[CLS] on 30 april 2014 , adams was arrested by detectives from the police service of northern ireland ( ps ##ni ) serious crime branch , under the terrorism act 2000 , in connection with the murder of jean mcc ##on ##ville in 1972 . [SEP]
[CLS] he had previously voluntarily arranged to be interviewed by police regarding the matter , and maintained he had no involvement . [SEP]
[CLS] fellow sinn fein politician alex mask ##ey claimed that the timing of the arrest , " three weeks into an election " , was evidence of a " political agenda . . . a negative agenda " by the ps ##ni . [SEP]
[CLS] jean mcc ##on ##ville ' s family had campaigned for the arrest of adams over the murder . [SEP]
[CLS] jean mcc ##on ##ville ' s son michael said that his family did not think the arrest of adams would ever happen , but were " quite glad " that the arrest took place . [SEP]
[CLS] adams was released without charge after four days in custody and it was decided to send a file to the public prosecution service , which would decide if criminal charges should be brought . [SEP]
[CLS] at a press conference after his release , adams also criticised the timing of his arrest , while rei ##tera ##ting sinn fein ' s support for the ps ##ni and saying : " the ira is gone . [SEP]
[CLS] adams has denied that he had any involvement in the murder or was ever a member of the ira , and has said the allegations against him came from " enemies of the peace process " . [SEP]
[CLS] on 29 september 2015 the public prosecution service announced adams would not face charges , due to insufficient evidence , as had been expected ever since a bbc report dated 6 may 2014 ( 2 days after the bbc reported his release ) , which was widely repeated elsewhere . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1978 , gerry adams became joint vice - president of sinn fein and a key figure in directing a challenge to the sinn fein leadership of president ru ##air ##i o brad ##ai ##gh and joint vice - president dai ##thi o con ##ail ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1975 ira - british truce is often viewed as the event that began the challenge to the original provisional sinn fein leadership , which was dominated by southern ##ers like o brad ##ai ##gh and o con ##ail ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the reasons that the provisional ira and provisional sinn fein were founded , in december 1969 and january 1970 , respectively , was that people like o brad ##ai ##gh , o ' connell and mc ##kee opposed participation in constitutional politics . [SEP]
[CLS] the other reason was the failure of the cat ##hal gould ##ing leadership to provide for the defence of irish nationalist areas during the 1969 northern ireland riots . [SEP]
[CLS] when , at the december 1969 ira convention and the january 1970 sinn fein ar ##d f ##hei ##s , the delegates voted to participate in the dublin ( leinster house ) , belfast ( storm ##ont ) and london ( westminster ) parliament ##s , the organisations split . [SEP]
[CLS] adams , who had joined the republican movement in the early 1960s , sided with the provisional ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in long ke ##sh in the mid - 1970s , writing under the pseudonym " brown ##ie " in " republican news " , adams called for increased political activity among republicans , especially at local level . [SEP]
[CLS] the call res ##onate ##d with younger northern people , many of whom had been active in the provisional ira but few of whom had been active in sinn fein . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1977 , adams and danny morrison drafted the address of jimmy drum ##m at the annual wolfe tone commemoration at bo ##den ##stown . [SEP]
[CLS] the address was viewed as watershed in that drum ##m acknowledged that the war would be a long one and that success depended on political activity that would complement the ira ' s armed campaign . [SEP]
[CLS] for some , this wedding of politics and armed struggle culminated in danny morrison ' s statement at the 1981 sinn fein ar ##d f ##hei ##s in which he asked " who here really believes we can win the war through the ballot box ? [SEP]
[CLS] but will anyone here object if , with a ballot paper in one hand and the arm ##ali ##te in the other , we take power in ireland ? " [SEP]
[CLS] for others , however , the call to link political activity with armed struggle had already been defined in sinn fein policy and in the presidential addresses of ru ##air ##i o brad ##ai ##gh , but this had not res ##onate ##d with young northern ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] even after the election of bobby sands as mp for fe ##rman ##agh and south tyrone , a part of the mass mob ##ilis ##ation associated with the 1981 irish hunger strike by republican prisoners in the h blocks of the maze prison ( known as long ke ##sh by republicans ) , adams was cautious that the level of political involvement by sinn fein could lead to electoral embarrassment . [SEP]
[CLS] charles ha ##ugh ##ey , the tao ##ise ##ach of the republic of ireland , called an election for june 1981 . [SEP]
[CLS] at an ar ##d cho ##m ##hair ##le meeting , adams recommended that they contest only four constituencies which were in border counties . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , h - block / armagh candidates contested nine constituencies and elected two td ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this , along with the election of sands , was a precursor to an electoral breakthrough in elections in 1982 to the 1982 northern ireland assembly . [SEP]
[CLS] adams , danny morrison , martin mc ##gui ##nne ##ss , jim mca ##llis ##ter , and owen carr ##on were elected as abs ##ten ##tion ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] the social democratic and labour party ( sd ##lp ) had announced before the election that it would not take any seats and so its 14 elected representatives also abs ##tained from participating in the assembly and it was a failure . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1982 election was followed by the 1983 westminster election , in which sinn fein ' s vote increased and gerry adams was elected , as an abs ##ten ##tion ##ist , as mp for belfast west . [SEP]
[CLS] it was in 1983 that ru ##air ##i o brad ##ai ##gh resigned as president of sinn fein and was succeeded by gerry adams . [SEP]
[CLS] many republicans had long claimed that the only legitimate irish state was the irish republic declared in the proclamation of the republic of 1916 . [SEP]
[CLS] in their view , the legitimate government was the ira army council , which had been vested with the authority of that republic in 1938 ( prior to the second world war ) by the last remaining anti - treaty deputies of the second dail . [SEP]
[CLS] in his 2005 speech to the sinn fein ar ##d f ##hei ##s in dublin , adams explicitly rejected this view . [SEP]
[CLS] " but we refuse to criminal ##ise those who break the law in pursuit of legitimate political objectives . [SEP]
[CLS] . . . sinn fein is accused of rec ##og ##nis ##ing the army council of the ira as the legitimate government of this island . [SEP]
[CLS] that is not the case . [SEP]
[CLS] we do not believe that the army council is the government of ireland . [SEP]
[CLS] such a government will only exist when all the people of this island elect it . [SEP]
[CLS] does sinn fein accept the institutions of this state as the legitimate institutions of this state ? [SEP]
[CLS] of course we do . " [SEP]
[CLS] as a result of this non - recognition , sinn fein had abs ##tained from taking any of the seats they won in the british or irish parliament ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] at its 1986 ar ##d f ##hei ##s , sinn fein delegates passed a resolution to amend the rules and constitution that would allow its members to sit in the dublin parliament ( leinster house ) . [SEP]
[CLS] at this , ru ##air ##i o brad ##ai ##gh led a small walk ##out , just as he and sean mac st ##io ##fa ##in had done sixteen years earlier with the creation of provisional sinn fein . [SEP]
[CLS] this minority , which rejected dropping the policy of abs ##ten ##tion ##ism , now distinguishes itself from provisional sinn fein by using the name republican sinn fein ( or sinn fein po ##bla ##cht ##ach ) , and maintains that they are the true sinn fein . [SEP]
[CLS] adams ' leadership of sinn fein was supported by a northern - based cad ##re that included people like danny morrison and martin mc ##gui ##nne ##ss . [SEP]
[CLS] over time , adams and others pointed to republican electoral successes in the early and mid - 1980s , when hunger strikers bobby sands and ki ##eran doherty were elected to the british house of commons and dail eireann respectively , and they advocated that sinn fein become increasingly political and base its influence on electoral politics rather than para ##mi ##lita ##ris ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] the electoral effects of this strategy were shown later by the election of adams and mc ##gui ##nne ##ss to the house of commons . [SEP]
[CLS] adams ' s prominence as an irish republican leader was increased by the 1988 – 94 british broadcasting voice restrictions , which were imposed by british prime minister margaret thatcher to " star ##ve the terrorist and the hi ##jack ##er of the oxygen of publicity on which they depend " . [SEP]
[CLS] thatcher was moved to act after bbc interviews of martin mc ##gui ##nne ##ss and adams had been the focus of a row over an edition of " after dark " , a proposed channel 4 discussion programme which in the event was never made . [SEP]
[CLS] while the ban covered 11 irish political parties and paramilitary organisations , in practice it mostly affected sinn fein , the most prominent of these bodies . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar ban , known as section 31 , had been law in the republic of ireland since the 1970s . [SEP]
[CLS] however , media outlets soon found ways around the ban ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in the uk , this was initially by the use of sub ##titles , but later and more often by an actor reading words accompanied by video footage of the banned person speaking . [SEP]
[CLS] actors who voiced adams included stephen re ##a and paul lough ##ran . [SEP]
[CLS] this loop ##hole could not be used in the republic , as word - for - word broadcasts were not allowed . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , the banned speaker ' s words were sum ##mar ##ised by the news ##rea ##der , over video of them speaking . [SEP]
[CLS] these ban ##s were lamp ##oon ##ed in cartoons and satirical tv shows , such as " spitting image " , and in " the day today " , and were criticised by freedom of speech organisations and media personalities , including bbc director general john bi ##rt and bbc foreign editor john simpson . [SEP]
[CLS] the republic ' s ban was allowed to laps ##e in january 1994 , and the british ban was lifted by prime minister john major in september . [SEP]
[CLS] sinn fein continued its policy of refusing to sit in the westminster parliament after adams won the belfast west constituency . [SEP]
[CLS] he lost his seat to joe hen ##dron of the social democratic and labour party ( sd ##lp ) in the 1992 general election , regaining it at the following 1997 election . [SEP]
[CLS] under adams , sinn fein moved away from being a political voice of the provisional ira to becoming a professionally organised political party in both northern ireland and the republic of ireland . [SEP]
[CLS] sd ##lp leader john hume , mp , identified the possibility that a negotiated settlement might be possible and began secret talks with adams in 1988 . [SEP]
[CLS] these discussions led to unofficial contacts with the british northern ireland office under the secretary of state for northern ireland , peter brooke , and with the government of the republic under charles ha ##ugh ##ey – although both governments maintained in public that they would not negotiate with terrorists . [SEP]
[CLS] these talks provided the ground ##work for what was later to be the belfast agreement , preceded by the milestone downing street declaration and the joint framework document . [SEP]
[CLS] these negotiations led to the ira ceasefire in august 1994 . [SEP]
[CLS] tao ##ise ##ach albert reynolds , who had replaced ha ##ugh ##ey and who had played a key role in the hume / adams dialogue through his special advisor martin mans ##er ##gh , regarded the ceasefire as permanent . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the slow pace of developments contributed in part to the ( wider ) political difficulties of the british government of john major . [SEP]
[CLS] his con ##se ##quent reliance on ulster unionist party votes in the house of commons led to him agreeing with the u ##up demand to exclude sinn fein from talks until the ira had decommissioned . [SEP]
[CLS] sinn fein ' s exclusion led the ira to end its ceasefire and resume its campaign . [SEP]
[CLS] after the 1997 united kingdom general election , the new labour government had a majority in the house of commons and was not re ##lian ##t on unionist votes . [SEP]
[CLS] the subsequent dropping of the insistence led to another ira ceasefire , as part of the negotiations strategy , which saw teams from the british and irish governments , the u ##up , the sd ##lp , sinn fein and representatives of loyalist paramilitary organisations , under the chairman ##ship of former united states senator george mitchell , produce the belfast agreement ( also called the " good friday agreement " as it was signed on good friday , 1998 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] under the agreement , structures were created reflecting the irish and british identities of the people of ireland , creating a british - irish council and a northern ireland legislative assembly . [SEP]
[CLS] articles 2 and 3 of the republic ' s constitution , which claimed sovereignty over all of ireland , were re ##word ##ed , and a power - sharing executive committee was provided for . [SEP]
[CLS] as part of their deal , sinn fein agreed to abandon its abs ##ten ##tion ##ist policy regarding a " six - county parliament " , as a result taking seats in the new storm ##ont - based assembly and running the education and health and social services ministries in the power - sharing government . [SEP]
[CLS] on 15 august 1998 , four months after the signing of the good friday agreement , the real ira exploded a car bomb in om ##agh , county tyrone , killing 31 people and injuring 220 , from many communities . [SEP]
[CLS] breaking with tradition , adams said in reaction to the bombing " i am totally horrified by this action . [SEP]
[CLS] i condemn it without any e ##qui ##vocation whatsoever . " [SEP]
[CLS] prior to this , adams had maintained a policy of refusing to condemn ira or their splinter groups ' actions . [SEP]
[CLS] opponents in republican sinn fein accused sinn fein of " selling out " by agreeing to participate in what it called " partition ##ist assemblies " in the republic and northern ireland . [SEP]
[CLS] however , adams insisted that the belfast agreement provided a mechanism to deliver a united ireland by non - violent and constitutional means . [SEP]
[CLS] when sinn fein came to nominate its two ministers to the northern ireland executive , for tactical reasons the party , like the sd ##lp and the du ##p , chose not to include its leader among its ministers . [SEP]
[CLS] when later the sd ##lp chose a new leader , it selected one of its ministers , mark du ##rka ##n , who then opted to remain in the committee . [SEP]
[CLS] adams was re - elected to the northern ireland assembly on 8 march 2007 , and on 26 march 2007 , he met with du ##p leader ian paisley face - to - face for the first time . [SEP]
[CLS] these talks led to the st andrews agreement , which brought about the return of the power - sharing executive in northern ireland . [SEP]
[CLS] in january 2009 , adams attended the united states presidential inauguration of barack obama as a guest of us congressman richard neal . [SEP]
[CLS] on 6 may 2010 , adams was re - elected as mp for west belfast , garner ##ing 71 . 1 % of the vote . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2011 , the chancellor of the exchequer appointed adams to the british title of steward and bail ##iff of the manor of north ##stead to allow him to resign from the house of commons and to stand for election to dail eireann . [SEP]
[CLS] initially it was claimed by david cameron that adams had accepted the title but downing street has since ap ##olo ##gis ##ed for this and adams has publicly rejected the title stating , " i have had no truck whatsoever with these anti ##qua ##ted and quite bizarre aspects of the british parliamentary system " . [SEP]
[CLS] officially , adams held the title between january and april 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2011 he succeeded cao ##im ##hg ##hin o cao ##lain as sinn fein parliamentary leader in dail eireann . [SEP]
[CLS] on 19 may 2015 , while on an official royal trip to ireland , prince charles shook adams ' hand in what was described as a highly symbolic gesture of reconciliation . [SEP]
[CLS] the meeting , described as " historic " , took place in galway . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2010 , adams announced that he would be seeking election as a td ( member of irish parliament ) for the constituency of lou ##th at the 2011 irish general election . [SEP]
[CLS] he subsequently resigned his west belfast assembly seat on 7 december 2010 . [SEP]
[CLS] following the announcement of the 2011 irish general election , adams wrote to the house of commons to resign his seat . [SEP]
[CLS] this was treated as an application for the position of crown steward and bail ##iff of the manor of north ##stead , an office of profit under the crown , the traditional method of leaving westminster as plain resignation is not possible , and granted as such even though adams had not explicitly made the request . [SEP]
[CLS] he was elected to the dail , topping the lou ##th constituency poll with 15 , 07 ##2 ( 21 . 7 % ) first preference votes . [SEP]
[CLS] in september 2017 , adams said he will allow his name to go forward for a one - year term as president of sinn fein at the november ar ##df ##hei ##s , at which point sinn fein would begin a " planned process of generation ##al change , including adams ' own future intentions " . [SEP]
[CLS] this has resulted in speculation in the irish and british media that adams is preparing to stand down as party leader , and that he may run for president of ireland in the next election . [SEP]
[CLS] at the ar ##df ##hei ##s on 18 november , adams was re - elected for another year as party president , but announced that he would step down at some point in 2018 , and would not seek re - election as td for lou ##th . [SEP]
[CLS] adams leadership of sinn fein ended on 10 february 2018 , with his stepping down , and the election of mary lou mcdonald as the party ' s new president . [SEP]
[CLS] at 10 : 50 pm on 13 july 2018 , a home - made bomb was thrown at adams ' home in west belfast , damaging a car parked in his driveway . [SEP]
[CLS] adams escaped injury and claimed that his two grandchildren were standing in the driveway only ten minutes before the blast . [SEP]
[CLS] another bomb was set off that same evening at the nearby home of former ira volunteer and sinn fein official bobby storey . [SEP]
[CLS] in a press conference the following day , adams said he thought the attacks were linked to the riots in derry , and asked that those responsible " come and sit down " and " give us the rational ##e for this action " . [SEP]
[CLS] in october 2013 liam adams , gerry adams ' brother , was found guilty of ten offences , including rape and gross ind ##ece ##ncy committed against his daughter , ain ##e adams . [SEP]
[CLS] when the allegations of abuse were first made public in a 2009 ut ##v programme , gerry adams subsequently alleged that his deceased father , gerry adams sr . , had subjected family members to emotional , physical and sexual abuse . [SEP]
[CLS] on 27 november 2013 , liam adams was jailed for 16 years for rap ##ing and abu ##sing his daughter . [SEP]
[CLS] following the conviction of liam adams , the attorney general of northern ireland , john larkin , has been asked to review a 2011 decision not to prose ##cute gerry adams over an all ##ega ##tion that he with ##held information in connection with the case . [SEP]
[CLS] the request for the review has been made by northern ireland ' s director of public prosecution ##s , barr ##a mc ##gr ##ory . [SEP]
[CLS] a statement from the d ##pp read : " the director of public prosecution ##s , barr ##a mc ##gr ##ory qc , recognise ##s that there has been considerable public interest surrounding the decision not to prose ##cute mr . gerry adams in october 2011 in relation to an all ##ega ##tion that he with ##held information in connection with the liam adams case . [SEP]
[CLS] while the director has confidence in the evident ##ial decision taken by the pp ##s prior to his appointment , he has asked the attorney general to independently review the matter . [SEP]
[CLS] the attorney general will be given full access to all materials that he considers necessary to complete this review . " [SEP]
[CLS] in a statement issued in response , adams said : " with hind ##sight there are things i could have done differently , but i ' m not on trial here . [SEP]
[CLS] my brother was on trial . [SEP]
[CLS] ain ##e has been vin ##dicated . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a lot of healing that needs to be done . " [SEP]
[CLS] on 1 may 2016 , adams sparked controversy by t ##wee ##ting " watching " dj ##ango un ##chai ##ned " - a ball ##ym ##ur ##phy ni ##gger ! " [SEP]
[CLS] the t ##wee ##t was not well received and was deleted , with adams ap ##olo ##gis ##ing for the use of " ni ##gger " the next day at sinn fein ' s connolly house head ##qua ##rter in belfast . [SEP]
[CLS] adams ' s use of the sl ##ur in the t ##wee ##t was widely reported in irish , british and american media . [SEP]
[CLS] adams stood over the t ##wee ##t stating : " i stand over the context and main point of my t ##wee ##t , which were the parallels between people in struggle . [SEP]
[CLS] like african americans , irish nationalists were denied basic rights . [SEP]
[CLS] i have long been inspired by harriet tub ##man , frederick douglass , rosa parks , martin luther king and malcolm x , who stood up for themselves and for justice . " [SEP]
