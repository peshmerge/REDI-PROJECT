[CLS] communications included a notice that the previous ruler , an older brother , had died , and that bu had ascended to the throne . [SEP]
[CLS] the king ' bu ' in this document is believed to refer to emperor yu ##rya ##ku , due to the fact that the character used to write the name ( 武 ) is found in the name by which emperor yu ##rya ##ku was called during his lifetime : oh ##ats ##use wa ##kata ##ker ##u no mi ##koto ( 大 [UNK] 瀬 [UNK] 武 [UNK] ) .
