[CLS] the reign of emperor kin ##mei ( 50 ##9 – 57 ##1 ad ) , the 29th emperor , is the first for which contemporary his ##tori ##ography is able to assign ve ##ri ##fia ##ble dates ; however , the conventional ##ly accepted names and dates of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as " traditional " until the reign of emperor kan ##mu ( 737 – 80 ##6 ) , the 50th sovereign of the ya ##mat ##o dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] yu ##rya ##ku ' s contemporary title would not have been " ten ##no " , as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of emperor ten ##mu and empress ji ##to . [SEP]
[CLS] rather , it was presumably " sum ##era ##mi ##koto " or " am ##eno ##shi ##ta shi ##ros ##him ##es ##u ok ##imi " ( 治 天 下 大 王 ) , meaning " the great king who rules all under heaven " . [SEP]
[CLS] his successor , prince shi ##rak ##a ( emperor seine ##i ) , was his son by his wife ka ##zu ##rak ##i no kara ##him ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] in 46 ##3 , yu ##rya ##ku ten ##no invited the thunder god of the mi ##mur ##o hill to come to the imperial palace , and ordered chi ##isa ##ko ##be no mu ##raj ##i sugar ##u to fetch the deity . [SEP]
[CLS] he obliged , thinking the supernatural being would have no reason to refuse the invitation , and rode carrying a hal ##ber ##d with a red banner , symbol ##ising his office of royal messenger . [SEP]
[CLS] soon enough , the thunder stroke , and sugar ##u enlisted the help of priests to en ##sh ##rine the kam ##i into a portable carriage , to be brought in the emperor ' s presence , as a great serpent . [SEP]
[CLS] the thunder kam ##i then showed his displeasure through thunder ##ing and threatening fiery eye ##balls , and emperor yu ##rya ##ku fled into the interior of the palace while covering his eyes . [SEP]
[CLS] this story is recorded in ni ##hong ##i and mentioned by william george aston , in " shin ##to , the ancient religion of japan " as well as several other books . [SEP]
[CLS] the emperor is traditionally ve ##ner ##ated at a memorial shin ##to shrine ( " mis ##asa ##gi " ) in ha ##bi ##kin ##o , osaka , which is designated by the imperial household agency as yu ##rya ##ku ' s mausoleum . [SEP]
[CLS] communications included a notice that the previous ruler , an older brother , had died , and that bu had ascended to the throne . [SEP]
[CLS] the king ' bu ' in this document is believed to refer to emperor yu ##rya ##ku , due to the fact that the character used to write the name ( 武 ) is found in the name by which emperor yu ##rya ##ku was called during his lifetime : oh ##ats ##use wa ##kata ##ker ##u no mi ##koto ( 大 [UNK] 瀬 [UNK] 武 [UNK] ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the inscriptions on the ina ##ri ##yama and eta fun ##aya ##ma sword , also supports the idea that bu is an equivalent of emperor yu ##rya ##ku . [SEP]

[CLS] poems attributed to him are included in the " man ' yo ##shu " , and a number of his verses are preserved in the " ko ##ji ##ki " and the " ni ##hon ##sho ##ki " . [SEP]
