August (Aug.) is the 8th month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, coming between July and September.
It has 31 days, the same number of days as the previous month, July, and is named after Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar.
August doesn't begin on the same day of the week as any other month in common years, but begins on the same day of the week as February in leap years.
August always ends on the same day of the week as November.
This month was first called "Sextilis" in Latin, because it was the sixth month in the old Roman calendar.
The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with Romulus.
October was the eighth month.
August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700 BC.
Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree).
In 153 BC January 1 was determined as the beginning of the year.
August is named for Augustus Caesar who became Roman consul in this month.
The month has 31 days because Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 45 BC.
August is after July and before September.
August, in either hemisphere, is the seasonal equivalent of February in the other.
In the Northern hemisphere it is a summer month and it is a winter month in the Southern hemisphere.
No other month in common years begins on the same day of the week as August, but August begins on the same day of the week as February in leap years.
August ends on the same day of the week as November every year, as each other's last days are 13 weeks (91 days) apart.
