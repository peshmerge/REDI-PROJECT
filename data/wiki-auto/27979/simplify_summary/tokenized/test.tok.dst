[CLS] sunlight is a portion of the electromagnetic radiation given off by the sun , in particular infrared , visible , and ultraviolet light . [SEP]
[CLS] on earth , sunlight is filtered through earth ' s atmosphere , and is obvious as daylight when the sun is above the horizon . [SEP]
[CLS] when the direct solar radiation is not blocked by clouds , it is experienced as sunshine , a combination of bright light and radiant heat . [SEP]
[CLS] when it is blocked by clouds or reflects off other objects , it is experienced as diffuse ##d light . [SEP]
[CLS] the world meteorological organization uses the term " sunshine duration " to mean the cumulative time during which an area receives direct ir ##rad ##iance from the sun of at least 120 watts per square meter . [SEP]
[CLS] other sources indicate an " average over the entire earth " of " 164 watts per square meter over a 24 hour day " . [SEP]
[CLS] the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects , as it is both a re ##quisite for vitamin d synthesis and a mu ##tage ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] sunlight takes about 8 . 3 minutes to reach earth from the surface of the sun . [SEP]
[CLS] a photon starting at the center of the sun and changing direction every time it encounters a charged particle would take between 10 , 000 and 170 , 000 years to get to the surface . [SEP]
[CLS] sunlight is a key factor in photos ##yn ##thesis , the process used by plants and other auto ##tro ##phic organisms to convert light energy , normally from the sun , into chemical energy that can be used to synth ##es ##ize car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##tes and to fuel the organisms ' activities . [SEP]
[CLS] researchers can measure the intensity of sunlight using a sunshine recorder , p ##yra ##no ##meter , or p ##yr ##hel ##iom ##eter . [SEP]
[CLS] to calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground , both the eccentric ##ity of earth ' s elliptic orbit and the at ##ten ##uation by earth ' s atmosphere have to be taken into account . [SEP]
[CLS] the extra ##ter ##rest ##rial solar ill ##umi ##nan ##ce ( " e " ) , corrected for the elliptic orbit by using the day number of the year ( d ##n ) , is given to a good approximation by [SEP]
