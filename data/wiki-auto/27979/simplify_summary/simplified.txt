the sun is given off by the sun , in particular infrared , visible , and ultraviolet light .
on earth , sunlight is filtered through earth 's atmosphere , and is obvious as daylight when the sun is above the horizon .
when the direct solar radiation is blocked by clouds , it is experienced as sunshine .
when it is blocked by clouds or reflects off other objects , it is experienced as diffused light .
the world meteorological organization uses the term " sunshine duration " to mean the cumulative time during which an area receives direct irradiance from the sun of at least 120 watts per square meter .
other sources say an " average over the entire earth " of " 164 watts per square meter over a 24 hour day " .
the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects .
sunlight takes about 8.3 minutes to reach earth from the sun .
a photon starting at the center of the sun and changing direction every time it encounters a charged particle would take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to get to the surface .
the process is used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy .
researchers can measure the intensity of sunlight using a sunshine recorder , pyranometer , or pyrheliometer .
to calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground , both the eccentricity of earth 's elliptic orbit and the attenuation by earth 's atmosphere have to be taken into account .
the extraterrestrial solar illuminancetary , corrected for the elliptic orbit by using the day number of the year ¥ dənən specifies , is given to a good approximation by by by a good approximation by by by the perfect solar illuminancececececececececece centrial .
