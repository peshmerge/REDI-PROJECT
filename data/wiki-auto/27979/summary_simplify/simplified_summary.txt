when the direct solar radiation is blocked by clouds , it is experienced as sunshine .
the world meteorological organization uses the term " sunshine duration " to mean the cumulative time during which an area receives direct irradiance from the sun of at least 120 watts per square meter .
the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects .
a photon starting at the center of the sun and changing direction every time it encounters a charged particle would take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to get to the surface .
the process is used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy .
to calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground , both the eccentricity of earth 's elliptic orbit and the attenuation by earth 's atmosphere have to be taken into account .
the extraterrestrial solar illuminancetary , corrected for the elliptic orbit by using the day number of the year ¥ dənən specifies , is given to a good approximation by by by a good approximation by by by the perfect solar illuminancececececececececece centrial .
