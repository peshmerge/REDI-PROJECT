[CLS] the pennsylvania ##n ( also known as upper carbon ##iferous or late carbon ##iferous ) is , in the ic ##s geologic times ##cal ##e , the younger of two sub ##per ##io ##ds ( or upper of two sub ##systems ) of the carbon ##iferous period . [SEP]
[CLS] it lasted from roughly { { } } : error ! [SEP]
[CLS] the period you specified has not been recognised ! [SEP]
[CLS] this could be because you mis - sp ##elt it , or because it is missing from or . [SEP]
[CLS] ma ( million years ago ) . [SEP]
[CLS] as with most other geo ##ch ##ron ##olo ##gic units , the rock beds that define the pennsylvania ##n are well identified , but the exact date of the start and end are uncertain by a few hundred thousand years . [SEP]
[CLS] the pennsylvania ##n is named after the u . s . state of pennsylvania , where the coal - productive beds of this age are widespread . [SEP]
[CLS] the division between pennsylvania ##n and mississippi ##an comes from north american st ##rat ##igraphy . [SEP]
[CLS] in north america , where the early carbon ##iferous beds are primarily marine limestone ##s , the pennsylvania ##n was in the past treated as a full - fledged geologic period between the mississippi ##an and the per ##mian . [SEP]
[CLS] in europe , the mississippi ##an and pennsylvania ##n are one more - or - less continuous sequence of lowland continental deposits and are grouped together as the carbon ##iferous period . [SEP]
[CLS] the current internationally used geologic times ##cal ##e of the ic ##s gives the mississippi ##an and pennsylvania ##n the rank of sub ##per ##io ##ds , subdivisions of the carbon ##iferous period . [SEP]
[CLS] all modern classes of fungi have been found in rocks of pennsylvania ##n age . [SEP]
[CLS] amp ##hi ##bians were diverse and common ; some were several meters long as adults . [SEP]
[CLS] the collapse of the rainforest ecology in the mid - pennsylvania ##n ( between the mo ##sco ##vian and the ka ##si ##mo ##vian ) removed many amp ##hi ##bian species that did not survive as well in the cooler , dr ##ier conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] reptiles , however , pro ##sper ##ed due to specific key adaptations . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the greatest evolutionary innovations of the carbon ##iferous was the am ##nio ##te egg , which allowed for the further exploitation of the land by certain te ##tra ##pods . [SEP]
[CLS] these included the earliest sa ##uro ##ps ##id reptiles ( " h ##yl ##ono ##mus " ) , and the earliest known syn ##ap ##si ##d ( " arch ##ae ##oth ##yr ##is " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] small lizard - like animals quickly gave rise to many descendants . [SEP]
[CLS] reptiles underwent a major evolutionary radiation , in response to the dr ##ier climate that followed the rainforest collapse . [SEP]
[CLS] the major forms of life at this time were the art ##hr ##op ##ods . [SEP]
[CLS] due to the high levels of oxygen , art ##hr ##op ##ods were far larger than modern ones . [SEP]
[CLS] " art ##hr ##ople ##ura " , a giant mill ##ipe ##de relative , was a common sight and the giant dragon ##fly " megan ##eur ##a " " flew the skies " . [SEP]
[CLS] the pennsylvania ##n has been variously subdivided . [SEP]
[CLS] the virgil ##ian or cone ##ma ##ugh corresponds to the g ##zh ##elia ##n plus the upper ##most ka ##si ##mo ##vian . [SEP]
[CLS] the missouri ##an or mono ##nga ##hel ##a corresponds to the rest of the ka ##si ##mo ##vian . [SEP]
[CLS] the des ##mo ##ines ##ian or allegheny corresponds to the upper half of the mo ##sco ##vian . [SEP]
[CLS] the at ##oka ##n or upper pot ##ts ##ville corresponds to the lower half of the mo ##sco ##vian . [SEP]
[CLS] the morrow ##an corresponds to the bash ##kir ##ian . [SEP]
[CLS] in the european subdivision , the carbon ##iferous is divided into two epoch ##s : dina ##nti ##an ( early ) and silesian ( late ) . [SEP]
