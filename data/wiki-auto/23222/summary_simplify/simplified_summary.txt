the pennsylvanian conan is the younger of two subperiods aged deposits .
the exact date of the start and end are uncertain by a few thousand years .
the pennsylvanian is named after the u . s . state of pennsylvania .
in north america , where the early carboniferous beds are primarily marine limestones , the pennsylvanian was in the past treated as a full-fledged geologic period between the mississippian and the permian .
in europe , the mississippian and pennsylvanian are one more or less continuous sequence of lowland continental deposits .
the ics is now used by the international geological timescale of the ics .
amphibians were diverse and common .
the collapse of the rainforest ecology in the mid-pennsylvanianpool between the moscovian and the kasimovian ‚Å¥ removed many amphibian species that did not survive as well in the cooler , drier conditions .
one of the greatest evolutionary innovations of the carboniferous was the amniote egg .
reptiles underwent a major evolutionary radiation , in response to the drier climate that followed the rainforest collapse .
arthropods were far larger than modern ones .
the missourian or monongahela corresponds to the rest of the kasimovian .
the desmoinesian or allegheny is the upper half of the moscovian .
the atokan or upper pottsville corresponds to the lower half of the moscovian .
in the european subdivision , the carboniferous is divided into two epochs : dinantian cupping earlyrford prefecture and silesian [mask] late <unk> .
