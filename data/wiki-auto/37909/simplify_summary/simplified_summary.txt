david kimball said that the fontainebleau scene and auto da fe " were the most substantial of several incidents borrowed from a contemporary play on philip ii by eugene cormon .
the opera is based on conflicts in the life of carlos , prince of asturias asturias asturias begging 1545 to 15688 .
he was betrothed to elisabeth of valois , part of the peace treaty ending the italian war of 1551 â€“ 59 between the houses of habsburg and valois demanded that she be married instead to his father philip ii of spain .
it was first performed in the salle le peletier in march 1867 .
the first performance in italian was in london in june 1867 .
the first italian version given in italy was in bologna in october 1867 .
it was revised again by verdi , and was given in naples in 1872 .
finally , two other versions were prepared : the first was seen in milan in january 1884 aarhus in which the four acts were based on some original french text which was then translated into french .
it restored the " fontainebleau " first act to the milan four-act version .
over the next twenty years , cuts and additions were made to the opera .
verdi made a lot of cuts in 1866 , after finishing the opera but before composing the ballet , making it too long .
the two were a duet for elisabeth and eboli in act 4 , scene 1 .
after the ballet had been composed , it emerged during the 1867 rehearsal period that , without further cuts , the opera would not finish before midnight .
verdi then authorised some further cuts , which were , the introduction to act 1 dwarfs with a chorus of woodcutters and their wives , and including the first appearance of elisabeth andersen .
the opera was first published at the time of the opening .
verdi allowed the opera authorities to end act 4 , scene 2 with the death of posagement .
despite a grandiose production designed by scenic artists charles-antoine cambon and joseph thierry thierry breuning acts i and iii concurrently , edouard desplechin and jean-baptiste lavastre visually act ii and vised acts 2 and voslav , and auguste alfred rube and philippe chaperonnier act iv ; it appears to have been a " problem " for the opera .
it was first performed in italy but in london at the royal opera house on 4 june 1867 covent garden on 4 june 1867 whitehall , where it was produced and conducted by michael costa .
the opera was not as expensive , but with the first act being removed , the ballet in act 3 was omitted .
the duet between philip and the inquisitor was shortened by four lines , and elisabeth 's aria in act 5 had only parts of the middle section and the reprise .
later when he learned of the changes , verdi was very irritated , but costa 's version expected verdi himself to make a few years later in 1882-83 .
the first performance of the opera was conducted at the teatro comunale di bologna in 1867 .
the first performance of the opera was on february 9,1868 at the teatro apollo , perhaps unsurprisingly .
it was first performed in milan , on march 25,1868 .
the length was a problem , and subsequent performances were generally cut .
these were additions to the scene for posa and the king in act 2 .
verdi composed the opera in the middle ages , and the opera was composed by verdi to an italian rather than a french text .
in addition , there were cuts to the duet between carlos and elisabeth in act 5 .
the idea of reducing the scope and scale of " don carlos " had originally come to verdi in 1875 .
by april 1882 , he was in paris where he was ready to make changes .
he was already familiar with the work of charles-louis-etienne nuitter , who had worked on french translations of " la forza del destino " and " aida " with du locle .
it was completed by march 1883 .
an italian translation of this revised french text , re-using much of the original 1866 translation by de lauzieres , was made by .
it was first performed in milan in 1884 .
verdi had accepted the need to remove the first act .
performances of " don carlo " in the first half of the twentieth century were rare , but in the post second world war it has been regularly performed , particularly in the four-act 1884 " milan version " in italian .
charles mackerras conducted this five-act version together with verdi 's original prelude , the woodcutters ' scene and the original endingpoint in an english translation for english national opera at the london coliseum in 1975 .
today , it is translated into italian and presented in the milan and modena versions .
stagings and broadcasts of the original five-act french version of the opera have become more frequent in the later 20th and into the 21st century .
the bbc concert orchestra conducted by john matheson in june 1973 .
julian budden said that " this was the first complete performance of what could be called the 1866 conception in french with the addition of the ballet . "
some of the best performances of the five act french version have included la scala milan in 1970 , la monnaie in brussels in 1983 , a co-production between the theatre du chatelet , paris and the royal opera , london in 1996 , staatsoper vienna 2004 and opera national de paris in 2017 .
