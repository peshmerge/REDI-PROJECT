[CLS] don carlos is a five - act grand opera composed by giuseppe verdi to a french - language libretto by joseph mer ##y and camille du lo ##cle , based on the dramatic play " don carlos , infant von span ##ien " ( " don carlos , infant ##e of spain " ) by friedrich sc ##hill ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , it has been noted by david kimball that the fontaine ##ble ##au scene and auto da fe " were the most substantial of several incidents borrowed from a contemporary play on philip ii by eugene co ##rm ##on " . [SEP]
[CLS] though he was bet ##rot ##hed to elisabeth of val ##ois , part of the peace treaty ending the italian war of 155 ##1 – 59 between the houses of habsburg and val ##ois demanded that she be married instead to his father philip ii of spain . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , two other versions were prepared : the first was seen in milan in january 1884 ( in which the four acts were based on some original french text which was then translated ) . [SEP]
[CLS] over the following twenty years , cuts and additions were made to the opera , resulting in a number of versions being available to directors and conductors . [SEP]
[CLS] at its full length ( including the ballet and the cuts made before the first performance ) , it contains close to four hours of music and is verdi ' s longest opera . [SEP]
[CLS] pre - premiere cuts and first published edition [SEP]
[CLS] verdi made a number of cuts in 1866 , after finishing the opera but before composing the ballet , simply because the work was becoming too long . [SEP]
[CLS] these were a duet for elisabeth and e ##bol ##i in act 4 , scene 1 ; a duet for carlos and the king after the death of po ##sa in act 4 , scene 2 ; and an exchange between elisabeth and e ##bol ##i during the insurrection in the same scene . [SEP]
[CLS] after the ballet had been composed , it emerged during the 1867 rehearsal period that , without further cuts , the opera would not finish before midnight ( the time by which patrons would need to leave in order to catch the last trains to the paris suburbs ) . [SEP]
[CLS] verdi then authorised some further cuts , which were , firstly , the introduction to act 1 ( with a chorus of wood ##cut ##ters and their wives , and including the first appearance of elisabeth ) ; secondly , a short entry solo for po ##sa ( " j ' eta ##is en fl ##and ##res " ) in act 2 , scene 1 ; and , third ##ly , part of the dialogue between the king and po ##sa at the end of act 2 , scene 2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the opera , as first published at the time of the premiere , consisted of verdi ' s original conception , without all of the above - named cuts , but including the ballet . [SEP]
[CLS] after the premiere and before leaving paris , verdi authorised the opera authorities to end act 4 , scene 2 with the death of po ##sa ( thus om ##itt ##ing the insurrection scene ) if they thought fit . [SEP]
[CLS] despite a grand ##ios ##e production designed by scenic artists charles - antoine cam ##bon and joseph thierry ( acts i and iii ) , edouard des ##ple ##chin and jean - baptiste lava ##st ##re ( acts ii and v ) , and auguste alfred rub ##e and philippe cha ##per ##on ( act iv ) , it appears to have been a " problem opera " for the opera — it disappeared from its repertoire after 1869 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was common practice at the time for most theatres ( other than those in french - speaking communities ) to perform operas in italian , and an italian translation of " don carlos " was prepared in the autumn of 1866 by ac ##hill ##e de lau ##zier ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the italian translation was first performed not in italy but in london at the royal opera house , covent garden on 4 june 1867 ( now the royal opera house ) , where it was produced and conducted by michael costa . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it was not as verdi desired ; the opera was given in a cut and altered form , with the first act being removed , the ballet in act 3 being omitted , and carlo ' s aria " io la vi ##di " ( originally in act 1 ) being moved to act 3 , just before the ter ##ze ##tto . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , the duet between philip and the in ##qui ##sitor was shortened by four lines , and elisabeth ' s aria in act 5 consisted only of part of the middle section and the reprise . [SEP]
[CLS] later when he learned of the alterations , verdi was greatly irritated , but costa ' s version anticipated revisions verdi himself would make a few years later in 1882 – 83 . [SEP]
[CLS] the italian premiere on 27 october 1867 at the teatro com ##una ##le di bologna , conducted by verdi ' s close friend angelo marian ##i , was an " instant success " , and this version , although produced in verdi ' s absence , was more complete and included the ballet . [SEP]
[CLS] for the rome premiere on 9 february 1868 at the teatro apollo , perhaps un ##sur ##pr ##ising ##ly , the papal ce ##nsor changed the in ##qui ##sitor into a gran cancel ##lier ##e ( grand chancellor ) and the monk / emperor into a sol ##ita ##rio ( rec ##lus ##e ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this version of the opera was first performed in milan at la scala on 25 march 1868 , and prestige productions in most other italian opera houses followed , but it did not become a popular success . [SEP]
[CLS] following the unsuccessful performance in naples in 1871 , verdi was persuaded to visit the city for further performances in november / december 1872 , and he made two more modifications to the score . [SEP]
[CLS] these were additions to the scene for po ##sa and the king in act 2 , scene 2 ( italian verses by antonio g ##his ##lan ##zon ##i ) to replace some of the previously cut material . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the only portion of the entire opera that was ever composed by verdi to an italian rather than a french text . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , there were cuts to the duet between carlos and elisabeth in act 5 . [SEP]
[CLS] the idea of reducing the scope and scale of " don carlos " had originally come to verdi in 1875 , partly as a result of his having heard reports of productions , such as costa ' s , which had removed act 1 and the ballet and introduced cuts to other parts of the opera . [SEP]
[CLS] he was already familiar with the work of charles - louis - etienne nu ##itte ##r , who had worked on french translations of " macbeth " , " la for ##za del des ##tino " and " aid ##a " with du lo ##cle , and the three proceeded to spend nine months on major revisions of the french text and the music to create a four - act version . [SEP]
[CLS] an italian translation of this revised french text , re - using much of the original 1866 translation by de lau ##zier ##es , was made by . [SEP]
[CLS] although verdi had accepted the need to remove the first act , it seems that he changed his mind and allowed a performance which presented the " fontaine ##ble ##au " first act along with the revised four - act version . [SEP]
[CLS] performances of " don carlo " in the first half of the twentieth century were rare , but in the post second world war period it has been regularly performed , particularly in the four - act 1884 " milan version " in italian . [SEP]
[CLS] following the notable 1958 staging of the 1886 five - act " mode ##na version " in italian by the royal opera company , covent garden , directed by luc ##hin ##o vis ##con ##ti and featuring jon vickers as don carlo , tito go ##bb ##i as po ##sa , boris christ ##off as king phillip and gr ##e bro ##uw ##ens ##ti ##jn as elisa ##bet ##ta , this version has increasingly been performed elsewhere and has been recorded by , among others , georg sol ##ti and carlo maria gi ##ulin ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] charles mack ##er ##ras conducted this five - act version ( complete with verdi ' s original prelude , the wood ##cut ##ters ' scene and the original ending ) in an english translation for english national opera at the london coliseum in 1975 . [SEP]
[CLS] today , as translated into italian and presented in the milan and mode ##na versions , the opera has become part of the standard repertory . [SEP]
[CLS] staging ##s and broadcasts of the original five - act french version of the opera have become more frequent in the later 20th and into the 21st century . [SEP]
[CLS] a radio broadcast by or ##tf in france was given in 1967 with a nearly all - french cast , with the exception of the italian matteo man ##ug ##uer ##ra as rod ##rigue . [SEP]
