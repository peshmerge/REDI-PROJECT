[CLS] the book of genesis , the first book of the hebrew bible and the old testament , is judaism ' s account of the creation of the world and the origins of the jewish people . [SEP]
[CLS] the prime ##val history sets out the author ' s ( or authors ' ) concepts of the nature of the deity and of human ##kind ' s relationship with its maker : god creates a world which is good and fit for mankind , but when man corrupt ##s it with sin god decides to destroy his creation , saving only the righteous noah to rees ##ta ##bl ##ish the relationship between man and god . [SEP]
[CLS] jacob ' s name is changed to israel , and through the agency of his son joseph , the children of israel descend into egypt , 70 people in all with their households , and god promises them a future of great ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] genesis ends with israel in egypt , ready for the coming of moses and the exodus . [SEP]
[CLS] the narrative is pun ##ctuated by a series of covenant ##s with god , successively narrowing in scope from all mankind ( the covenant with noah ) to a special relationship with one people alone ( abraham and his descendants through isaac and jacob ) . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity has interpreted genesis as the pre ##fi ##gur ##ation of certain cardinal christian beliefs , primarily the need for salvation ( the hope or assurance of all christians ) and the red ##em ##ptive act of christ on the cross as the fulfillment of covenant promises as the son of god . [SEP]
[CLS] tradition credits moses as the author of genesis , as well as the books of exodus , levi ##ticus , numbers and most of de ##uter ##ono ##my , but modern scholars increasingly see them as a product of the 6th and 5th centuries bc . [SEP]
[CLS] genesis appears to be structured around the recurring phrase " elle ##h toledo ##t " , meaning " these are the generations , " with the first use of the phrase referring to the " generations of heaven and earth " and the remainder marking individuals — noah , the " sons of noah " , she ##m , etc . , down to jacob . [SEP]
[CLS] while the first is far shorter than the second , it sets out the basic themes and provides an interpret ##ive key for understanding the entire book . [SEP]
[CLS] god creates the world in six days and con ##se ##crat ##es the seventh as a day of rest . [SEP]
[CLS] god creates the first humans adam and eve and all the animals in the garden of eden but ins ##truct ##s them not to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil . [SEP]
[CLS] a talking serpent portrayed as a dec ##eptive creature or tricks ##ter , en ##tic ##es eve into eating it against god ' s wishes , and she en ##tic ##es adam , whereupon god throws them out and curses them — adam to getting what he needs only by sweat and work , and eve to giving birth in pain . [SEP]
[CLS] this is interpreted by christians as the fall of humanity . [SEP]
[CLS] after many generations of adam have passed from the lines of cain and seth , the world becomes corrupted by human sin and ne ##phi ##lim , and god determines to wipe out humanity . [SEP]
[CLS] god sees mankind cooper ##ating to build a great tower city , the tower of babe ##l , and divides humanity with many languages and sets them apart with confusion . [SEP]
[CLS] there , god makes a covenant with ab ##ram , promising that his descendants shall be as numerous as the stars , but that people will suffer oppression in a foreign land for four hundred years , after which they will inherit the land " from the river of egypt to the great river , the river eu ##ph ##rates " . [SEP]
[CLS] due to her old age , sarah tells abraham to take her egyptian hand ##maid ##en , ha ##gar , as a second wife . [SEP]
[CLS] lot ' s daughters , concerned that they are fugitive ##s who will never find husbands , get him drunk to become pregnant by him , and give birth to the ancestors of the mo ##abi ##tes and am ##mon ##ites . [SEP]
[CLS] sarah drives is ##hma ##el and his mother ha ##gar out into the wilderness , but god saves them and promises to make is ##hma ##el a great nation . [SEP]
[CLS] on the death of sarah , abraham purchases mach ##pel ##ah ( believed to be modern he ##bron ) for a family tomb and sends his servant to mesopotamia to find among his relations a wife for isaac ; after proving herself , re ##bek ##ah becomes isaac ' s bet ##rot ##hed . [SEP]
[CLS] through deception , jacob becomes the heir instead of esa ##u and gains his father ' s blessing . [SEP]
[CLS] he flees to his uncle where he pro ##sper ##s and earn ##s his two wives , rachel and leah . [SEP]
[CLS] jacob ' s name is changed to israel , and by his wives and their hand ##maid ##ens he has twelve sons , the ancestors of the twelve tribes of the children of israel , and a daughter , dinah . [SEP]
[CLS] joseph , jacob ' s favorite son , makes his brothers jealous and they sell him into slavery in egypt . [SEP]
[CLS] he is then reunited with his father and brothers , who fail to recognize him , and plead for food . [SEP]
[CLS] joseph lives to an old age and ex ##hort ##s his brethren , if god should lead them out of the country , to take his bones with them . [SEP]
[CLS] there are four major textual witnesses to the book : the mas ##ore ##tic text , the sam ##ari ##tan pen ##tate ##uch , the sept ##ua ##gin ##t , and fragments of genesis found at qu ##m ##ran . [SEP]
[CLS] for much of the 20th century most scholars agreed that the five books of the pen ##tate ##uch — genesis , exodus , levi ##ticus , numbers and de ##uter ##ono ##my — came from four sources , the ya ##h ##wi ##st , the el ##oh ##ist , the de ##uter ##ono ##mist and the priest ##ly source , each telling the same basic story , and joined together by various editors . [SEP]
[CLS] since the 1970s there has been a revolution leading scholars to view the el ##oh ##ist source as no more than a variation on the ya ##h ##wi ##st , and the priest ##ly source as a body of revisions and expansion ##s to the ya ##h ##wi ##st ( or " non - priest ##ly " ) material . [SEP]
[CLS] in genesis these include three different accounts of a patriarch claiming that his wife was his sister , the two creation stories , and the two versions of abraham sending ha ##gar and is ##hma ##el into the desert . [SEP]
[CLS] scholars in the first half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that the ya ##h ##wi ##st is a product of the monarch ##ic period , specifically at the court of solomon , 10th century bc , and the priest ##ly work in the middle of the 5th century bc ( with claims that the author is ezra ) , but more recent thinking is that the ya ##h ##wi ##st is from either just before or during the babylonian exile of the 6th century bc , and the priest ##ly final edition was made late in the ex ##ili ##c period or soon after . [SEP]
[CLS] as for why the book was created , a theory which has gained considerable interest , although still controversial is " persian imperial author ##isation " . [SEP]
[CLS] this proposes that the persians of the ac ##hae ##men ##id empire , after their conquest of babylon in 53 ##9 bc , agreed to grant jerusalem a large measure of local autonomy within the empire , but required the local authorities to produce a single law code accepted by the entire community . [SEP]
[CLS] the two powerful groups making up the community — the priest ##ly families who controlled the temple and who traced their origin to moses and the wilderness wandering ##s , and the major land ##own ##ing families who made up the " elders " and who traced their own origins to abraham , who had " given " them the land — were in conflict over many issues , and each had its own " history of origins " , but the persian promise of greatly increased local autonomy for all provided a powerful incentive to cooperate in producing a single text . [SEP]
[CLS] genesis is perhaps best seen as an example of a creation myth , a type of literature telling of the first appearance of humans , the stories of ancestors and heroes , and the origins of culture , cities and so forth . [SEP]
[CLS] the most notable examples are found in the work of greek historians of the 6th century bc : their intention was to connect notable families of their own day to a distant and heroic past , and in doing so they did not distinguish between myth , legend , and facts . [SEP]
[CLS] ska also points out the purpose behind such anti ##qua ##rian histories : antiquity is needed to prove the worth of israel ' s traditions to the nations ( the neighbours of the jews in early persian palestine ) , and to reconcile and unite the various factions within israel itself . [SEP]
[CLS] ( it is , however , worth noting that in the ja ##h ##wi ##st source the patriarch ##s refer to deity by the name y ##h ##w ##h , for example in genesis 15 . ) [SEP]
[CLS] through the patriarch ##s god announces the election of israel , meaning that he has chosen israel to be his special people and committed himself to their future . [SEP]
[CLS] to israel ) , and israel is expected to have faith in god and his promise . [SEP]
[CLS] ( " faith " in the context of genesis and the hebrew bible means agreement to the prom ##iss ##ory relationship , not a body of belief ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the fu ##lf ##il ##ment of the promise to each patriarch depends on having a male heir , and the story is constantly complicated by the fact that each prospective mother – sarah , re ##bek ##ah and rachel – is barren . [SEP]
[CLS] the ancestors , however , retain their faith in god and god in each case gives a son – in jacob ' s case , twelve sons , the foundation of the chosen israeli ##tes . [SEP]
[CLS] each succeeding generation of the three promises attain ##s a more rich fulfillment , until through joseph " all the world " attain ##s salvation from famine , and by bringing the children of israel down to egypt he becomes the means through which the promise can be fulfilled . [SEP]
[CLS] scholars generally agree that the theme of divine promise unite ##s the patriarch ##al cycles , but many would dispute the efficacy of trying to examine genesis ' theology by pursuing a single over ##ar ##ching theme , instead citing as more productive the analysis of the abraham cycle , the jacob cycle , and the joseph cycle , and the ya ##h ##wi ##st and priest ##ly sources . [SEP]
[CLS] the problem lies in finding a way to unite the patriarch ##al theme of divine promise to the stories of genesis 1 – 11 ( the prime ##val history ) with their theme of god ' s forgiveness in the face of man ' s evil nature . [SEP]
[CLS] one solution is to see the patriarch ##al stories as resulting from god ' s decision not to remain alien ##ated from mankind : god creates the world and mankind , mankind rebels , and god " elects " ( chooses ) abraham . [SEP]
[CLS] the first covenant is between god and all living creatures , and is marked by the sign of the rainbow ; the second is with the descendants of abraham ( is ##hma ##eli ##tes and others as well as israeli ##tes ) , and its sign is ci ##rc ##um ##cision ; and the last , which does not appear until the book of exodus , is with israel alone , and its sign is sabbath .
