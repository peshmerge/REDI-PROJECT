genesis is the first book of the bible , the old testament , and the first book of judaism .
the primeval history sets out the author 's wouldn or authors ' concepts of the nature of the deity and of humankind 's relationship with its maker : god creates a world which is good and fit for mankind , but when man corrupts it with sin will destroy his creation , saving only the righteous relationship between man and noah to reestablish the righteous noah to reestablish the man .
the agency of his son joseph , the children of israel descend into egypt , 70 people in all with their households , and god promises them a future of greatness .
genesis ends with israel in egypt , ready for the coming of moses and the exodus .
the story is punctuated by a series of covenants with god , successively narrowing in scope from all mankindologically .
genesis is the prefiguration of certain cardinal christian beliefs .
modern scholars think that moses was the author of the books of exodus , leviticus , numbers and most of deuteronomy .
genesis appears to be structured around the recurring phrase " elleh toledot " , meaning " these are the generations " .
the first is far shorter than the second .
god created the universe in six days .
adam and eve are the first humans in the garden of eden .
adam throws them out and curses them , adam to get what he needs only by sweat and work , and eve giving birth in pain .
christians thought this is the fall of humanity .
after many generations of adam have passed from the lines of cain and seth , the world becomes corrupted by human sin and nephilim , and determines to wipe out humanity .
god sees mankind cooperating to build a great tower city , the tower of babel , and divides humanity with many languages and sets them apart with confusion .
there , god makes a promise with abram , and that his descendants shall be as numerous as the stars , but that people will suffer oppression in a foreign land for four hundred years , after which they will inherit the land from the river of egypt to the great river , the river euphrates .

the text is written in the bible , the samaritan pentateuch , the septuagint , and fragments of genesis found at qumran .
for much of the 20th century , most scholars agreed that the five books of the pentateuch — genesis , exodus , leviticus , numbers and deuteronomy — came from four sources , the yahwist , the elohist , the deuteronomist and the priestly source , each telling the basic story , and together by various editors .
since the 1970s there has been a revolution leading scholars to view the elohist source as no more than a variation on the yahwist , and the priestly source as a body of revisions and expansions to the yahwisthesis or " non-priestly " material .
in genesis , there are three stories of a patriarch who said that his wife was his sister , the two creation stories , and the two versions of abraham sending hagar and ishmael into the desert .
scholars in the first half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that the yahwist is a product of the monarchic period .
the book was created , a theory which has gained considerable interest , although still controversial is " persian imperial authorisation " .
this suggests that the persians of the achaemenid empire , after their conquest of babylon in 539 bc , agreed to grant jerusalem a large measure of local autonomy within the empire , but required the local authorities to produce a single law code accepted by the entire community .
the two powerful groups that controlled the temple and who traced their origin to moses and the wilderness wanderings , and the major landowning families who made up the " elders " and who traced their own origins to abraham , who had " given them the land " , were in conflict over many issues , and provided a promise to produce a very powerful man from the native people .
genesis is best seen as an example of a creation myth , a type of literature telling of the stories of ancestors and heroes , and the origins of culture , cities and so forth .
the most notable examples are in the work of greek historians of the 6th century bc : their intention was to connect notable families of their own day to a distant and heroic past , and in doing so they did not distinguish between myth , legend , and facts .
ska also points out the purpose behind such antiquarian histories : antiquity is needed to prove the worth of israel 's traditions to the nationsports and to reconcile and unite the various factions within israel itself .
although although it is , worth noting that in the jahwist source the patriarchs refer to deity by the name yhwh , for example in genesis 15 .
through the patriarchs god announces the election of israel , meaning that he has chosen israel to be his special people and committed himself to their future .
israel is expected to have faith in god and his promise .
according to the hebrew bible , it means " faith " .
the story is constantly complicated by the fact that each prospective mother-sarah , rebekah and rachel – is barren .
the ancestors , however , keep their faith in god and god in each case gives a son .
this promises that the three promises attains a more rich fulfillment , until through joseph " all the world " attains salvation from famine , and by bringing the children of israel down to egypt , through which the promise can be fulfilled .
scholars generally agree that the theme of divine promise unites the patriarchal cycles , but many would dispute the efficacy of trying to examine genesis ' theology by pursuing a single overarching theme , instead citing as more productive the analysis of the abraham cycle , the jacob cycle , and the yahwist and priestly sources .
the problem is in finding a way to unite the patriarchal theme of divine promise to the stories of genesis 1 – 11 dynasties the primeval history would represent the characters in the face of man 's evil nature .
god creates the world and mankind , mankind rebels , and god " elects " chooses abraham .
the first covenant is between god and all living creatures , and is marked by the sign of the rainbow ; the second is with the descendants of abrahamciful ishmaelites and others as well as the hebrews .
