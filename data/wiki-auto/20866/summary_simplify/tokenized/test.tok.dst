[CLS] meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis is a biological process by which an animal physically develops after birth or hatch ##ing , involving a conspicuous and relatively abrupt change in the animal ' s body structure through cell growth and differentiation . [SEP]
[CLS] scientific usage of the term is technically precise , and it is not applied to general aspects of cell growth , including rapid growth spur ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] references to " meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis " in mammals are imp ##re ##cise and only col ##lo ##qui ##al , but historically ideal ##ist ideas of transformation and mona ##do ##logy , as in goethe ' s " meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis of plants " , have influenced the development of ideas of evolution . [SEP]
[CLS] pt ##th also stimulate ##s the corp ##ora alla ##ta , a retro ##cer ##eb ##ral organ , to produce juvenile hormone , which prevents the development of adult characteristics during ec ##dy ##sis . [SEP]
[CLS] in ho ##lom ##eta ##bol ##ous insects , mo ##lts between la ##rval ins ##tar ##s have a high level of juvenile hormone , the mo ##ult to the pup ##al stage has a low level of juvenile hormone , and the final , or im ##agi ##nal , mo ##lt has no juvenile hormone present at all . [SEP]
[CLS] all three categories of meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis can be found in the diversity of insects , including no meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis ( " am ##eta ##bol ##y " ) , incomplete or partial meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis ( " hem ##ime ##ta ##bol ##y " ) , and complete meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis ( " ho ##lom ##eta ##bol ##y " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] while am ##eta ##bol ##ous insects show very little difference between la ##rval and adult forms ( also known as " direct development " ) , both hem ##ime ##ta ##bol ##ous and ho ##lom ##eta ##bol ##ous insects have significant morphological and behavioral differences between la ##rval and adult forms , the most significant being the inclusion , in ho ##lom ##eta ##bol ##us organisms , of a pup ##al or resting stage between the la ##rval and adult forms . [SEP]
[CLS] in hem ##ime ##ta ##bol ##ous insects , immature stages are called ny ##mp ##hs . [SEP]
[CLS] the size and morphological differences between ny ##mp ##hs in different ins ##tar ##s are small , often just differences in body proportions and the number of segments ; in later ins ##tar ##s , external wing buds form . [SEP]
[CLS] insects which undergo ho ##lom ##eta ##bol ##ism pass through a la ##rval stage , then enter an inactive state called pup ##a ( called a " ch ##rys ##alis " in butterfly species ) , and finally emerge as adults . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest insect forms showed direct development ( am ##eta ##bol ##ism ) , and the evolution of meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis in insects is thought to have fuel ##led their dramatic radiation ( 1 , 2 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some early am ##eta ##bol ##ous " true insects " are still present today , such as br ##istle ##tails and silver ##fish . [SEP]
[CLS] phylogenetic ##ally , all insects in the pt ##ery ##go ##ta undergo a marked change in form , texture and physical appearance from immature stage to adult . [SEP]
[CLS] these insects either have hem ##ime ##ta ##bol ##ous development , and undergo an incomplete or partial meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis , or ho ##lom ##eta ##bol ##ous development , which undergo a complete meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis , including a pup ##al or resting stage between the la ##rval and adult forms . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of h ##yp ##oth ##eses have been proposed to explain the evolution of ho ##lom ##eta ##bol ##y from hem ##ime ##ta ##bol ##y , mostly center ##ing on whether or not the intermediate hem ##ime ##ta ##bol ##ous forms are homo ##log ##ous to pup ##al form of ho ##lom ##eta ##bol ##ous forms . [SEP]
[CLS] more recently , scientific attention has turned to character ##izing the me ##chan ##istic basis of meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis in terms of its ho ##rm ##onal control , by character ##izing spatial and temporal patterns of hormone expression relative to meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis in a wide range of insects . [SEP]
[CLS] another cater ##pi ##llar , the ornate moth cater ##pi ##llar , is able to carry toxin ##s that it acquire ##s from its diet through meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis and into adulthood , where the toxin ##s still serve for protection against predators . [SEP]
[CLS] below are the sequence of the meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis of the butterfly ( illustrated ) [SEP]
[CLS] 1 – the la ##rva of a butterfly 2 – the pup ##a is now sp ##ew ##ing the thread to form coco ##on 3 – the co ##cco ##on is fully formed 4 – adult butterfly coming out of the coco ##on [SEP]
[CLS] in ce ##pha ##lo ##cho ##rda ##ta , meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis is io ##dot ##hy ##ron ##ine - induced and it could be an ancestral feature of all chord ##ates . [SEP]
[CLS] the salmon is dia ##dro ##mous , meaning that it changes from a freshwater to a salt ##water lifestyle . [SEP]
[CLS] many species of flat ##fish begin their life bilateral ##ly symmetrical , with an eye on either side of the body ; but one eye moves to join the other side of the fish – which becomes the upper side – in the adult form . [SEP]
[CLS] the european eel has a number of meta ##mo ##rp ##hos ##es , from the la ##rval stage to the le ##pt ##oc ##ep ##hal ##us stage , then a quick meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis to glass eel at the edge of the continental shelf ( eight days for the japanese eel ) , two months at the border of fresh and salt water where the glass eel undergoes a quick meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis into el ##ver , then a long stage of growth followed by a more gradual meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis to the migrating phase . [SEP]
[CLS] in the pre - adult freshwater stage , the eel also has ph ##eno ##typic plastic ##ity because fish - eating eels develop very wide man ##di ##bles , making the head look blunt . [SEP]
[CLS] most other bony fish undergo meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis from embryo to la ##rva ( fry ) and then to the juvenile stage during absorption of the yo ##lk sac , because after that phase the individual needs to be able to feed for itself . [SEP]
[CLS] in typical amp ##hi ##bian development , eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle . [SEP]
[CLS] frogs , toad ##s , and newt ##s all hatch from the eggs as larvae with external gills but it will take some time for the amp ##hi ##bians to interact outside with pulmonary res ##piration . [SEP]
[CLS] after meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis , these organs become redundant and will be res ##or ##bed by controlled cell death , called ap ##op ##tosis . [SEP]
[CLS] with frogs and toad ##s , the external gills of the newly hatch ##ed tad ##pole are covered with a gill sac after a few days , and lungs are quickly formed . [SEP]
[CLS] front legs are formed under the gill sac , and hind ##leg ##s are visible a few days later . [SEP]
[CLS] following that there is usually a longer stage during which the tad ##pole lives off a vegetarian diet . [SEP]
[CLS] rapid changes in the body can then be observed as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely . [SEP]
[CLS] eyes and legs grow quickly , a tongue is formed , and all this is accompanied by associated changes in the neural networks ( development of stereo ##scopic vision , loss of the lateral line system , etc . ) [SEP]
[CLS] it is not until a few days later that the tail is re ##ab ##sor ##bed , due to the higher thy ##ro ##xin concentrations required for tail res ##or ##ption . [SEP]
[CLS] the sal ##aman ##der development is highly diverse ; some species go through a dramatic reorganization when transition ##ing from aquatic larvae to terrestrial adults , while others , such as the ax ##olo ##tl , display pa ##edo ##mo ##rp ##hosis and never develop into terrestrial adults . [SEP]
[CLS] in newt ##s , there is no true meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis because newt larvae already feed as predators and continue doing so as adults . [SEP]
[CLS] just as in tad ##pole ##s , their lungs are functional early , but newt ##s use them less frequently than tad ##pole ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] external gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time . [SEP]
[CLS] more recently diver ##ged ca ##ec ##ilia ##ns ( the ter ##es ##oma ##ta ) do not undergo an onto ##gen ##etic niche shift of this sort and are in general f ##oss ##oria ##l throughout their lives . [SEP]
