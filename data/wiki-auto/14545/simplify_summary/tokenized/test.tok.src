[CLS] i , robot is a fix ##up novel of science fiction short stories or essays by american writer isaac as ##imov . [SEP]
[CLS] the stories originally appeared in the american magazines " super science stories " and " as ##tou ##nding science fiction " between 1940 and 1950 and were then compiled into a book for stand - alone publication by gnome press in 1950 , in an initial edition of 5 , 000 copies . [SEP]
[CLS] the stories are woven together by a framing narrative in which the fictional dr . susan calvin tells each story to a reporter ( who serves as the narrator ) in the 21st century . [SEP]
[CLS] although the stories can be read separately , they share a theme of the interaction of humans , robots , and morality , and when combined they tell a larger story of as ##imov ' s fictional history of robotics . [SEP]
[CLS] several of the stories feature the character of dr . calvin , chief rob ##ops ##ych ##ologist at u . s . robots and mechanical men , inc . , the major manufacturer of robots . [SEP]
[CLS] upon their publication in this collection , as ##imov wrote a framing sequence presenting the stories as calvin ' s re ##mini ##sc ##ence ##s during an interview with her about her life ' s work , chiefly concerned with abe ##rran ##t behaviour of robots and the use of " rob ##ops ##ych ##ology " to sort out what is happening in their po ##sit ##ron ##ic brain . [SEP]
[CLS] the book also contains the short story in which as ##imov ' s three laws of robotics first appear , which had large influence on later science fiction and had impact on thought on ethics of artificial intelligence as well . [SEP]
[CLS] other characters that appear in these short stories are powell and donovan , a field - testing team which locate ##s flaws in us ##rm ##m ' s prototype models . [SEP]
[CLS] the collection shares a title with the 1939 short story " i , robot " by ea ##ndo bind ##er ( pseudonym of earl and otto bind ##er ) , which greatly influenced as ##imov . [SEP]
[CLS] as ##imov had wanted to call his collection " mind and iron " and objected when the publisher made the title the same as bind ##er ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] " the new york times " described " i , robot " as " an exciting science thriller which could be fun for those whose nerves are not already made raw by the potential ##ities of the atomic age . " [SEP]
[CLS] describing it as " continuously fascinating " , gr ##off con ##k ##lin " un ##res ##erved ##ly recommended " the book . [SEP]
[CLS] p . sc ##hu ##yler miller recommended the collection " for puzzle situations , for humor , for warm character , and for most of the values of plain good writing " . [SEP]
[CLS] at least three of the short stories from " i , robot " have been adapted for television . [SEP]
[CLS] the first was a 1962 episode of " out of this world " hosted by boris karl ##off called " little lost robot " with maxi ##ne au ##dley as susan calvin . [SEP]
[CLS] two short stories from the collection were made into episodes of " out of the unknown " : " the prophet " ( 1967 ) , based on " reason " ; and " liar ! " [SEP]
[CLS] the 12th episode of the ussr science fiction tv series " this fantastic world " , filmed in 1987 and entitled " don ' t joke with robots " , was based on works by aleksandr bel ##ya ##ev and fredrik ki ##lander as well as as ##imov ' s " liar ! " [SEP]
[CLS] both the original and revival series of " the outer limits " include episodes named " i , robot " ; however , both are adaptations of the earl and otto bind ##er story of that name and are un ##connected with as ##imov ' s work . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late 1970s , warner bros . acquired the option to make a film based on the book , but no screenplay was ever accepted . [SEP]
[CLS] the most notable attempt was one by harlan ellison , who collaborated with as ##imov himself to create a version which captured the spirit of the original . [SEP]
[CLS] as ##imov is quoted as saying that this screenplay would lead to " the first really adult , complex , worth ##while science fiction movie ever made . " [SEP]
[CLS] ellison ' s script builds a framework around as ##imov ' s short stories that involves a reporter named robert brat ##ena ##hl tracking down information about susan calvin ' s alleged former lover stephen bye ##rly . [SEP]
[CLS] as ##imov ' s stories are presented as flashbacks that differ from the originals in their stronger emphasis on calvin ' s character . [SEP]
[CLS] ellison placed calvin into stories in which she did not originally appear and flesh ##ed out her character ' s role in ones where she did . [SEP]
[CLS] in constructing the script as a series of flashbacks that focused on character development rather than action , ellison used the film " citizen kane " as a model . [SEP]
[CLS] although acclaimed by critics , the screenplay is generally considered to have been un ##film ##able based upon the technology and average film budgets of the time . [SEP]
[CLS] as ##imov also believed that the film may have been scrapped because of a conflict between ellison and the producers : when the producers suggested changes in the script , instead of being diplomatic as advised by as ##imov , ellison " reacted violently " and offended the producers . [SEP]
[CLS] the script was serialized in " as ##imov ' s science fiction " magazine in late 1987 , and eventually appeared in book form under the title " i , robot : the illustrated screenplay " , in 1994 ( reprinted 2004 , ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the film " i , robot " , starring will smith , was released by twentieth century fox on july 16 , 2004 in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] its plot incorporates elements of " little lost robot " , some of as ##imov ' s character names and the " three laws " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the plot of the movie is mostly original work adapted from the screenplay " hard ##wire ##d " by jeff vin ##tar , completely un ##link ##ed to as ##imov ' s stories and has been compared to as ##imov ' s " the caves of steel " , which revolves around the murder of a robotic ##ist ( although the rest of the film ' s plot is not based on that novel or other works by as ##imov ) . [SEP]
