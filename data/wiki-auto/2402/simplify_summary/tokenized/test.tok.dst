[CLS] albrecht du ##rer ( ; ] ; 21 may 147 ##1 – 6 april 152 ##8 ) sometimes sp ##elt in english as du ##rer or due ##rer , without um ##lau ##t , was a painter , print ##maker , and theorist of the german renaissance . [SEP]
[CLS] born in nuremberg , du ##rer established his reputation and influence across europe when he was still in his twenties due to his high - quality wood ##cut prints . [SEP]
[CLS] he was in communication with the major italian artists of his time , including raphael , giovanni bell ##ini and leonardo da vinci , and from 151 ##2 he was patron ##ized by emperor maximilian i . du ##rer is commemorated by both the lutheran and episcopal churches . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer ' s vast body of work includes engravings , his preferred technique in his later prints , altar ##piece ##s , portraits and self - portraits , water ##col ##ours and books . [SEP]
[CLS] the wood ##cut ##s , such as the " apocalypse " series ( 149 ##8 ) , are more gothic than the rest of his work . [SEP]
[CLS] his well - known engravings include the " knight , death and the devil " ( 151 ##3 ) , " saint jerome in his study " ( 151 ##4 ) and " mel ##en ##col ##ia i " ( 151 ##4 ) , which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation . [SEP]
[CLS] his water ##col ##ours also mark him as one of the first european landscape artists , while his ambitious wood ##cut ##s revolution ##ized the potential of that medium . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer ' s introduction of classical motifs into northern art , through his knowledge of italian artists and german humanist ##s , has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the northern renaissance . [SEP]
[CLS] this is reinforced by his theoretical treatise ##s , which involve principles of mathematics , perspective , and ideal proportions . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer was born on 21 may 147 ##1 , third child and second son of his parents , who had at least fourteen and possibly as many as eighteen children . [SEP]
[CLS] his father , albrecht du ##rer the elder ( originally albrecht aj ##tos ##i ) , was a successful goldsmith who in 145 ##5 had moved to nuremberg from aj ##tos , near g ##yu ##la in hungary . [SEP]
[CLS] one of albrecht ' s brothers , hans du ##rer , was also a painter and trained under him . [SEP]
[CLS] another of albrecht ' s brothers , end ##res du ##rer , took over their father ' s business and was a master goldsmith . [SEP]
[CLS] the german name " du ##rer " is a translation from the hungarian , " aj ##tos ##i " . [SEP]
[CLS] initially , it was " tu ##rer " , meaning door ##maker , which is " aj ##tos " in hungarian ( from " aj ##to " , meaning door ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a door is featured in the coat - of - arms the family acquired . [SEP]
[CLS] albrecht du ##rer the younger later changed " tu ##rer " , his father ' s di ##ction of the family ' s surname , to " du ##rer " , to adapt to the local nuremberg dialect . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer the elder married barbara ho ##lp ##er , daughter of his master when he himself qualified as a master in 146 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer ' s godfather was anton kobe ##rger , who left goldsmith ##ing to become a printer and publisher in the year of du ##rer ' s birth , and became the most successful publisher in germany , eventually owning twenty - four printing - presses and built a number of offices in germany and abroad . [SEP]
[CLS] kobe ##rger ' s most famous publication was the " nuremberg chronicle " , published in 149 ##3 in german and latin editions . [SEP]
[CLS] it contained an unprecedented 1 , 80 ##9 wood ##cut illustrations ( albeit with many repeated uses of the same block ) by the wo ##lge ##mut workshop . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer may have worked on some of these , as the work on the project began while he was with wo ##lge ##mut . [SEP]
[CLS] because du ##rer left autobiographical writings and became very famous by his mid - twenties , his life is well documented by several sources . [SEP]
[CLS] after a few years of school , du ##rer started to learn the basics of goldsmith ##ing and drawing from his father . [SEP]
[CLS] though his father wanted him to continue his training as a goldsmith , he showed such a pre ##co ##cious talent in drawing that he started as an apprentice to michael wo ##lge ##mut at the age of fifteen in 148 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] a self - portrait , a drawing in silver ##point , is dated 148 ##4 ( albert ##ina , vienna ) " when i was a child " , as his later inscription says . [SEP]
[CLS] wo ##lge ##mut was the leading artist in nuremberg at the time , with a large workshop producing a variety of works of art , in particular wood ##cut ##s for books . [SEP]
[CLS] nuremberg was then an important and prosperous city , a centre for publishing and many luxury trades . [SEP]
[CLS] it had strong links with italy , especially venice , a relatively short distance across the alps . [SEP]
[CLS] after completing his apprenticeship , du ##rer followed the common german custom of taking " wander ##jah ##re " — in effect gap years — in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas ; du ##rer was to spend about four years away . [SEP]
[CLS] he left in 149 ##0 , possibly to work under martin sc ##hong ##auer , the leading engraver of northern europe , but who died shortly before du ##rer ' s arrival at col ##mar in 149 ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] it is unclear where du ##rer travelled in the intervening period , though it is likely that he went to frankfurt and the netherlands . [SEP]
[CLS] in col ##mar , du ##rer was welcomed by sc ##hong ##auer ' s brothers , the goldsmith ##s cas ##par and paul and the painter ludwig . [SEP]
[CLS] in 149 ##3 du ##rer went to strasbourg , where he would have experienced the sculpture of nikola ##us ge ##rh ##aer ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer ' s first painted self - portrait ( now in the louvre ) was painted at this time , probably to be sent back to his fiancee in nuremberg . [SEP]
[CLS] in early 149 ##2 du ##rer travelled to basel to stay with another brother of martin sc ##hong ##auer , the goldsmith georg . [SEP]
[CLS] very soon after his return to nuremberg , on 7 july 149 ##4 , at the age of 23 , du ##rer was married to agnes frey following an arrangement made during his absence . [SEP]
[CLS] agnes was the daughter of a prominent brass worker ( and amateur harp ##ist ) in the city . [SEP]
[CLS] however , no children resulted from the marriage , and with albrecht the du ##rer name died out . [SEP]
[CLS] the marriage between agnes and albrecht was not a generally happy one , as indicated by the letters of du ##rer in which he qui ##pped to will ##iba ##ld pi ##rc ##kh ##eim ##er in an extremely rough tone about his wife . [SEP]
[CLS] he called her an " old crow " and made other vulgar remarks . [SEP]
[CLS] pi ##rc ##kh ##eim ##er also made no secret of his anti ##pathy towards agnes , describing her as a mis ##erly sh ##rew with a bitter tongue , who helped cause du ##rer ' s death at a young age . [SEP]
[CLS] it is speculated by many scholars albrecht was bisexual , if not homosexual , due to several of his works containing themes of homosexual desire , as well as the intimate nature of his correspondence with certain very close male friends . [SEP]
[CLS] within three months of his marriage , du ##rer left for italy , alone , perhaps stimulated by an outbreak of plague in nuremberg . [SEP]
[CLS] he made water ##col ##our sketches as he traveled over the alps . [SEP]
[CLS] some have survived and others may be de ##duced from accurate landscapes of real places in his later work , for example his engraving " nemesis " . [SEP]
[CLS] in italy , he went to venice to study its more advanced artistic world . [SEP]
[CLS] through wo ##lge ##mut ' s tu ##tel ##age , du ##rer had learned how to make prints in dry ##point and design wood ##cut ##s in the german style , based on the works of martin sc ##hong ##auer and the house ##book master . [SEP]
[CLS] he also would have had access to some italian works in germany , but the two visits he made to italy had an enormous influence on him . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote that giovanni bell ##ini was the oldest and still the best of the artists in venice . [SEP]
[CLS] his drawings and engravings show the influence of others , notably antonio poll ##ai ##uo ##lo , with his interest in the proportions of the body ; lorenzo di cr ##ed ##i ; and andrea man ##te ##gna , whose work he produced copies of while training . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer probably also visited padua and man ##tua on this trip . [SEP]
[CLS] on his return to nuremberg in 149 ##5 , du ##rer opened his own workshop ( being married was a requirement for this ) . [SEP]
[CLS] over the next five years his style increasingly integrated italian influences into underlying northern forms . [SEP]
[CLS] arguably his best works in the first years of the workshop were his wood ##cut prints , mostly religious , but including secular scenes such as " the men ' s bath house " ( ca . 149 ##6 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of german wood ##cut ##s hit ##her ##to , and far more complex and balanced in composition . [SEP]
[CLS] it is now thought unlikely that du ##rer cut any of the wood ##block ##s himself ; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman . [SEP]
[CLS] however , his training in wo ##lge ##mut ' s studio , which made many carved and painted altar ##piece ##s and both designed and cut wood ##block ##s for wood ##cut , evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce , and how to work with block cutter ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer either drew his design directly onto the wood ##block itself , or glued a paper drawing to the block . [SEP]
[CLS] either way , his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block . [SEP]
[CLS] his famous series of sixteen great designs for the " apocalypse " is dated 149 ##8 , as is his engraving of " st . michael fighting the dragon " . [SEP]
[CLS] he made the first seven scenes of the " great passion " in the same year , and a little later , a series of eleven on the holy family and saints . [SEP]
[CLS] the " seven sorrow ##s poly ##pt ##ych " , commissioned by frederick iii of saxony in 149 ##6 , was executed by du ##rer and his assistants c . 1500 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 150 ##2 , du ##rer ' s father died . [SEP]
[CLS] around 150 ##3 – 150 ##5 du ##rer produced the first 17 of a set illustrating the " life of the virgin " , which he did not finish for some years . [SEP]
[CLS] neither these nor the " great passion " were published as sets until several years later , but prints were sold individually in considerable numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] during the same period du ##rer trained himself in the difficult art of using the bu ##rin to make engravings . [SEP]
[CLS] it is possible he had begun learning this skill during his early training with his father , as it was also an essential skill of the goldsmith . [SEP]
[CLS] in 149 ##6 he executed the " pro ##di ##gal son " , which the italian renaissance art historian giorgio va ##sari singled out for praise some decades later , noting its germanic quality . [SEP]
[CLS] he was soon producing some spectacular and original images , notably " nemesis " ( 150 ##2 ) , " the sea monster " ( 149 ##8 ) , and " saint eu ##sta ##ce " ( c . 150 ##1 ) , with a highly detailed landscape background and animals . [SEP]
[CLS] his landscapes of this period , such as " pond in the woods " and " willow mill " , are quite different from his earlier water ##col ##ours . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a much greater emphasis on capturing atmosphere , rather than depicting topography . [SEP]
[CLS] he made a number of madonna ##s , single religious figures , and small scenes with comic peasant figures . [SEP]
[CLS] prints are highly portable and these works made du ##rer famous throughout the main artistic centres of europe within a very few years . [SEP]
[CLS] the venetian artist ja ##co ##po de ' bar ##bari , whom du ##rer had met in venice , visited nuremberg in 1500 , and du ##rer said that he learned much about the new developments in perspective , anatomy , and proportion from him . [SEP]
[CLS] de ' bar ##bari was unwilling to explain everything he knew , so du ##rer began his own studies , which would become a lifelong pre ##oc ##cup ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] a series of extant drawings show du ##rer ' s experiments in human proportion , leading to the famous engraving of " adam and eve " ( 150 ##4 ) , which shows his subtle ##ty while using the bu ##rin in the text ##uring of flesh surfaces . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the only existing engraving signed with his full name . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer created large numbers of preparatory drawings , especially for his paintings and engravings , and many survive , most famously the " bet ##end ##e hand ##e " ( " praying hands " ) from circa 150 ##8 , a study for an apostle in the heller altar ##piece . [SEP]
[CLS] he continued to make images in water ##col ##our and body ##col ##our ( usually combined ) , including a number of still life ##s of meadow sections or animals , including his " young hare " ( 150 ##2 ) and the " great piece of turf " ( 150 ##3 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in italy , he returned to painting , at first producing a series of works executed in temper ##a on linen . [SEP]
[CLS] these include portraits and altar ##piece ##s , notably , the pau ##mg ##art ##ner altar ##piece and the " ad ##oration of the mag ##i " . [SEP]
[CLS] in early 150 ##6 , he returned to venice and stayed there until the spring of 150 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] by this time du ##rer ' s engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied . [SEP]
[CLS] in venice he was given a valuable commission from the emi ##grant german community for the church of san bart ##olo ##meo . [SEP]
[CLS] this was the altar - piece known as the " ad ##oration of the virgin " or the " feast of rose garland ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] it includes portraits of members of venice ' s german community , but shows a strong italian influence . [SEP]
[CLS] it was subsequently acquired by the emperor rudolf ii and taken to prague . [SEP]
[CLS] other paintings du ##rer produced in venice include " the virgin and child with the gold ##fin ##ch " , " christ among the doctors " ( supposedly produced in a mere five days ) , and a number of smaller works . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the regard in which he was held by the venetian ##s , du ##rer returned to nuremberg by mid - 150 ##7 , remaining in germany until 152 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] his reputation had spread throughout europe and he was on friendly terms and in communication with most of the major artists including raphael , giovanni bell ##ini and — mainly through lorenzo di cr ##ed ##i — leonardo da vinci . [SEP]
[CLS] between 150 ##7 and 151 ##1 du ##rer worked on some of his most celebrated paintings : " adam and eve " ( 150 ##7 ) , " the martyr ##dom of the ten thousand " ( 150 ##8 , for frederick of saxony ) , " virgin with the iris " ( 150 ##8 ) , the altar ##piece " assumption of the virgin " ( 150 ##9 , for jacob heller of frankfurt ) , and " ad ##oration of the trinity " ( 151 ##1 , for matt ##hae ##us landau ##er ) . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period he also completed two wood ##cut series , the " great passion " and the " life of the virgin " , both published in 151 ##1 together with a second edition of the " apocalypse " series . [SEP]
[CLS] the post - venetian wood ##cut ##s show du ##rer ' s development of chi ##aro ##scu ##ro modelling effects , creating a mid - tone throughout the print to which the highlights and shadows can be contrasted . [SEP]
[CLS] other works from this period include the thirty - seven wood ##cut subjects of the " little passion " , published first in 151 ##1 , and a set of fifteen small engravings on the same theme in 151 ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , complaining that painting did not make enough money to justify the time spent when compared to his prints , he produced no paintings from 151 ##3 to 151 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in 151 ##3 and 151 ##4 du ##rer created his three most famous engravings : " knight , death , and the devil " ( 151 ##3 , probably based on erasmus ' s treatise " en ##chi ##rid ##ion mil ##itis christian ##i " ) , " st . jerome in his study " , and the much - debated " mel ##en ##col ##ia i " ( both 151 ##4 , the year du ##rer ' s mother died ) . [SEP]
[CLS] further outstanding pen and ink drawings of du ##rer ' s period of art work of 151 ##3 were drafts for his friend will ##iba ##ld pi ##rc ##kh ##eim ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] these drafts were later used to design the famous chan ##del ##iers lust ##er ##wei ##bc ##hen . [SEP]
[CLS] in 151 ##5 , he created his " wood ##cut of a rhino ##cer ##os " which had arrived in lisbon from a written description and sketch by another artist , without ever seeing the animal himself . [SEP]
[CLS] an image of the indian rhino ##cer ##os , the image has such force that it remains one of his best - known and was still used in some german school science text - books as late as last century . [SEP]
[CLS] in the years leading to 152 ##0 he produced a wide range of works , including the wood ##block ##s for the first western printed star charts in 151 ##5 and portraits in temper ##a on linen in 151 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] his only experiments with etc ##hing came in this period , producing five 151 ##5 – 151 ##6 and a sixth 151 ##8 ; a technique he may have abandoned as un ##suit ##ed to his aesthetic of method ##ical , classical form . [SEP]
[CLS] from 151 ##2 , maximilian i became du ##rer ' s major patron . [SEP]
[CLS] his commissions included " the triumph ##al arch " , a vast work printed from 192 separate blocks , the symbolism of which is partly informed by pi ##rc ##kh ##eim ##er ' s translation of ho ##ra ##pol ##lo ' s " hi ##ero ##gly ##phic ##a " . [SEP]
[CLS] the design program and explanations were devised by johannes stab ##ius , the architectural design by the master builder and court - painter jo ##rg ko ##lder ##er and the wood ##cut ##ting itself by hi ##eron ##ym ##ous andrea ##e , with du ##rer as designer - in - chief . [SEP]
[CLS] " the arch " was followed by " the triumph ##al procession " , the program of which was worked out in 151 ##2 by and includes wood ##cut ##s by albrecht alt ##dorf ##er and hans spring ##ink ##lee , as well as du ##rer . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer worked with pen on the marginal images for an edition of the emperor ' s printed prayer - book ; these were quite unknown until fa ##cs ##imi ##les were published in 1808 as part of the first book published in lit ##hog ##raphy . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer ' s work on the book was halted for an unknown reason , and the decoration was continued by artists including lucas cr ##ana ##ch the elder and hans bald ##ung . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer also made several portraits of the emperor , including one shortly before maximilian ' s death in 151 ##9 . [SEP]
[CLS] maximilian ' s death came at a time when du ##rer was concerned he was losing " my sight and freedom of hand " ( perhaps caused by arthritis ) and increasingly affected by the writings of martin luther . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 152 ##0 du ##rer made his fourth and last major journey , to renew the imperial pension maximilian had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor , charles v , who was to be crowned at aachen . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer journey ##ed with his wife and her maid via the rhine to cologne and then to antwerp , where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in silver ##point , chalk and charcoal . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to going to the coronation , he made excursion ##s to cologne ( where he admired the painting of stefan loch ##ner ) , ni ##jm ##ege ##n , ' s - her ##to ##gen ##bos ##ch , br ##uge ##s ( where he saw michelangelo ' s madonna of br ##uge ##s ) , ghent ( where he admired van e ##yck ' s altar ##piece ) , and zee ##land . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave , exchanged or sold them , and for how much . [SEP]
[CLS] this provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike paintings , their sale was very rarely documented . [SEP]
[CLS] while providing valuable documentary evidence , du ##rer ' s net ##her ##land ##ish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , du ##rer offered his last portrait of maximilian to his daughter , margaret of austria , but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after margaret disliked the portrait and declined to accept it . [SEP]
[CLS] during this trip he also met bernard van or ##ley , jan pro ##vo ##ost , gerard ho ##ren ##bo ##ut , jean mon ##e , joachim pat ##ini ##r and tom ##mas ##o vinci ##dor , though he did not , it seems , meet quentin mats ##ys . [SEP]
[CLS] at the request of christian ii of denmark , du ##rer went to brussels to paint the king ' s portrait . [SEP]
[CLS] there he saw " the things which have been sent to the king from the golden land " — the aztec treasure that her ##nan cortes had sent home to holy roman emperor charles v following the fall of mexico . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer wrote that this treasure " was much more beautiful to me than miracles . [SEP]
[CLS] these things are so precious that they have been valued at 100 , 000 fl ##orin ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer also appears to have been collecting for his own cabinet of cu ##rio ##sities , and he sent back to nuremberg various animal horns , a piece of coral , some large fish fins , and a wooden weapon from the east indies . [SEP]
[CLS] having secured his pension , du ##rer finally returned home in july 152 ##1 , having caught an und ##eter ##mined illness — perhaps malaria — which af ##flict ##ed him for the rest of his life , and greatly reduced his rate of work . [SEP]
[CLS] on his return to nuremberg , du ##rer worked on a number of grand projects with religious themes , including a cr ##uc ##if ##ix ##ion scene and a sac ##ra con ##vers ##azi ##one , though neither was completed . [SEP]
[CLS] this may have been due in part to his declining health , but perhaps also because of the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on geometry and perspective , the proportions of men and horses , and fortification . [SEP]
[CLS] however , one consequence of this shift in emphasis was that during the last years of his life , du ##rer produced comparatively little as an artist . [SEP]
[CLS] in painting , there was only a portrait of , a , , and two panels showing st . john with st . peter in and st . paul with st . mark in the . [SEP]
[CLS] this last great work , the four apostles , was given by du ##rer to the city of nuremberg — although he was given 100 guild ##ers in return . [SEP]
[CLS] as for engravings , du ##rer ' s work was restricted to portraits and illustrations for his treatise . [SEP]
[CLS] the portraits include cardinal - elector albert of mainz ; frederick the wise , elector of saxony ; the humanist scholar will ##iba ##ld pi ##rc ##kh ##eim ##er ; philipp mel ##an ##cht ##hon , and erasmus of rotterdam . [SEP]
[CLS] for those of the cardinal , mel ##an ##cht ##hon , and du ##rer ' s final major work , a drawn portrait of the nuremberg patricia ##n ulrich star ##ck , du ##rer depicted the sit ##ters in profile , perhaps reflecting a more mathematical approach . [SEP]
[CLS] despite complaining of his lack of a formal classical education , du ##rer was greatly interested in intellectual matters and learned much from his boy ##hood friend will ##iba ##ld pi ##rc ##kh ##eim ##er , whom he no doubt consulted on the content of many of his images . [SEP]
[CLS] he also derived great satisfaction from his friendships and correspondence with erasmus and other scholars . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer succeeded in producing two books during his lifetime . [SEP]
[CLS] " the four books on measurement " were published at nuremberg in 152 ##5 and was the first book for adults on mathematics in german , as well as being cited later by galileo and kepler . [SEP]
[CLS] the other , a work on city fortifications , was published in 152 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] " the four books on human proportion " were published posthumously , shortly after his death in 152 ##8 . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer died in nuremberg at the age of 56 , leaving an estate valued at 6 , 87 ##4 fl ##orin ##s – a considerable sum . [SEP]
[CLS] he is buried in the " johann ##is ##fr ##ied ##hof " cemetery . [SEP]
[CLS] his large house ( purchased in 150 ##9 from the heirs of the astronomer bernhard walt ##her ) , where his workshop was located and where his widow lived until her death in 153 ##9 , remains a prominent nuremberg landmark . [SEP]
[CLS] it is now a museum . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer ' s writings suggest that he may have been sympathetic to martin luther ' s ideas , though it is unclear if he ever left the catholic church . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer wrote of his desire to draw luther in his diary in 152 ##0 : " and god help me that i may go to dr . martin luther ; thus i intend to make a portrait of him with great care and eng ##rave him on a copper plate to create a lasting memorial of the christian man who helped me overcome so many difficulties . " [SEP]
[CLS] in a letter to nicholas k ##rat ##zer in 152 ##4 , du ##rer wrote " because of our christian faith we have to stand in sc ##orn and danger , for we are rev ##iled and called here ##tics " . [SEP]
[CLS] most telling ##ly , pi ##rc ##kh ##eim ##er wrote in a letter to johann ts ##cher ##te in 153 ##0 : " i confess that in the beginning i believed in luther , like our albert of blessed memory . . . but as anyone can see , the situation has become worse . " [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer may even have contributed to the nuremberg city council ' s man ##dating lutheran sermons and services in march 152 ##5 . [SEP]
[CLS] notably , du ##rer had contacts with various reformer ##s , such as z ##wing ##li , andreas karl ##stadt , mel ##an ##cht ##hon , erasmus and cornelius graph ##eus from whom du ##rer received luther ' s " babylonian captivity " in 152 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] from 152 ##5 , however , " the year that saw the peak and collapse of the peasants ' war , the artist can be seen to distance himself somewhat from the lutheran movement . . . " [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer ' s later works have also been claimed to show protestant sy ##mp ##athi ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , his wood ##cut of " the last supper " of 152 ##3 has often been understood to have an evangelical theme , focus ##sing as it does on christ es ##po ##using the gospel , as well the inclusion of the eu ##cha ##rist ##ic cup , an expression of protestant ut ##ra ##qui ##sm , although this interpretation has been questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] the delaying of the engraving of st philip , completed in 152 ##3 but not distributed until 152 ##6 , may have been due to du ##rer ' s une ##asi ##ness with images of saints ; even if du ##rer was not an icon ##oc ##las ##t , in his last years he evaluated and questioned the role of art in religion . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer ex ##erted a huge influence on the artists of succeeding generations , especially in print ##making , the medium through which his contemporaries mostly experienced his art , as his paintings were predominantly in private collections located in only a few cities . [SEP]
[CLS] his success in spreading his reputation across europe through prints was undoubtedly an inspiration for major artists such as raphael , ti ##tian , and par ##mi ##gia ##nin ##o , all of whom collaborated with print ##makers in order to promote and distribute their work . [SEP]
[CLS] his work in engraving seems to have had an intimidating effect upon his german successors , the " little masters " who attempted few large engravings but continued du ##rer ' s themes in small , rather cramped compositions . [SEP]
[CLS] lucas van ley ##den was the only northern european engraver to successfully continue to produce large engravings in the first third of the 16th century . [SEP]
[CLS] the generation of italian engraver ##s who trained in the shadow of du ##rer all either directly copied parts of his landscape backgrounds ( gi ##ulio camp ##ag ##no ##la , giovanni battista pal ##umb ##a , ben ##ede ##tto mont ##ag ##na and cr ##isto ##fan ##o robe ##tta ) , or whole prints ( marc ##anto ##nio rai ##mond ##i and ago ##sti ##no ve ##ne ##zia ##no ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , du ##rer ' s influence became less dominant after 151 ##5 , when marc ##anto ##nio perfect ##ed his new engraving style , which in turn travelled over the alps to dominate northern engraving also . [SEP]
[CLS] in painting , du ##rer had relatively little influence in italy , where probably only his altar ##piece in venice was seen , and his german successors were less effective in blending german and italian styles . [SEP]
[CLS] his intense and self - drama ##ti ##zing self - portraits have continued to have a strong influence up to the present , especially on painters in the 19th and 20th century who desired a more dramatic portrait style . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer has never fallen from critical favour , and there have been significant revival ##s of interest in his works in germany in the " du ##rer renaissance " of about 1570 to 1630 , in the early nineteenth century , and in german nationalism from 1870 to 1945 . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer ' s study of human proportions and the use of transformations to a coordinate grid to demonstrate facial variation inspired similar work by d ' arc ##y thompson in his book " on growth and form " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 149 ##8 , du ##rer painted a series of self - portraits , quite possibly the first examples of an artist depicting himself . [SEP]
[CLS] his 150 ##7 panel paintings of " adam and eve " are the first full - size nude ##s in northern european art . [SEP]
[CLS] the lutheran church remembers du ##rer as a great christian annually on 6 april , along with lucas cr ##ana ##ch the elder and hans bu ##rg ##km ##air . [SEP]
[CLS] the liturgical calendar of the episcopal church ( united states ) remembers him , cr ##ana ##ch and matthias gr ##une ##wald on 5 august . [SEP]
[CLS] in all his theoretical works , in order to communicate his theories in the german language rather than in latin , du ##rer used graphic expressions based on a vernacular , craftsmen ' s language . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , " sc ##hn ##eck ##en ##lini ##e " ( " snail - line " ) was his term for a spiral form . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , du ##rer contributed to the expansion in german prose which martin luther had begun with his translation of the bible . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer ' s work on geometry is called the " four books on measurement " ( " under ##we ##ys ##ung der mess ##ung mit dem z ##ir ##cke ##l und rich ##ts ##che ##yt " or " instructions for measuring with compass and ruler " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the first book focuses on linear geometry . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer ' s geometric constructions include he ##lices , con ##cho ##ids and epic ##y ##cl ##oids . [SEP]
[CLS] he also draws on apollo ##nius , and johannes werner ' s ' libel ##lus super vi ##gin ##ti duo ##bus element ##is con ##ici ##s ' of 152 ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the second book moves onto two dimensional geometry , i . e . the construction of regular poly ##gon ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] here du ##rer favour ##s the methods of ptolemy over eu ##cl ##id . [SEP]
[CLS] the third book applies these principles of geometry to architecture , engineering and ty ##po ##graphy . [SEP]
[CLS] in architecture du ##rer cites vi ##tr ##u ##vius but elaborate ##s his own classical designs and columns . [SEP]
[CLS] in ty ##po ##graphy , du ##rer depicts the geometric construction of the latin alphabet , relying on italian precedent . [SEP]
[CLS] however , his construction of the gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system . [SEP]
[CLS] the fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three - dimensional forms and the construction of poly ##hed ##ra . [SEP]
[CLS] here du ##rer discusses the five plato ##nic solids , as well as seven arch ##ime ##de ##an semi - regular solids , as well as several of his own invention . [SEP]
[CLS] in all these , du ##rer shows the objects as nets . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , du ##rer discusses the del ##ian problem and moves on to the ' con ##st ##ru ##zione leg ##itt ##ima ' , a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective . [SEP]
[CLS] it was in bologna that du ##rer was taught ( possibly by luca pac ##iol ##i or bram ##ante ) the principles of linear perspective , and evidently became familiar with the ' cost ##ru ##zione leg ##itt ##ima ' in a written description of these principles found only , at this time , in the unpublished treatise of pier ##o della francesca . [SEP]
[CLS] he was also familiar with the ' abbreviated construction ' as described by albert ##i and the geometric ##al construction of shadows , a technique of leonardo da vinci . [SEP]
[CLS] although du ##rer made no innovations in these areas , he is notable as the first northern european to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way , and with understanding of euclidean principles . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to these geometric ##al constructions , du ##rer discusses in this last book of " under ##we ##ys ##ung der mess ##ung " an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides wood ##cut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer ' s work on human proportions is called the " four books on human proportion " ( " vie ##r bu ##cher von men ##sch ##liche ##r proportion " ) of 152 ##8 . [SEP]
[CLS] the first book was mainly composed by 151 ##2 / 13 and completed by 152 ##3 , showing five differently constructed types of both male and female figures , all parts of the body expressed in fraction ##s of the total height . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer based these constructions on both vi ##tr ##u ##vius and empirical observations of " two to three hundred living persons " , in his own words . [SEP]
[CLS] the second book includes eight further types , broken down not into fraction ##s but an albert ##ian system , which du ##rer probably learned from francesco di giorgio ' s ' de harmonica mu ##ndi to ##tius ' of 152 ##5 . [SEP]
[CLS] in the third book , du ##rer gives principles by which the proportions of the figures can be modified , including the mathematical simulation of convex and con ##cave mirrors ; here du ##rer also deals with human ph ##ys ##io ##gno ##my . [SEP]
[CLS] the fourth book is devoted to the theory of movement . [SEP]
[CLS] app ##ended to the last book , however , is a self - contained essay on aesthetics , which du ##rer worked on between 151 ##2 and 152 ##8 , and it is here that we learn of his theories concerning ' ideal beauty ' . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer rejected albert ##i ' s concept of an objective beauty , proposing a re ##lat ##ivist notion of beauty based on variety . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , du ##rer still believed that truth was hidden within nature , and that there were rules which ordered beauty , even though he found it difficult to define the criteria for such a code . [SEP]
[CLS] in 151 ##2 / 13 his three criteria were function ( ' nut ##z ' ) , naive approval ( ' wo ##hl ##ge ##fall ##en ' ) and the happy medium ( ' mit ##tel ##mas ##s ' ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , unlike albert ##i and leonardo , du ##rer was most troubled by understanding not just the abstract notions of beauty but also as to how an artist can create beautiful images . [SEP]
[CLS] between 151 ##2 and the final draft in 152 ##8 , du ##rer ' s belief developed from an understanding of human creativity as spontaneous or inspired to a concept of ' selective inward synthesis ' . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , that an artist builds on a wealth of visual experiences in order to imagine beautiful things . [SEP]
[CLS] du ##rer ' s belief in the abilities of a single artist over inspiration prompted him to assert that " one man may sketch something with his pen on half a sheet of paper in one day , or may cut it into a tiny piece of wood with his little iron , and it turns out to be better and more artistic than another ' s work at which its author labour ##s with the utmost dil ##igen ##ce for a whole year " . [SEP]
[CLS] an important exhibition runs at the albert ##ina in vienna ( austria ) from 20 september 2019 to 6 january 2020 . [SEP]
[CLS] the albert ##ina has the largest collection in the world of du ##rer drawings with more than 140 works . [SEP]
[CLS] with loans , over 200 works will be exhibited . [SEP]
[CLS] other exhibitions inc ##lde : paris autumn - winter 2012 - 2013 exhibition " albrecht du ##rer and his time : from the reformation to the thirty years ' war " , from the collection of the beaux - arts de paris , october 24 , 2012 to january 13 , 2013 . [SEP]
[CLS] exhibition in liege , 25 march - 21 may 2011 , based on the collections of the university of liege . [SEP]
[CLS] the question of copies is also raised through a selection of engravings made by anonymous artists or by cop ##ists such as marc ##anto ##nio rai ##mond ##i ( 148 ##0 - 153 ##4 ) . [SEP]
