At the beginning of Stephen King's career, the general view among publishers was that an author was limited to one book per year, since publishing more would be unacceptable to the public.
In his introduction to "The Bachman Books," King states that adopting the nom de plume Bachman was also an attempt to make sense out of his career and try to answer the question of whether his success was due to talent or luck.
King concludes that he has yet to find an answer to the "talent versus luck" question, as he felt he was outed as Bachman too early to know.
The pseudonym King originally selected (Gus Pillsbury) is King's maternal grandfather's name, but at the last moment (due to the pseudonym being outed) King changed it to Richard Bachman.
(The surname Stark "was" later used in King's novel "The Dark Half," in which an author's malevolent pseudonym, "George Stark", comes to life.)
Bachman was inspired by Bachmanâ€“Turner Overdrive, a rock and roll band King was listening to at the time his publisher asked him to choose a pseudonym on the spot.
Known "facts" about Bachman were that he was born in New York, served a four-year stint in the Coast Guard, which he then followed with ten years in the Merchant Marine.
Bachman finally settled down in rural central New Hampshire, where he ran a medium-sized dairy farm, writing at night.
Other "facts" about the author were revealed in publicity dispatches from Bachman's publishers: the Bachmans had one child, a boy, who died in an unfortunate, Stephen King-ish type accident at the age of six, when he fell through a well and drowned.
After Bachman's true identity was revealed, later publicity dispatches (and "about the author" blurbs) revealed that Bachman died suddenly in late 1985 of "cancer of the pseudonym, a rare form of schizonomia".
The link between King and his shadow writer was exposed after a Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, noted similarities between the writing styles of King and Bachman.
Brown located publisher's records at the Library of Congress which included a document naming King as the author of one of Bachman's novels.
Brown wrote to King's publishers with a copy of the documents he had uncovered, and asked them what to do.
At the time of the announcement in 1985, King was working on "Misery," which he had planned to release as a Bachman book.
In 1987, the Bachman novel "The Running Man" inspired the Paul Michael Glaser film of the same name.
King insisted that his name not be on the credits, and the screen credit for the film went to Richard Bachman.
King used the "relationship" between himself and Bachman as a concept in his 1989 book "The Dark Half."
In 1996, Bachman's "The Regulators" came out, with the publishers claiming the book's manuscript was found among Bachman's leftover papers by his widow.
It was released as a companion novel with King's "Desperation"; the two novels took place in different universes but featured many of the same characters.
In the foreword by King included with "Desperation" he said that there may be another Bachman novel left to be "found."
"Blaze" was, in fact, an unpublished novel of King's written before "Carrie" or the creation of Richard Bachman.
King has taken full ownership of the Bachman name on numerous occasions, as with the republication of the first four Bachman titles as "The Bachman Books: Four Early Novels by Stephen King" in 1985.
(In 1996, the collection was reissued with a new King essay, "The Importance of Being Bachman".)
In the fifth book, "," the sinister children's book "Charlie the Choo Choo" is revealed to be written by "Claudia y Inez Bachman."
The spelling discrepancy of the added 'y' was later explained as a deus ex machina on the part of "The White" (a force of good throughout King's "Tower" series) to bring the total number of letters in her name to nineteen, a number prominent in King's series.
In the next novel of the series, "," Stephen King briefly discusses his Richard Bachman pseudonym.
In 2010, King appeared on the FX television show "Sons of Anarchy" in a cameo role.
In issue 29 of the comic adaptation of "The Stand", Richard (Rich) Bachman appears as one of the top lieutenants of Randall Flagg, replacing the character of Whitney Horgan from the original novel.
In the 2013 "Grimm" episode "Nameless", Richard Bachman being a pseudonym of Stephen King was a plot point.
