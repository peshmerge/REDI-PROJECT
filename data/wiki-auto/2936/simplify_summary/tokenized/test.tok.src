[CLS] due to the extremely rugged , mountainous nature of southeastern alaska , almost all communities ( with the exception of hyde ##r , ska ##g ##way , and hai ##nes ) have no road connections outside of their local ##e , so aircraft and boats are the major means of transport . [SEP]

[CLS] ship traffic in the area is seasonal ##ly busy with cruise ships . [SEP]
