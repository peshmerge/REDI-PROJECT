[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium " tre ##pone ##ma pal ##lid ##um " subspecies " pal ##lid ##um " . [SEP]
[CLS] the signs and symptoms of sy ##phi ##lis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents ( primary , secondary , late ##nt , and tertiary ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary stage classical ##ly presents with a single chan ##cre ( a firm , pain ##less , non - it ##chy skin ul ##cera ##tion usually between 1 cm and 2 cm in diameter ) though there may be multiple sore ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in secondary sy ##phi ##lis , a diffuse rash occurs , which frequently involves the palms of the hands and sole ##s of the feet . [SEP]
[CLS] there may also be sore ##s in the mouth or va ##gina . [SEP]
[CLS] in late ##nt sy ##phi ##lis , which can last for years , there are few or no symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] in tertiary sy ##phi ##lis , there are gum ##mas ( soft , non - cancer ##ous growth ##s ) , neurological problems , or heart symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis has been known as " the great im ##ita ##tor " as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis is most commonly spread through sexual activity . [SEP]
[CLS] it may also be transmitted from mother to baby during pregnancy or at birth , resulting in congenital sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] other diseases caused by the " tre ##pone ##ma " bacteria include ya ##ws ( subspecies " per ##ten ##ue " ) , pin ##ta ( subspecies " cara ##te ##um " ) , and non ##ven ##ere ##al endemic sy ##phi ##lis ( subspecies " endemic ##um " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these three diseases are not typically sexually transmitted . [SEP]
[CLS] diagnosis is usually made by using blood tests ; the bacteria can also be detected using dark field microscopy . [SEP]
[CLS] the centers for disease control and prevention ( u . s . ) recommend all pregnant women be tested . [SEP]
[CLS] the risk of sexual transmission of sy ##phi ##lis can be reduced by using a late ##x or poly ##ure ##than ##e condom . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis can be effectively treated with antibiotics . [SEP]
[CLS] the preferred anti ##biotic for most cases is benz ##athi ##ne benz ##yl ##pen ##ici ##llin injected into a muscle . [SEP]
[CLS] in those who have a severe pen ##ici ##llin all ##ergy , do ##xy ##cy ##cl ##ine or te ##tra ##cy ##cl ##ine may be used . [SEP]
[CLS] in those with ne ##uro ##sy ##phi ##lis , intra ##ven ##ous benz ##yl ##pen ##ici ##llin or ce ##ft ##ria ##xon ##e is recommended . [SEP]
[CLS] during treatment people may develop fever , headache , and muscle pains , a reaction known as jar ##isch - her ##x ##heimer . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2015 , about 45 . 4 million people were infected with sy ##phi ##lis , with 6 million new cases . [SEP]
[CLS] during 2015 , it caused about 107 , 000 deaths , down from 202 , 000 in 1990 . [SEP]
[CLS] after decreasing dramatically with the availability of pen ##ici ##llin in the 1940s , rates of infection have increased since the turn of the millennium in many countries , often in combination with human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus ( hiv ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this is believed to be partly due to increased prom ##is ##cuit ##y , prostitution , decreasing use of condoms , and unsafe sexual practices among men who have sex with men . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2015 , cuba became the first country to eliminate mother - to - child transmission of sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis can present in one of four different stages : primary , secondary , late ##nt , and tertiary , and may also occur congenital ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] it was referred to as " the great im ##ita ##tor " by sir william os ##ler due to its varied presentations . [SEP]
[CLS] primary sy ##phi ##lis is typically acquired by direct sexual contact with the infectious lesions of another person . [SEP]
[CLS] approximately 3 to 90 days after the initial exposure ( average 21 days ) a skin les ##ion , called a chan ##cre , appears at the point of contact . [SEP]
[CLS] this is classical ##ly ( 40 % of the time ) a single , firm , pain ##less , non - it ##chy skin ul ##cera ##tion with a clean base and sharp borders approximately 0 . 3 – 3 . 0 cm in size . [SEP]
[CLS] the les ##ion may take on almost any form . [SEP]
[CLS] in the classic form , it evolve ##s from a mac ##ule to a pa ##pu ##le and finally to an erosion or ul ##cer . [SEP]
[CLS] occasionally , multiple lesions may be present ( ~ 40 % ) , with multiple lesions being more common when coin ##fect ##ed with hiv . [SEP]
[CLS] lesions may be painful or tender ( 30 % ) , and they may occur in places other than the gen ##ital ##s ( 2 – 7 % ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common location in women is the ce ##r ##vi ##x ( 44 % ) , the penis in heterosexual men ( 99 % ) , and anal ##ly and rec ##tal ##ly in men who have sex with men ( 34 % ) . [SEP]
[CLS] l ##ym ##ph node en ##lar ##gement frequently ( 80 % ) occurs around the area of infection , occurring seven to 10 days after chan ##cre formation . [SEP]
[CLS] the les ##ion may persist for three to six weeks if left un ##tre ##ated . [SEP]
[CLS] secondary sy ##phi ##lis occurs approximately four to ten weeks after the primary infection . [SEP]
[CLS] while secondary disease is known for the many different ways it can manifest , symptoms most commonly involve the skin , mu ##cous membranes , and l ##ym ##ph nodes . [SEP]
[CLS] there may be a symmetrical , reddish - pink , non - it ##chy rash on the trunk and ex ##tre ##mit ##ies , including the palms and sole ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the rash may become mac ##ulo ##pa ##pu ##lar or pu ##st ##ular . [SEP]
[CLS] it may form flat , broad , whitish , war ##t - like lesions on mu ##cous membranes , known as con ##dy ##lom ##a la ##tum . [SEP]
[CLS] all of these lesions harbor bacteria and are infectious . [SEP]
[CLS] other symptoms may include fever , sore throat , mala ##ise , weight loss , hair loss , and headache . [SEP]
[CLS] rare manifestation ##s include liver inflammation , kidney disease , joint inflammation , per ##ios ##ti ##tis , inflammation of the optic nerve , uv ##eit ##is , and inter ##sti ##tial ke ##rat ##itis . [SEP]
[CLS] the acute symptoms usually resolve after three to six weeks ; about 25 % of people may present with a rec ##ur ##rence of secondary symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] many people who present with secondary sy ##phi ##lis ( 40 – 85 % of women , 20 – 65 % of men ) do not report previously having had the classical chan ##cre of primary sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] late ##nt sy ##phi ##lis is defined as having ser ##olo ##gic proof of infection without symptoms of disease . [SEP]
[CLS] it is further described as either early ( less than 1 year after secondary sy ##phi ##lis ) or late ( more than 1 year after secondary sy ##phi ##lis ) in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] the united kingdom uses a cut - off of two years for early and late late ##nt sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] early late ##nt sy ##phi ##lis may have a re ##la ##pse of symptoms in 25 % of cases . [SEP]
[CLS] late late ##nt sy ##phi ##lis is as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic , and not as con ##tag ##ious as early late ##nt sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] tertiary sy ##phi ##lis may occur approximately 3 to 15 years after the initial infection , and may be divided into three different forms : gum ##mat ##ous sy ##phi ##lis ( 15 % ) , late ne ##uro ##sy ##phi ##lis ( 6 . 5 % ) , and cardiovascular sy ##phi ##lis ( 10 % ) . [SEP]
[CLS] without treatment , a third of infected people develop tertiary disease . [SEP]
[CLS] people with tertiary sy ##phi ##lis are not infectious . [SEP]
[CLS] gum ##mat ##ous sy ##phi ##lis or late benign sy ##phi ##lis usually occurs 1 to 46 years after the initial infection , with an average of 15 years . [SEP]
[CLS] this stage is characterized by the formation of chronic gum ##mas , which are soft , tumor - like balls of inflammation which may vary considerably in size . [SEP]
[CLS] they typically affect the skin , bone , and liver , but can occur anywhere . [SEP]
[CLS] ne ##uro ##sy ##phi ##lis refers to an infection involving the central nervous system . [SEP]
[CLS] it may occur early , being either as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or in the form of sy ##phi ##lit ##ic men ##ing ##itis , or late as men ##ing ##ova ##scu ##lar sy ##phi ##lis , general par ##esis , or tab ##es dorsal ##is , which is associated with poor balance and lightning pains in the lower ex ##tre ##mit ##ies . [SEP]
[CLS] late ne ##uro ##sy ##phi ##lis typically occurs 4 to 25 years after the initial infection . [SEP]
[CLS] men ##ing ##ova ##scu ##lar sy ##phi ##lis typically presents with ap ##athy and seizures , and general par ##esis with dementia and tab ##es dorsal ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] also , there may be argyll robertson pupils , which are bilateral small pupils that con ##st ##ric ##t when the person focuses on near objects ( accommodation reflex ) but do not con ##st ##ric ##t when exposed to bright light ( pupil ##lary reflex ) . [SEP]
[CLS] cardiovascular sy ##phi ##lis usually occurs 10 – 30 years after the initial infection . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common com ##plication is sy ##phi ##lit ##ic ao ##rti ##tis , which may result in ao ##rti ##c an ##eur ##ys ##m formation . [SEP]
[CLS] congenital sy ##phi ##lis is that which is transmitted during pregnancy or during birth . [SEP]
[CLS] two - thirds of sy ##phi ##lit ##ic infants are born without symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] common symptoms that develop over the first couple of years of life include en ##lar ##gement of the liver and sp ##leen ( 70 % ) , rash ( 70 % ) , fever ( 40 % ) , ne ##uro ##sy ##phi ##lis ( 20 % ) , and lung inflammation ( 20 % ) . [SEP]
[CLS] if un ##tre ##ated , late congenital sy ##phi ##lis may occur in 40 % , including saddle nose deformation , hi ##go ##umen ##aki ##s sign , saber shin , or cl ##ut ##ton ' s joints among others . [SEP]
[CLS] infection during pregnancy is also associated with mis ##carriage . [SEP]
[CLS] the three main dental defects in congenital sy ##phi ##lis are hutchinson ' s inc ##iso ##rs ( screw ##drive ##r shaped inc ##iso ##rs ) , moon ' s mo ##lars or bud mo ##lars , and four ##nier ' s mo ##lars or mu ##lb ##erry mo ##lars ( mo ##lars with abnormal o ##cc ##lus ##al anatomy resembling a mu ##lb ##erry ) . [SEP]
[CLS] " tre ##pone ##ma pal ##lid ##um " subspecies " pal ##lid ##um " is a spiral - shaped , gram - negative , highly mobile bacterium . [SEP]
[CLS] three other human diseases are caused by related " tre ##pone ##ma pal ##lid ##um " subspecies , including ya ##ws ( subspecies " per ##ten ##ue " ) , pin ##ta ( subspecies " cara ##te ##um " ) and be ##je ##l ( subspecies " endemic ##um " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike subspecies " pal ##lid ##um " , they do not cause neurological disease . [SEP]
[CLS] humans are the only known natural reservoir for subspecies " pal ##lid ##um " . [SEP]
[CLS] it is unable to survive more than a few days without a host . [SEP]
[CLS] this is due to its small genome ( 1 . 14 ##mb ##p ) failing to en ##code the metabolic pathways necessary to make most of its macro ##nut ##rien ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] it has a slow doubling time of greater than 30 hours . [SEP]
[CLS] the bacterium is known for its ability to evade the immune system and its invasive ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis is transmitted primarily by sexual contact or during pregnancy from a mother to her baby ; the sp ##iro ##chet ##e is able to pass through intact mu ##cous membranes or compromised skin . [SEP]
[CLS] it is thus trans ##missible by kissing near a les ##ion , as well as oral , va ##ginal , and anal sex . [SEP]
[CLS] approximately 30 % to 60 % of those exposed to primary or secondary sy ##phi ##lis will get the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] its in ##fect ##ivity is exemplified by the fact that an individual in ##oc ##ulated with only 57 organisms has a 50 % chance of being infected . [SEP]
[CLS] most ( 60 % ) of new cases in the united states occur in men who have sex with men ; and in this population 20 % of sy ##phi ##lis were due to oral sex alone . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis can be transmitted by blood products , but the risk is low due to screening of donated blood in many countries . [SEP]
[CLS] the risk of transmission from sharing needles appears limited . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not generally possible to contract sy ##phi ##lis through toilet seats , daily activities , hot tub ##s , or sharing eating ut ##ens ##ils or clothing . [SEP]
[CLS] this is mainly because the bacteria die very quickly outside of the body , making transmission by objects extremely difficult . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis is difficult to dia ##gno ##se clinical ##ly during early infection . [SEP]
[CLS] confirmation is either via blood tests or direct visual inspection using dark field microscopy . [SEP]
[CLS] blood tests are more commonly used , as they are easier to perform . [SEP]
[CLS] diagnostic tests are unable to distinguish between the stages of the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] blood tests are divided into non ##tre ##pone ##mal and tre ##pone ##mal tests . [SEP]
[CLS] non ##tre ##pone ##mal tests are used initially , and include ve ##ner ##eal disease research laboratory ( v ##dr ##l ) and rapid plasma re ##agi ##n ( r ##pr ) tests . [SEP]
[CLS] false positive ##s on the non ##tre ##pone ##mal tests can occur with some viral infections , such as var ##ice ##lla ( chicken ##po ##x ) and me ##as ##les . [SEP]
[CLS] false positive ##s can also occur with l ##ym ##ph ##oma , tuberculosis , malaria , end ##oca ##rdi ##tis , connect ##ive tissue disease , and pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the possibility of false positive ##s with non ##tre ##pone ##mal tests , confirmation is required with a tre ##pone ##mal test , such as tre ##pone ##mal pal ##lid ##um particle ag ##gl ##uti ##nation ( t ##pha ) or fluorescent tre ##pone ##mal antibody absorption test ( ft ##a - abs ) . [SEP]
[CLS] tre ##pone ##mal antibody tests usually become positive two to five weeks after the initial infection . [SEP]
[CLS] ne ##uro ##sy ##phi ##lis is diagnosed by finding high numbers of le ##uk ##ocytes ( pre ##dom ##inate ##ly l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes ) and high protein levels in the ce ##re ##bro ##sp ##inal fluid in the setting of a known sy ##phi ##lis infection . [SEP]
[CLS] dark field microscopy of ser ##ous fluid from a chan ##cre may be used to make an immediate diagnosis . [SEP]
[CLS] hospitals do not always have equipment or experienced staff members , and testing must be done within 10 minutes of acquiring the sample . [SEP]
[CLS] sensitivity has been reported to be nearly 80 % ; therefore the test can only be used to confirm a diagnosis , not to rule one out . [SEP]
[CLS] two other tests can be carried out on a sample from the chan ##cre : direct fluorescent antibody ( d ##fa ) and polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) tests . [SEP]
[CLS] d ##fa uses antibodies tagged with flu ##ores ##ce ##in , which attach to specific sy ##phi ##lis proteins , while pc ##r uses techniques to detect the presence of specific sy ##phi ##lis genes . [SEP]
[CLS] these tests are not as time - sensitive , as they do not require living bacteria to make the diagnosis . [SEP]
[CLS] s of 2018 , there is no vaccine effective for prevention . [SEP]
[CLS] several vaccines based on tre ##pone ##mal proteins reduce les ##ion development in an animal model but research continues . [SEP]
[CLS] condom use reduces the likelihood of transmission during sex , but does not completely eliminate the risk . [SEP]
[CLS] the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) states , " correct and consistent use of late ##x condoms can reduce the risk of sy ##phi ##lis only when the infected area or site of potential exposure is protected . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a sy ##phi ##lis sore outside of the area covered by a late ##x condom can still allow transmission , so caution should be exercised even when using a condom . " [SEP]
[CLS] abs ##tine ##nce from intimate physical contact with an infected person is effective at reducing the transmission of sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] the cdc states , " the sure ##st way to avoid transmission of sexually transmitted diseases , including sy ##phi ##lis , is to abs ##tain from sexual contact or to be in a long - term mutually mono ##gam ##ous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is known to be un ##in ##fect ##ed . " [SEP]
[CLS] congenital sy ##phi ##lis in the newborn can be prevented by screening mothers during early pregnancy and treating those who are infected . [SEP]
[CLS] the united states prevent ##ive services task force ( us ##ps ##tf ) strongly recommends universal screening of all pregnant women , while the world health organization ( who ) recommends all women be tested at their first ant ##ena ##tal visit and again in the third trim ##ester . [SEP]
[CLS] if they are positive , it is recommend their partners also be treated . [SEP]
[CLS] congenital sy ##phi ##lis is still common in the developing world , as many women do not receive ant ##ena ##tal care at all , and the ant ##ena ##tal care others receive does not include screening . [SEP]
[CLS] it still occasionally occurs in the developed world , as those most likely to acquire sy ##phi ##lis are least likely to receive care during pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] several measures to increase access to testing appear effective at reducing rates of congenital sy ##phi ##lis in low - to middle - income countries . [SEP]
[CLS] point - of - care testing to detect sy ##phi ##lis appeared to be reliable although more research is needed to assess its effectiveness and into improving outcomes in mothers and babies . [SEP]
[CLS] the cdc recommends that sexually active men who have sex with men be tested at least yearly . [SEP]
[CLS] the us ##ps ##tf also recommends screening among those at high risk . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis is a not ##if ##iable disease in many countries , including canada the european union , and the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] this means health care providers are required to not ##ify public health authorities , which will then ideally provide partner notification to the person ' s partners . [SEP]
[CLS] physicians may also encourage patients to send their partners to seek care . [SEP]
[CLS] several strategies have been found to improve follow - up for st ##i testing , including email and text messaging of reminder ##s for appointments . [SEP]
[CLS] the first - line treatment for un ##com ##pl ##icated sy ##phi ##lis remains a single dose of intra ##mus ##cular benz ##athi ##ne benz ##yl ##pen ##ici ##llin . [SEP]
[CLS] do ##xy ##cy ##cl ##ine and te ##tra ##cy ##cl ##ine are alternative choices for those allergic to pen ##ici ##llin ; due to the risk of birth defects , these are not recommended for pregnant women . [SEP]
[CLS] resistance to macro ##lide ##s , ri ##fa ##mp ##ici ##n , and cl ##inda ##my ##cin is often present . [SEP]
[CLS] ce ##ft ##ria ##xon ##e , a third - generation ce ##pha ##los ##por ##in anti ##biotic , may be as effective as pen ##ici ##llin - based treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] it is recommended that a treated person avoid sex until the sore ##s are healed . [SEP]
[CLS] for ne ##uro ##sy ##phi ##lis , due to the poor penetration of benz ##athi ##ne pen ##ici ##llin into the central nervous system , those affected are given large doses of intra ##ven ##ous pen ##ici ##llin for a minimum of 10 days . [SEP]
[CLS] if a person is allergic to pen ##ici ##llin , ce ##ft ##ria ##xon ##e may be used or pen ##ici ##llin des ##ens ##iti ##zation attempted . [SEP]
[CLS] other late presentations may be treated with once - weekly intra ##mus ##cular benz ##athi ##ne pen ##ici ##llin for three weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment at this stage solely limits further progression of the disease and has a limited effect on damage which has already occurred . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the potential side effects of treatment is the jar ##isch - her ##x ##heimer reaction . [SEP]
[CLS] it frequently starts within one hour and lasts for 24 hours , with symptoms of fever , muscle pains , headache , and a fast heart rate . [SEP]
[CLS] it is caused by cy ##tok ##ines released by the immune system in response to lip ##op ##rot ##ein ##s released from ru ##pt ##uring sy ##phi ##lis bacteria . [SEP]
[CLS] pen ##ici ##llin is an effective treatment for sy ##phi ##lis in pregnancy but there is no agreement on which dose or route of delivery is most effective . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2012 , about 0 . 5 % of adults were infected with sy ##phi ##lis , with 6 million new cases . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1999 , it is believed to have infected 12 million additional people , with greater than 90 % of cases in the developing world . [SEP]
[CLS] it affects between 700 , 000 and 1 . 6 million pre ##gnan ##cies a year , resulting in spontaneous abortion ##s , still ##bir ##ths , and congenital sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] during 2015 , it caused about 107 , 000 deaths , down from 202 , 000 in 1990 . [SEP]
[CLS] in sub - saharan africa , sy ##phi ##lis contributes to approximately 20 % of per ##ina ##tal deaths . [SEP]
[CLS] rates are proportional ##ly higher among intra ##ven ##ous drug users , those who are infected with hiv , and men who have sex with men . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states about 55 , 400 people are newly infected each year . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , rates of sy ##phi ##lis as of 2007 were six times greater in men than in women ; they were nearly equal ten years earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] african americans accounted for almost half of all cases in 2010 . [SEP]
[CLS] as of 2014 , sy ##phi ##lis infections continue to increase in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis was very common in europe during the 18th and 19th centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] fl ##au ##bert found it universal among nineteenth - century egyptian prostitutes . [SEP]
[CLS] in the developed world during the early 20th century , infections declined rapidly with the widespread use of antibiotics , until the 1980s and 1990s . [SEP]
[CLS] since 2000 , rates of sy ##phi ##lis have been increasing in the us , canada , the uk , australia and europe , primarily among men who have sex with men . [SEP]
[CLS] rates of sy ##phi ##lis among us women have remained stable during this time , while rates among uk women have increased , but at a rate less than that of men . [SEP]
[CLS] increased rates among heterosexual ##s have occurred in china and russia since the 1990s . [SEP]
[CLS] this has been attributed to unsafe sexual practices , such as sexual prom ##is ##cuit ##y , prostitution , and decreasing use of barrier protection . [SEP]
[CLS] left un ##tre ##ated , it has a mortality rate of 8 % to 58 % , with a greater death rate among males . [SEP]
[CLS] the symptoms of sy ##phi ##lis have become less severe over the 19th and 20th centuries , in part due to widespread availability of effective treatment , and partly due to vi ##ru ##lence of the bacteria . [SEP]
[CLS] with early treatment , few complications result . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis increases the risk of hiv transmission by two to five times , and coin ##fect ##ion is common ( 30 – 60 % in some urban centers ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2015 , cuba became the first country in the world to era ##dicate mother to child transmission of sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] the origin of sy ##phi ##lis is disputed . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis was present in the americas before european contact , and it may have been carried from the americas to europe by the returning crew ##men from christopher columbus ' s voyage to the americas , or it may have existed in europe previously but gone un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed until shortly after columbus ’ s return . [SEP]
[CLS] these are the " columbian " and " pre - columbian " h ##yp ##oth ##eses , respectively , with the " columbian " hypothesis better supported by the evidence . [SEP]
[CLS] the first written records of an outbreak of sy ##phi ##lis in europe occurred in 149 ##4 or 149 ##5 in naples , italy , during a french invasion ( italian war of 149 ##4 – 98 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] since it was claimed to have been spread by french troops , it was initially called the " french disease " by the people of naples . [SEP]
[CLS] in 153 ##0 , the pastoral name " sy ##phi ##lis " ( the name of a character ) was first used by the italian physician and poet giro ##lam ##o fra ##cast ##oro as the title of his latin poem in da ##ct ##yl ##ic he ##xa ##meter describing the ra ##va ##ges of the disease in italy . [SEP]
[CLS] it was also called the " great po ##x " . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 16th through 19th centuries , sy ##phi ##lis was one of the largest public health burden ##s in prevalence , symptoms , and disability , although records of its true prevalence were generally not kept because of the fears ##ome and so ##rdi ##d status of sexually transmitted diseases in those centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time the ca ##usa ##tive agent was unknown but it was well known that it was spread sexually and also often from mother to child . [SEP]
[CLS] its association with sex , especially sexual prom ##is ##cuit ##y and prostitution , made it an object of fear and rev ##ulsion and a taboo . [SEP]
[CLS] the magnitude of its mor ##bid ##ity and mortality in those centuries reflected that , unlike today , there was no adequate understanding of its pathogen ##esis and no truly effective treatments . [SEP]
[CLS] its damage was caused not so much by great sickness or death early in the course of the disease but rather by its gr ##ues ##ome effects decades after infection as it progressed to ne ##uro ##sy ##phi ##lis with tab ##es dorsal ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] the ca ##usa ##tive organism , " tre ##pone ##ma pal ##lid ##um " , was first identified by fritz sc ##ha ##udi ##nn and erich hoffmann , in 1905 . [SEP]
[CLS] the first effective treatment for sy ##phi ##lis was sal ##var ##san , developed in 1910 by paul eh ##rl ##ich . [SEP]
[CLS] the effectiveness of treatment with pen ##ici ##llin was confirmed in trials in 1943 . [SEP]
[CLS] before the discovery and use of antibiotics in the mid - twentieth century , mercury and isolation were commonly used , with treatments often worse than the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 20th century , as both micro ##biology and ph ##arm ##aco ##logy advanced greatly , sy ##phi ##lis , like many other infectious diseases , became more of a manage ##able burden than a scary and di ##sf ##ig ##uring mystery , at least in developed countries among those people who could afford to pay for timely diagnosis and treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] pencil ##lin was discovered in 1928 , and from 1943 , it was the main treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] many famous historical figures , including franz schubert , arthur sc ##hope ##nh ##auer , edouard mane ##t , charles ba ##ude ##lai ##re , and guy de ma ##up ##ass ##ant are believed to have had the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] friedrich nietzsche was long believed to have gone mad as a result of tertiary sy ##phi ##lis , but that diagnosis has recently come into question . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been proposed that this was a posthumous sm ##ear campaign by anti - nazis . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest known depiction of an individual with sy ##phi ##lis is albrecht du ##rer ' s " sy ##phi ##lit ##ic man " , a wood ##cut believed to represent a lands ##k ##ne ##cht , a northern european mercenary . [SEP]
[CLS] the myth of the " femme fatal ##e " or " poison women " of the 19th century is believed to be partly derived from the devastation of sy ##phi ##lis , with classic examples in literature including john ke ##ats ' " la belle dame sans mer ##ci " . [SEP]
[CLS] the artist jan van der st ##rae ##t painted " preparation and use of gu ##aya ##co for treating sy ##phi ##lis " , a scene of a wealthy man receiving treatment for sy ##phi ##lis with the tropical wood gu ##aia ##cum sometime around 1580 . [SEP]
[CLS] the tu ##ske ##gee study of un ##tre ##ated sy ##phi ##lis in the negro male " was an infamous , une ##thic ##al , and racist clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the u . s . public health service . [SEP]
[CLS] the purpose of this study was to observe the natural history of un ##tre ##ated sy ##phi ##lis ; the african - american men in the study were told they were receiving free health care from the united states government . [SEP]
[CLS] the public health service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with tu ##ske ##gee university , a historically black college in alabama . [SEP]
[CLS] investigators enrolled in the study a total of 600 impoverished , african - american share ##cr ##op ##pers from macon county , alabama . [SEP]
[CLS] of these men , 39 ##9 had previously contracted sy ##phi ##lis before the study began , and 201 did not have the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] the men were given free medical care , meals , and free burial insurance for participating in the study . [SEP]
[CLS] the men were told that the study was only going to last six months , but it actually lasted 40 years . [SEP]
[CLS] after funding for treatment was lost , the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated . [SEP]
[CLS] none of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease , and none were treated with pen ##ici ##llin even after the anti ##biotic was proven to successfully treat sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the centers for disease control , the men were told that they were being treated for " bad blood " , a col ##lo ##qui ##alis ##m that described various conditions such as sy ##phi ##lis , an ##emia , and fatigue . [SEP]
[CLS] " bad blood " — specifically the collection of illnesses the term included — was a leading cause of death within the southern african - american community . [SEP]
