[CLS] the signs and symptoms of sy ##phi ##lis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents ( primary , secondary , late ##nt , and tertiary ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary stage classical ##ly presents with a single chan ##cre ( a firm , pain ##less , non - it ##chy skin ul ##cera ##tion usually between 1 cm and 2 cm in diameter ) though there may be multiple sore ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in secondary sy ##phi ##lis , a diffuse rash occurs , which frequently involves the palms of the hands and sole ##s of the feet . [SEP]
[CLS] in late ##nt sy ##phi ##lis , which can last for years , there are few or no symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis has been known as " the great im ##ita ##tor " as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases . [SEP]
[CLS] the risk of sexual transmission of sy ##phi ##lis can be reduced by using a late ##x or poly ##ure ##than ##e condom . [SEP]
[CLS] in those who have a severe pen ##ici ##llin all ##ergy , do ##xy ##cy ##cl ##ine or te ##tra ##cy ##cl ##ine may be used . [SEP]
[CLS] during treatment people may develop fever , headache , and muscle pains , a reaction known as jar ##isch - her ##x ##heimer . [SEP]
[CLS] after decreasing dramatically with the availability of pen ##ici ##llin in the 1940s , rates of infection have increased since the turn of the millennium in many countries , often in combination with human im ##mun ##ode ##fi ##ciency virus ( hiv ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this is believed to be partly due to increased prom ##is ##cuit ##y , prostitution , decreasing use of condoms , and unsafe sexual practices among men who have sex with men . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2015 , cuba became the first country to eliminate mother - to - child transmission of sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis can present in one of four different stages : primary , secondary , late ##nt , and tertiary , and may also occur congenital ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] primary sy ##phi ##lis is typically acquired by direct sexual contact with the infectious lesions of another person . [SEP]
[CLS] approximately 3 to 90 days after the initial exposure ( average 21 days ) a skin les ##ion , called a chan ##cre , appears at the point of contact . [SEP]
[CLS] this is classical ##ly ( 40 % of the time ) a single , firm , pain ##less , non - it ##chy skin ul ##cera ##tion with a clean base and sharp borders approximately 0 . 3 – 3 . 0 cm in size . [SEP]
[CLS] in the classic form , it evolve ##s from a mac ##ule to a pa ##pu ##le and finally to an erosion or ul ##cer . [SEP]
[CLS] occasionally , multiple lesions may be present ( ~ 40 % ) , with multiple lesions being more common when coin ##fect ##ed with hiv . [SEP]
[CLS] lesions may be painful or tender ( 30 % ) , and they may occur in places other than the gen ##ital ##s ( 2 – 7 % ) . [SEP]
[CLS] l ##ym ##ph node en ##lar ##gement frequently ( 80 % ) occurs around the area of infection , occurring seven to 10 days after chan ##cre formation . [SEP]
[CLS] while secondary disease is known for the many different ways it can manifest , symptoms most commonly involve the skin , mu ##cous membranes , and l ##ym ##ph nodes . [SEP]
[CLS] there may be a symmetrical , reddish - pink , non - it ##chy rash on the trunk and ex ##tre ##mit ##ies , including the palms and sole ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] all of these lesions harbor bacteria and are infectious . [SEP]
[CLS] the acute symptoms usually resolve after three to six weeks ; about 25 % of people may present with a rec ##ur ##rence of secondary symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] many people who present with secondary sy ##phi ##lis ( 40 – 85 % of women , 20 – 65 % of men ) do not report previously having had the classical chan ##cre of primary sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] late ##nt sy ##phi ##lis is defined as having ser ##olo ##gic proof of infection without symptoms of disease . [SEP]
[CLS] it is further described as either early ( less than 1 year after secondary sy ##phi ##lis ) or late ( more than 1 year after secondary sy ##phi ##lis ) in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] the united kingdom uses a cut - off of two years for early and late late ##nt sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] tertiary sy ##phi ##lis may occur approximately 3 to 15 years after the initial infection , and may be divided into three different forms : gum ##mat ##ous sy ##phi ##lis ( 15 % ) , late ne ##uro ##sy ##phi ##lis ( 6 . 5 % ) , and cardiovascular sy ##phi ##lis ( 10 % ) . [SEP]
[CLS] gum ##mat ##ous sy ##phi ##lis or late benign sy ##phi ##lis usually occurs 1 to 46 years after the initial infection , with an average of 15 years . [SEP]
[CLS] they typically affect the skin , bone , and liver , but can occur anywhere . [SEP]
[CLS] it may occur early , being either as ##ym ##pt ##oma ##tic or in the form of sy ##phi ##lit ##ic men ##ing ##itis , or late as men ##ing ##ova ##scu ##lar sy ##phi ##lis , general par ##esis , or tab ##es dorsal ##is , which is associated with poor balance and lightning pains in the lower ex ##tre ##mit ##ies . [SEP]
[CLS] late ne ##uro ##sy ##phi ##lis typically occurs 4 to 25 years after the initial infection . [SEP]
[CLS] men ##ing ##ova ##scu ##lar sy ##phi ##lis typically presents with ap ##athy and seizures , and general par ##esis with dementia and tab ##es dorsal ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] also , there may be argyll robertson pupils , which are bilateral small pupils that con ##st ##ric ##t when the person focuses on near objects ( accommodation reflex ) but do not con ##st ##ric ##t when exposed to bright light ( pupil ##lary reflex ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this is due to its small genome ( 1 . 14 ##mb ##p ) failing to en ##code the metabolic pathways necessary to make most of its macro ##nut ##rien ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis is transmitted primarily by sexual contact or during pregnancy from a mother to her baby ; the sp ##iro ##chet ##e is able to pass through intact mu ##cous membranes or compromised skin . [SEP]
[CLS] most ( 60 % ) of new cases in the united states occur in men who have sex with men ; and in this population 20 % of sy ##phi ##lis were due to oral sex alone . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis can be transmitted by blood products , but the risk is low due to screening of donated blood in many countries . [SEP]
[CLS] this is mainly because the bacteria die very quickly outside of the body , making transmission by objects extremely difficult . [SEP]
[CLS] confirmation is either via blood tests or direct visual inspection using dark field microscopy . [SEP]
[CLS] false positive ##s on the non ##tre ##pone ##mal tests can occur with some viral infections , such as var ##ice ##lla ( chicken ##po ##x ) and me ##as ##les . [SEP]
[CLS] because of the possibility of false positive ##s with non ##tre ##pone ##mal tests , confirmation is required with a tre ##pone ##mal test , such as tre ##pone ##mal pal ##lid ##um particle ag ##gl ##uti ##nation ( t ##pha ) or fluorescent tre ##pone ##mal antibody absorption test ( ft ##a - abs ) . [SEP]
[CLS] tre ##pone ##mal antibody tests usually become positive two to five weeks after the initial infection . [SEP]
[CLS] ne ##uro ##sy ##phi ##lis is diagnosed by finding high numbers of le ##uk ##ocytes ( pre ##dom ##inate ##ly l ##ym ##ph ##ocytes ) and high protein levels in the ce ##re ##bro ##sp ##inal fluid in the setting of a known sy ##phi ##lis infection . [SEP]
[CLS] hospitals do not always have equipment or experienced staff members , and testing must be done within 10 minutes of acquiring the sample . [SEP]
[CLS] sensitivity has been reported to be nearly 80 % ; therefore the test can only be used to confirm a diagnosis , not to rule one out . [SEP]
[CLS] two other tests can be carried out on a sample from the chan ##cre : direct fluorescent antibody ( d ##fa ) and polymer ##ase chain reaction ( pc ##r ) tests . [SEP]
[CLS] condom use reduces the likelihood of transmission during sex , but does not completely eliminate the risk . [SEP]
[CLS] the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) states , " correct and consistent use of late ##x condoms can reduce the risk of sy ##phi ##lis only when the infected area or site of potential exposure is protected . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a sy ##phi ##lis sore outside of the area covered by a late ##x condom can still allow transmission , so caution should be exercised even when using a condom . " [SEP]
[CLS] abs ##tine ##nce from intimate physical contact with an infected person is effective at reducing the transmission of sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] the cdc states , " the sure ##st way to avoid transmission of sexually transmitted diseases , including sy ##phi ##lis , is to abs ##tain from sexual contact or to be in a long - term mutually mono ##gam ##ous relationship with a partner who has been tested and is known to be un ##in ##fect ##ed . " [SEP]
[CLS] the united states prevent ##ive services task force ( us ##ps ##tf ) strongly recommends universal screening of all pregnant women , while the world health organization ( who ) recommends all women be tested at their first ant ##ena ##tal visit and again in the third trim ##ester . [SEP]
[CLS] congenital sy ##phi ##lis is still common in the developing world , as many women do not receive ant ##ena ##tal care at all , and the ant ##ena ##tal care others receive does not include screening . [SEP]
[CLS] several measures to increase access to testing appear effective at reducing rates of congenital sy ##phi ##lis in low - to middle - income countries . [SEP]
[CLS] point - of - care testing to detect sy ##phi ##lis appeared to be reliable although more research is needed to assess its effectiveness and into improving outcomes in mothers and babies . [SEP]
[CLS] this means health care providers are required to not ##ify public health authorities , which will then ideally provide partner notification to the person ' s partners . [SEP]
[CLS] physicians may also encourage patients to send their partners to seek care . [SEP]
[CLS] several strategies have been found to improve follow - up for st ##i testing , including email and text messaging of reminder ##s for appointments . [SEP]
[CLS] do ##xy ##cy ##cl ##ine and te ##tra ##cy ##cl ##ine are alternative choices for those allergic to pen ##ici ##llin ; due to the risk of birth defects , these are not recommended for pregnant women . [SEP]
[CLS] for ne ##uro ##sy ##phi ##lis , due to the poor penetration of benz ##athi ##ne pen ##ici ##llin into the central nervous system , those affected are given large doses of intra ##ven ##ous pen ##ici ##llin for a minimum of 10 days . [SEP]
[CLS] if a person is allergic to pen ##ici ##llin , ce ##ft ##ria ##xon ##e may be used or pen ##ici ##llin des ##ens ##iti ##zation attempted . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment at this stage solely limits further progression of the disease and has a limited effect on damage which has already occurred . [SEP]
[CLS] it frequently starts within one hour and lasts for 24 hours , with symptoms of fever , muscle pains , headache , and a fast heart rate . [SEP]
[CLS] it is caused by cy ##tok ##ines released by the immune system in response to lip ##op ##rot ##ein ##s released from ru ##pt ##uring sy ##phi ##lis bacteria . [SEP]
[CLS] pen ##ici ##llin is an effective treatment for sy ##phi ##lis in pregnancy but there is no agreement on which dose or route of delivery is most effective . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1999 , it is believed to have infected 12 million additional people , with greater than 90 % of cases in the developing world . [SEP]
[CLS] rates are proportional ##ly higher among intra ##ven ##ous drug users , those who are infected with hiv , and men who have sex with men . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , rates of sy ##phi ##lis as of 2007 were six times greater in men than in women ; they were nearly equal ten years earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis was very common in europe during the 18th and 19th centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] in the developed world during the early 20th century , infections declined rapidly with the widespread use of antibiotics , until the 1980s and 1990s . [SEP]
[CLS] since 2000 , rates of sy ##phi ##lis have been increasing in the us , canada , the uk , australia and europe , primarily among men who have sex with men . [SEP]
[CLS] rates of sy ##phi ##lis among us women have remained stable during this time , while rates among uk women have increased , but at a rate less than that of men . [SEP]
[CLS] the symptoms of sy ##phi ##lis have become less severe over the 19th and 20th centuries , in part due to widespread availability of effective treatment , and partly due to vi ##ru ##lence of the bacteria . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2015 , cuba became the first country in the world to era ##dicate mother to child transmission of sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] sy ##phi ##lis was present in the americas before european contact , and it may have been carried from the americas to europe by the returning crew ##men from christopher columbus ' s voyage to the americas , or it may have existed in europe previously but gone un ##re ##co ##gni ##zed until shortly after columbus ’ s return . [SEP]
[CLS] since it was claimed to have been spread by french troops , it was initially called the " french disease " by the people of naples . [SEP]
[CLS] in 153 ##0 , the pastoral name " sy ##phi ##lis " ( the name of a character ) was first used by the italian physician and poet giro ##lam ##o fra ##cast ##oro as the title of his latin poem in da ##ct ##yl ##ic he ##xa ##meter describing the ra ##va ##ges of the disease in italy . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 16th through 19th centuries , sy ##phi ##lis was one of the largest public health burden ##s in prevalence , symptoms , and disability , although records of its true prevalence were generally not kept because of the fears ##ome and so ##rdi ##d status of sexually transmitted diseases in those centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] its association with sex , especially sexual prom ##is ##cuit ##y and prostitution , made it an object of fear and rev ##ulsion and a taboo . [SEP]
[CLS] the magnitude of its mor ##bid ##ity and mortality in those centuries reflected that , unlike today , there was no adequate understanding of its pathogen ##esis and no truly effective treatments . [SEP]
[CLS] its damage was caused not so much by great sickness or death early in the course of the disease but rather by its gr ##ues ##ome effects decades after infection as it progressed to ne ##uro ##sy ##phi ##lis with tab ##es dorsal ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] the first effective treatment for sy ##phi ##lis was sal ##var ##san , developed in 1910 by paul eh ##rl ##ich . [SEP]
[CLS] before the discovery and use of antibiotics in the mid - twentieth century , mercury and isolation were commonly used , with treatments often worse than the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 20th century , as both micro ##biology and ph ##arm ##aco ##logy advanced greatly , sy ##phi ##lis , like many other infectious diseases , became more of a manage ##able burden than a scary and di ##sf ##ig ##uring mystery , at least in developed countries among those people who could afford to pay for timely diagnosis and treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] many famous historical figures , including franz schubert , arthur sc ##hope ##nh ##auer , edouard mane ##t , charles ba ##ude ##lai ##re , and guy de ma ##up ##ass ##ant are believed to have had the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] friedrich nietzsche was long believed to have gone mad as a result of tertiary sy ##phi ##lis , but that diagnosis has recently come into question . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest known depiction of an individual with sy ##phi ##lis is albrecht du ##rer ' s " sy ##phi ##lit ##ic man " , a wood ##cut believed to represent a lands ##k ##ne ##cht , a northern european mercenary . [SEP]
[CLS] the myth of the " femme fatal ##e " or " poison women " of the 19th century is believed to be partly derived from the devastation of sy ##phi ##lis , with classic examples in literature including john ke ##ats ' " la belle dame sans mer ##ci " . [SEP]
[CLS] the artist jan van der st ##rae ##t painted " preparation and use of gu ##aya ##co for treating sy ##phi ##lis " , a scene of a wealthy man receiving treatment for sy ##phi ##lis with the tropical wood gu ##aia ##cum sometime around 1580 . [SEP]
[CLS] the tu ##ske ##gee study of un ##tre ##ated sy ##phi ##lis in the negro male " was an infamous , une ##thic ##al , and racist clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the u . s . public health service . [SEP]
[CLS] the purpose of this study was to observe the natural history of un ##tre ##ated sy ##phi ##lis ; the african - american men in the study were told they were receiving free health care from the united states government . [SEP]
[CLS] the public health service started working on this study in 1932 in collaboration with tu ##ske ##gee university , a historically black college in alabama . [SEP]
[CLS] investigators enrolled in the study a total of 600 impoverished , african - american share ##cr ##op ##pers from macon county , alabama . [SEP]
[CLS] of these men , 39 ##9 had previously contracted sy ##phi ##lis before the study began , and 201 did not have the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] the men were given free medical care , meals , and free burial insurance for participating in the study . [SEP]
[CLS] after funding for treatment was lost , the study was continued without informing the men that they would never be treated . [SEP]
[CLS] none of the men infected were ever told that they had the disease , and none were treated with pen ##ici ##llin even after the anti ##biotic was proven to successfully treat sy ##phi ##lis . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the centers for disease control , the men were told that they were being treated for " bad blood " , a col ##lo ##qui ##alis ##m that described various conditions such as sy ##phi ##lis , an ##emia , and fatigue . [SEP]
[CLS] researchers knowing ##ly failed to treat patients appropriately after the 1940s validation of pen ##ici ##llin was found as an effective cure for the disease that they were studying . [SEP]
[CLS] the revelation in 1972 of study failures by a whistle ##bl ##ower , peter bu ##xt ##un , led to major changes in u . s . law and regulation on the protection of participants in clinical studies . [SEP]
[CLS] it was done during the administration of american president harry s . truman and guatemala ##n president juan jose are ##val ##o with the cooperation of some guatemala ##n health ministries and officials . [SEP]
[CLS] doctors infected soldiers , prostitutes , prisoners and mental patients with sy ##phi ##lis and other sexually transmitted diseases , without the informed consent of the subjects , and treated most subjects with antibiotics . [SEP]
[CLS] clinton and se ##bel ##ius stated " although these events occurred more than 64 years ago , we are outraged that such rep ##re ##hen ##sible research could have occurred under the guise of public health . [SEP]
[CLS] we deeply regret that it happened , and we apologize to all the individuals who were affected by such ab ##hor ##rent research practices . " [SEP]
