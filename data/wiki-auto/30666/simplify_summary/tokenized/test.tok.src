[CLS] et ##ym ##ological ##ly , the latin word tri ##vi ##um means " the place where three roads meet " ( tri + via ) ; hence , the subjects of the tri ##vi ##um are the foundation for the quad ##ri ##vi ##um , the upper division of the medieval education in the liberal arts , which comprised arithmetic ( numbers as abstract concepts ) , geometry ( numbers in space ) , music ( numbers in time ) , and astronomy ( numbers in space and time ) . [SEP]
[CLS] educational ##ly , the tri ##vi ##um and the quad ##ri ##vi ##um imp ##arte ##d to the student the seven liberal arts of classical antiquity . [SEP]
[CLS] grammar teaches the mechanics of language to the student . [SEP]

[CLS] john a ##yt ##o wrote in the " dictionary of word origins " ( 1990 ) that study of the tri ##vi ##um ( grammar , logic , and rhetoric ) was re ##quisite preparation for study of the quad ##ri ##vi ##um ( arithmetic , geometry , music , and astronomy ) . [SEP]
[CLS] for the medieval student , the tri ##vi ##um was the cu ##rricular beginning of the acquisition of the seven liberal arts ; as such , it was the principal undergraduate course of study . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " trivial " arose from the contrast between the simpler tri ##vi ##um and the more difficult quad ##ri ##vi ##um . [SEP]
