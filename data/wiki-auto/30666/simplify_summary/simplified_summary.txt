the trivium is the part of the seven liberal arts .
the trivium is implicit in " de nuptiis philologiae et mercurii "lity " on the marriage of philology and mercury " litterigram " .
grammar , logic , and rhetoric were needed to be a classical education .
the three subjects were shown by the word " trivium " during the middle ages , but the tradition of first learning those subjects was established in ancient greece .
the subjects of the trivium are the foundation for the quadrivium , the upper division of the medieval education in the liberal arts .
grammar is the mechanics of the language .
the student " comes to terms , " defining the objects and information perceived by the five senses .
hence , the law of identity : " a tree is a tree , and not a cat " .
logicology also dialectichesis is the " mechanics " of thought and analysis , the process of identifying fallacious arguments and statements and so systematically removing contradictions , thereby producing factual knowledge that can be trusted .
for the medieval student , the trivium was the start of the purchase of the seven liberal arts ; as such , it was the principal undergraduate course of study .
the word " trivial " came from the contrast between the simpler trivium and the quadrivium .
