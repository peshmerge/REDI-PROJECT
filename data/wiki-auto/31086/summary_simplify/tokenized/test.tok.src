[CLS] mas ##ac ##cio ( , , ] ; december 21 , 140 ##1 – summer 142 ##8 ) , born tom ##mas ##o di ser giovanni di simone , was a fl ##ore ##ntine artist who is regarded as the first great italian painter of the qu ##att ##ro ##cent ##o period of the italian renaissance . [SEP]
[CLS] according to va ##sari , mas ##ac ##cio was the best painter of his generation because of his skill at im ##itating nature , rec ##rea ##ting life ##like figures and movements as well as a convincing sense of three - dimensional ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] the name may have been created to distinguish him from his principal collaborator , also called mas ##o , who came to be known as mas ##olin ##o ( " little / delicate tom " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] despite his brief career , he had a profound influence on other artists and is considered to have started the early italian renaissance in painting with his works in the mid - and late - 142 ##0s . [SEP]
[CLS] he was one of the first to use linear perspective in his painting , employing techniques such as vanishing point in art for the first time . [SEP]
[CLS] he moved away from the international gothic style and elaborate or ##name ##ntation of artists like gen ##tile da fa ##bria ##no to a more naturalist ##ic mode that employed perspective and chi ##aro ##scu ##ro for greater realism . [SEP]
[CLS] his father was a not ##ary and his mother the daughter of an inn ##keeper of barber ##ino di mug ##ello , a town a few miles north of florence . [SEP]
[CLS] his family name , cass ##ai , comes from the trade of his paternal grandfather simone and grand ##un ##cle lorenzo , who were carpenter ##s / cabinet makers ( " cass ##e " , hence " cass ##ai " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] he also was to become a painter , with the nickname of lo sc ##he ##gg ##ia meaning " the splinter . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 141 ##2 mon ##na ja ##co ##pa married an elderly ap ##oth ##eca ##ry , ted ##es ##co di maestro fe ##o , who already had several daughters , one of whom grew up to marry the only other documented painter from caste ##l san giovanni , mario ##tto di cr ##isto ##fan ##o ( 139 ##3 – 145 ##7 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no evidence for mas ##ac ##cio ' s artistic education , however renaissance painters traditionally began an apprenticeship with an established master around the age of 12 . [SEP]
[CLS] mas ##ac ##cio would likely have had to move to florence to receive his training , but he was not documented in the city until he joined the painters guild ( the arte de ' medici e sp ##ez ##ial ##i ) as an independent master on january 7 , 142 ##2 , signing as " mas ##us s . johann ##is simon ##is pic ##tor pop ##uli s . nic ##hol ##ae de fl ##ore ##nti ##a . " [SEP]
[CLS] the first works attributed to mas ##ac ##cio are the san gi ##oven ##ale trip ##ty ##ch ( 142 ##2 ) , now in the museum of cas ##cia di reg ##gel ##lo near florence , and the " virgin and child with saint anne " ( sant ' anna met ##ter ##za ) ( c . 142 ##4 ) at the u ##ffi ##zi . [SEP]
[CLS] the san gi ##oven ##ale altar ##piece was discovered in 1961 in the church of san gi ##oven ##ale at cas ##cia di reg ##gel ##lo , very close to mas ##ac ##cio ' s hometown . [SEP]
[CLS] the circumstances of the two artists ' collaboration are unclear ; since mas ##olin ##o was considerably older , it seems likely that he brought mas ##ac ##cio under his wing , but the division of hands in the " virgin and child with saint anne " is so marked that it is hard to see the older artist as the controlling figure in this commission . [SEP]
[CLS] mas ##olin ##o is believed to have painted the figure of st . anne and the angels that hold the cloth of honor behind her , while mas ##ac ##cio painted the more important virgin and child on their throne . [SEP]
[CLS] in florence , mas ##ac ##cio could study the works of gi ##otto and become friends with br ##une ##lles ##chi and donate ##llo . [SEP]
[CLS] according to va ##sari , at their prompting in 142 ##3 mas ##ac ##cio travelled to rome with mas ##olin ##o : from that point he was freed of all gothic and byzantine influence , as seen in his altar ##piece for the carmel ##ite church in pisa . [SEP]
[CLS] the traces of influences from ancient roman and greek art that are present in some of mas ##ac ##cio ' s works presumably originated from this trip : they should also have been present in a lost " sa ##gra " , ( today known through some drawings , including one by michelangelo ) , a fresco commissioned for the consecration ceremony of the church of santa maria del carmine in florence ( april 19 , 142 ##2 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the icon ##ography of the fresco decoration is somewhat unusual ; while the majority of the frescoes represent the life of st . peter , two scenes , on either side of the threshold of the chapel space , depict the temptation and expulsion of adam and eve . [SEP]
[CLS] " the expulsion from the garden of eden " , depicts a distressed adam and eve , chased from the garden by a threatening angel . [SEP]
[CLS] another major work is " the tribute money " in which jesus and the apostles are depicted as neo - classical arch ##ety ##pes . [SEP]
[CLS] scholars have often noted that the shadows of the figures all fall away from the chapel window , as if the figures are lit by it ; this is an added stroke of ve ##ris ##imi ##lit ##ude and further tribute to mas ##ac ##cio ' s innovative genius . [SEP]
[CLS] in the " resurrection of the son of theo ##phi ##lus " , he painted a pavement in perspective , framed by large buildings to obtain a three - dimensional space in which the figures are placed proportion ##ate to their surroundings . [SEP]
[CLS] on september 142 ##5 mas ##olin ##o left the work and went to hungary . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not known if this was because of money quarrel ##s with fe ##lice or an artistic diver ##gence with mas ##ac ##cio . [SEP]
[CLS] it has also been supposed that mas ##olin ##o planned this trip from the very beginning , and needed a close collaborator who could continue the work after his departure . [SEP]
[CLS] but mas ##ac ##cio left the frescoes unfinished in 142 ##6 in order to respond to other commissions , probably coming from the same patron . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it has also been suggested that the declining finances of fe ##lice bran ##ca ##cci were insufficient to pay for any further work , so the painter sought work elsewhere . [SEP]
[CLS] mas ##ac ##cio returned in 142 ##7 to work again in the carmine , beginning the " resurrection of the son of theo ##phi ##lus " , but apparently left it , too , unfinished , though it has also been suggested that the painting was severely damaged later in the century because it contained portraits of the bran ##ca ##cci family , at that time ex ##cor ##iated as enemies of the medici . [SEP]
[CLS] some of the scenes completed by mas ##ac ##cio and mas ##olin ##o were lost in a fire in 1771 ; we know about them only through va ##sari ' s biography . [SEP]
[CLS] in the twentieth century , the removal of marble slabs covering two areas of the paintings revealed the original appearance of the work . [SEP]
[CLS] the work was dismantled and dispersed in the 18th century , and only eleven of about twenty original panels have been rediscovered in various collections around the world . [SEP]
[CLS] although it is very damaged , the work features a sc ##ul ##pt ##ural and human madonna as well as a convincing per ##sp ##ect ##iva ##l depiction of her throne . [SEP]
[CLS] no contemporary documents record the patron of the fresco , but recently references to ownership of a tomb at the foot of the fresco have been found in the records of the bert ##i family of the santa maria novella quarter of florence ; this working - class family expressed a long - standing devotion to the trinity , and may well have commissioned mas ##ac ##cio ' s painting . [SEP]
[CLS] probably it is the male patron who is represented to the left of the virgin in the painting , while his wife is right of st . john the evangelist . [SEP]
[CLS] the fresco , considered by many to be mas ##ac ##cio ' s master ##work , is the earliest surviving painting to use systematic linear perspective , possibly devised by mas ##ac ##cio with the assistance of br ##une ##lles ##chi . [SEP]
[CLS] to ensure the precise transfer of the perspective lines from the sketch to the plaster , mas ##ac ##cio inserted a nail in at the vanishing point under the base of the cross and attached strings to it , which he pressed in ( or carved into ) the plaster . [SEP]
[CLS] the sacred figures and the donors are represented above an image of a skeleton lying on a sar ##co ##pha ##gus . [SEP]
[CLS] an inscription seemingly carved into the wall above the skeleton reads : " io fu ##i gia que ##l che vo ##i si ##ete e que ##l ch ' io son ##o vo ##i an ##co sar ##ete " ( i once was what now you are and what i am , you shall yet be ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this skeleton is at once a reference to adam , whose sin brought humans to death and a reminder to viewers that their time on earth is transit ##ory . [SEP]
[CLS] the combination of trinity , death and decay " can be interpreted as a trans ##position of the go ##l ##go ##tha chapel " in the church of the holy sep ##ul ##ch ##re in jerusalem . [SEP]
[CLS] mas ##ac ##cio produced two other works , a " nat ##ivity " and an " ann ##unciation " , now lost , before leaving for rome , where his companion mas ##olin ##o was fresco ##ing a chapel with scenes from the life of st . catherine in the basilica di san clement ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] it has never been confirmed that mas ##ac ##cio collaborated on that work , even though it is possible that he contributed to mas ##olin ##o ' s poly ##pt ##ych for the altar of santa maria mag ##gio ##re with his panel portraying " st . jerome and st . john the baptist " , now in the national gallery of london . [SEP]
[CLS] according to a legend , he was poisoned by a jealous rival painter . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , mas ##ac ##cio influenced a great many artists both while he was alive and posthumously . [SEP]
[CLS] his influence is particularly notable in the works of fl ##ore ##ntine minor masters , such as andrea di gi ##ust ##o , giovanni dal pont ##e , and others who attempted to replicate his glowing , life ##like forms . [SEP]
