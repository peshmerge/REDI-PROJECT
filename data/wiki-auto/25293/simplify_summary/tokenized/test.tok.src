[CLS] a quan ##go or quan ##go ( less often quan ##go or q ##ango ) is a quasi - autonomous non - governmental organisation . [SEP]
[CLS] it is typically an organisation to which a government has dev ##olved power , but which is still partly controlled and / or financed by government bodies . [SEP]
[CLS] as its name suggests , a quan ##go is a hybrid form of organization , with elements of both non - government organizations ( ngos ) and public sector bodies . [SEP]
[CLS] the concept is most often applied in the united kingdom and , to a lesser degree , australia , canada , ireland , new zealand , the united states , and other english - speaking countries . [SEP]
[CLS] in the uk , the term quan ##go covers different " arm ' s - length " government bodies , including " non - departmental public bodies " , non - ministerial government departments , and executive agencies . [SEP]
[CLS] one uk example is the forestry commission , which is a non - ministerial government department responsible for forestry in england . [SEP]
[CLS] the term has spawned the derivative quan ##go ##crat ; the taxpayers ' alliance fault ##ed a majority of them for not making declaration ##s of political activity . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " quasi - autonomous non - governmental organisation " was created in 1967 by alan pi ##fer of the us - based carnegie foundation , in an essay on the independence and accountability of public - funded bodies that are incorporated in the private sector . [SEP]
[CLS] pi ##fer ' s term was shortened to the acronym " " – later sp ##elt quan ##go – by anthony barker , a british participant during a follow - up conference on the subject . [SEP]
[CLS] it describes an ostensibly non - governmental organisation performing governmental functions , often in receipt of funding or other support from government , while mainstream ngos mostly get their donations or funds from the public and other organisations that support their cause . [SEP]
[CLS] numerous quan ##gos were created from the 1980s onwards . [SEP]
[CLS] examples in the united kingdom include those engaged in the regulation of various commercial and service sectors , such as the water services regulation authority . [SEP]
[CLS] an essential feature of a quan ##go in the original definition was that it should not be a formal part of the state structure . [SEP]
[CLS] the term was then extended to apply to a range of organisations , such as executive agencies providing ( from 1988 ) health , education and other services . [SEP]
[CLS] particularly in the uk , this occurred in a pole ##mic ##al atmosphere in which it was alleged that proliferation of such bodies was und ##es ##ira ##ble and should be reversed ( see below ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this spawned the related acronym " qu ##al ##go " , a ' quasi - autonomous " local " government organisation ' . [SEP]
[CLS] the less contentious term non - departmental public body ( ndp ##b ) is often employed to identify numerous organisations with dev ##olved governmental responsibilities . [SEP]
[CLS] " the times " has accused quan ##gos of bureau ##cratic waste and excess . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2005 , dan lewis , author of " the essential guide to quan ##gos " , claimed that the uk had 52 ##9 quan ##gos , many of which were useless and duplicate ##d the work of others . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2006 , there were 83 ##2 quan ##gos in ireland - 48 ##2 at national and 350 at local level - with a total of 5 , 78 ##4 individual appoint ##ees and a combined annual budget of € ##13 billion . [SEP]
[CLS] the cabinet office 2009 report on non - departmental public bodies found that there are 76 ##6 ndp ##bs sponsored by the uk government . [SEP]
[CLS] the number has been falling : there were 79 ##0 in 2008 and 82 ##7 in 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of ndp ##bs has fallen by over 10 % since 1997 . [SEP]
[CLS] staff ##ing and expenditure of ndp ##bs have increased . [SEP]
[CLS] they employed 111 , 000 people in 2009 and spent £ ##46 . 5 billion , of which £3 ##8 . 4 billion was directly funded by the government . [SEP]
[CLS] since the coalition government of conservatives and liberal democrats was formed in may 2010 , numerous ndp ##bs have been abolished under conservative plans to reduce the overall budget deficit by reducing the size of the public sector . [SEP]
[CLS] as of the end of july 2010 , the government had abolished at least 80 ndp ##bs and warned many others that they faced mergers or deep cuts . [SEP]
[CLS] in september 2010 , " the telegraph " published a leaked cabinet office list suggesting that a further 94 could be abolished , while four would be pri ##vati ##sed and 129 merged . [SEP]
[CLS] in august 2012 , cabinet office minister francis maud ##e said the government was on course to ab ##olis ##h 204 public bodies by 2015 , and said this would create a net saving of at least £2 . 6 billion . [SEP]
[CLS] use of the term quan ##go is less common and therefore more controversial in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] however , paul k ##rug ##man has stated that the us federal reserve is , effectively , " what the british call a quan ##go . . . its complex structure divides power between the federal government and the private banks that are its members , and in effect gives substantial autonomy to a governing board of long - term appoint ##ees . " [SEP]
[CLS] two other u . s . - based organizations that might be described as quan ##gos are the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers ( ic ##ann ) and the national center for missing and exploited children ( nc ##me ##c ) . [SEP]
