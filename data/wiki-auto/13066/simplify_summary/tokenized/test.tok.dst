[SEP]
[CLS] gershwin studied piano under charles ham ##bit ##zer and composition with rubin gold ##mark , henry cow ##ell , and joseph brody . [SEP]
[CLS] he began his career as a song plug ##ger but soon started composing broadway theater works with buddy des ##yl ##va and his brother ira gershwin . [SEP]
[CLS] he moved to paris intending to study with nadia bo ##ula ##nger , but she refused him ; he subsequently composed " an american in paris " . [SEP]
[CLS] he then returned to new york city and wrote " por ##gy and be ##ss " with ira and dub ##ose hey ##ward . [SEP]
[CLS] it was initially a commercial failure but came to be considered one of the most important american operas of the twentieth century and an american cultural classic . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin moved to hollywood and composed numerous film scores until his death in 1937 from a mali ##gnant brain tumor . [SEP]
[CLS] his compositions have been adapted for use in films and television , and several became jazz standards recorded and covered in many variations . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin was of ukrainian jewish and lithuanian jewish ancestry . [SEP]
[CLS] his grandfather , ja ##kov ge ##rs ##how ##itz , was born in odessa and had served for 25 years as a mechanic for the imperial russian army to earn the right of free travel and residence as a jew ; finally retiring near saint petersburg . [SEP]
[CLS] his teenage son , moi ##sh ##e ge ##rs ##how ##itz , worked as a leather cutter for women ' s shoes . [SEP]
[CLS] moi ##sh ##e ge ##rs ##how ##itz met and fell in love with ro ##za br ##us ##kin ##a , the teenage daughter of a fur ##rier in vilnius . [SEP]
[CLS] she and her family moved to new york due to increasing anti - jewish sentiment in russia , changing her first name to rose . [SEP]
[CLS] moi ##sh ##e , faced with compulsory military service if he remained in russia , moved to america as soon as he could afford to . [SEP]
[CLS] once in new york , he changed his first name to morris . [SEP]
[CLS] ge ##rs ##how ##itz lived with a maternal uncle in brooklyn , working as a foreman in a women ' s shoe factory . [SEP]
[CLS] he married rose on july 21 , 1895 , and ge ##rs ##how ##itz soon american ##ized his name to gershwin ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] their first child , ira gershwin , was born on december 6 , 1896 , after which the family moved into a second - floor apartment on brooklyn ' s s ##ned ##ike ##r avenue . [SEP]
[CLS] on september 26 , 1898 , george was born as second son to morris and rose br ##us ##kin gershwin ##e in their second - floor apartment at 242 s ##ned ##ike ##r avenue in brooklyn . [SEP]
[CLS] his birth certificate identifies him as jacob gershwin ##e , with the surname pronounced ' ge ##rs ##h - vin ' in the russian and yiddish immigrant community . [SEP]
[CLS] he had just one given name , contrary to the american practice of giving children both a first and middle name . [SEP]
[CLS] he was named after his grandfather , a one time russian army mechanic . [SEP]
[CLS] he soon became known as george , and changed the spelling of his surname to ' gershwin ' about the time he became a professional musician ; other family members followed suit . [SEP]
[CLS] after ira and george , another boy arthur gershwin ( 1900 – 1981 ) , and a girl frances gershwin ( 1906 – 1999 ) were born into the family . [SEP]
[CLS] the family lived in many different residences , as their father changed dwellings with each new enterprise in which he became involved . [SEP]
[CLS] mostly , they grew up around the yiddish theater district . [SEP]
[CLS] george and ira frequented the local yiddish theaters , with george occasionally appearing onstage as an extra . [SEP]
[CLS] george lived a usual childhood existence for children of new york ten ##ement ##s : running around with his boy ##hood friends , roller skating and mis ##be ##ha ##ving in the streets . [SEP]
[CLS] until 1908 , he cared nothing for music , when as a ten - year - old he was intrigued upon hearing his friend maxi ##e rosen ##z ##weig ' s violin recital . [SEP]
[CLS] the sound , and the way his friend played , captured him . [SEP]
[CLS] at around the same time , george ' s parents had bought a piano for lessons for his older brother ira , but to his parents ' surprise , and ira ' s relief , it was george who spent more time playing it . [SEP]
[CLS] although his younger sister frances was the first in the family to make a living through her musical talents , she married young and devoted herself to being a mother and house ##wife , thus surrender ##ing any serious time to musical endeavors . [SEP]
[CLS] having given up her performing career , she settled upon painting as a creative outlet , which had also been a hobby george briefly pursued . [SEP]
[CLS] arthur gershwin followed in the paths of george and ira , also becoming a composer of songs , musicals , and short piano works . [SEP]
[CLS] with a degree of frustration , george tried various piano teachers for some two years ( circa . [SEP]
[CLS] 1911 ) before finally being introduced to charles ham ##bit ##zer by jack miller ( circa . [SEP]
[CLS] 1913 ) , the pianist in the beethoven symphony orchestra . [SEP]
[CLS] until his death in 1918 , ham ##bit ##zer remained gershwin ' s musical mentor and taught him conventional piano technique , introduced him to music of the european classical tradition , and encouraged him to attend orchestral concerts . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1913 , gershwin left school at the age of 15 and found his first job as a " song plug ##ger " . [SEP]
[CLS] his employer was jerome h . re ##mic ##k and company , a detroit - based publishing firm with a branch office on new york city ' s tin pan alley , and he earned $ 15 a week . [SEP]
[CLS] his first published song was " when you want ' em , you can ' t get ' em , when you ' ve got ' em , you don ' t want ' em " in 1916 when gershwin was only 17 years old . [SEP]
[CLS] it earned him 50 cents . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1916 , gershwin started working for ae ##oli ##an company and standard music rolls in new york , recording and arranging . [SEP]
[CLS] he produced dozens , if not hundreds , of rolls under his own and assumed names ( pseudonym ##s attributed to gershwin include fred mu ##rth ##a and bert wynn ) . [SEP]
[CLS] he also recorded rolls of his own compositions for the duo - art and we ##lt ##e - mig ##non rep ##rod ##uc ##ing pianos . [SEP]
[CLS] as well as recording piano rolls , gershwin made a brief for ##ay into vaudeville , accompanying both nora bay ##es and louise dresser on the piano . [SEP]
[CLS] his 1917 novelty rag ##time , " ri ##al ##to ripple ##s " , was a commercial success . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1919 he scored his first big national hit with his song , " swan ##ee " , with words by irving caesar . [SEP]
[CLS] al jo ##lson , a famous broadway singer of the day , heard gershwin perform " swan ##ee " at a party and decided to sing it in one of his shows . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late 1910s , gershwin met songwriter and music director william daly . [SEP]
[CLS] the two collaborated on the broadway musicals " pic ##ca ##dilly to broadway " ( 1920 ) and " for goodness ' sake " ( 1922 ) , and jointly composed the score for " our nell " ( 1923 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this was the beginning of a long friendship . [SEP]
[CLS] daly was a frequent arranger , orchestra ##tor and conductor of gershwin ' s music , and gershwin periodically turned to him for musical advice . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1924 , gershwin composed his first major classical work , " rhapsody in blue " , for orchestra and piano . [SEP]
[CLS] it was orchestrated by fe ##rde gr ##of ##e and premiered by paul white ##man ' s concert band , in new york . [SEP]
[CLS] it subsequently went on to be his most popular work , and established gershwin ' s signature style and genius in blending vastly different musical styles in revolutionary ways . [SEP]
[CLS] since the early 1920s , gershwin frequently worked with the lyricist buddy des ##yl ##va . [SEP]
[CLS] together they created the experimental one - act jazz opera " blue monday , " set in harlem . [SEP]
[CLS] it is widely regarded as a forerunner to the groundbreaking " por ##gy and be ##ss " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1924 , george and ira gershwin collaborated on a stage musical comedy " lady be good " , which included such future standards as " fascinating rhythm " and " oh , lady be good ! " . [SEP]
[CLS] they followed this with " oh , kay ! " [SEP]
[CLS] ( 1926 ) , " funny face " ( 1927 ) and " strike up the band " ( 1927 and 1930 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin allowed the song , with a modified title , to ucla to be used as a football fight song , " strike up the band for ucla " . [SEP]
[CLS] in the mid - 1920s , gershwin stayed in paris for a short period of time , during which he applied to study composition with the noted nadia bo ##ula ##nger , who , along with several other prospective tutor ##s such as maurice rave ##l , rejected him . [SEP]
[CLS] they were afraid that rigorous classical study would ruin his jazz - influenced style . [SEP]
[CLS] maurice rave ##l ' s rejection letter to gershwin told him , " why become a second - rate rave ##l when you ' re already a first - rate gershwin ? " [SEP]
[CLS] while there , gershwin wrote " an american in paris " . [SEP]
[CLS] this work received mixed reviews upon its first performance at carnegie hall on december 13 , 1928 , but it quickly became part of the standard repertoire in europe and the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1929 , the gershwin brothers created " show girl " ; " girl crazy " performed 1930 , which introduced the standards " embrace ##able you " , debuted by ginger rogers , and " i got rhythm " ; and " of thee i sing " in 1931 , which was the first musical comedy to win the pulitzer prize for drama ; the winners were george s . kaufman , mor ##rie ry ##skin ##d , and ira gershwin . [SEP]
[CLS] his composition " por ##gy and be ##ss " was considered another american classic by the composer of ' rhapsody in blue ' — even if critics couldn ' t quite figure out how to evaluate it . [SEP]
[CLS] was it opera , or was it simply an ambitious broadway musical ? [SEP]
[CLS] ' it crossed the barriers , ' per theater historian robert kimball . [SEP]
[CLS] ' it wasn ' t a musical work per se , and it wasn ' t a drama per se – it eli ##cite ##d response from both music and drama critics . [SEP]
[CLS] but the work has sort of always been outside category . " [SEP]
[CLS] after the commercial failure of " por ##gy and be ##ss " , gershwin moved to hollywood , california . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1936 , he was commissioned by r ##ko pictures to write the music for the film " shall we dance " , starring fred as ##tai ##re and ginger rogers . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin ' s extended score , which would marry ballet with jazz in a new way , runs over an hour in length . [SEP]
[CLS] it took gershwin several months to compose and orchestra ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin had a ten - year affair with composer kay swift , whom he frequently consulted about his music . [SEP]
[CLS] the two never married , although she eventually divorced her husband james war ##burg in order to commit to the relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] swift ' s granddaughter , katharine weber , has suggested that the pair were not married because george ' s mother rose was " unhappy that kay swift wasn ' t jewish " . [SEP]
[CLS] " oh , kay " was named for her . [SEP]
[CLS] after gershwin ' s death , swift arranged some of his music , transcribed several of his recordings , and collaborated with his brother ira on several projects . [SEP]
[CLS] early in 1937 , gershwin began to complain of blinding headache ##s and a recurring impression that he smelled burning rubber . [SEP]
[CLS] on february 11 , 1937 , he performed his piano concerto in f in a special concert of his music with the san francisco symphony orchestra under the direction of french maestro pierre monte ##ux . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin , normally a superb pianist in his own compositions , suffered coordination problems and blackout ##s during the performance . [SEP]
[CLS] he was at the time working on other hollywood film projects while living with ira and his wife leon ##ore in their rented house in beverly hills . [SEP]
[CLS] leon ##ore gershwin began to be disturbed by george ' s mood swings and his seeming inability to eat without spilling food at the dinner table . [SEP]
[CLS] she suspected mental illness and insisted he be moved out of their house to lyricist yi ##p ha ##rb ##urg ' s empty quarters nearby , where he was placed in the care of his valet , paul mueller . [SEP]
[CLS] the headache ##s and ol ##factory hall ##uc ##inations continued . [SEP]
[CLS] on the night of july 9 , 1937 gershwin collapsed in ha ##rb ##urg ' s house , where he had been working on the score of " the gold ##wyn f ##oll ##ies " . [SEP]
[CLS] he was rushed back to cedar ##s of lebanon , and fell into a coma . [SEP]
[CLS] only then did his doctors come to believe that he was suffering from a brain tumor . [SEP]
[CLS] leon ##ore called george ' s close friend emil mo ##sb ##ache ##r and explained the dire need to find a ne ##uro ##sur ##ge ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##sb ##ache ##r immediately called pioneering ne ##uro ##sur ##ge ##on harvey cu ##shing in boston , who , retired for several years by then , recommended dr . walter dan ##dy , who was on a boat fishing in chesapeake bay with the governor of maryland . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##sb ##ache ##r then called the white house and had a coast guard cutter sent to find the governor ' s yacht and bring dan ##dy quickly to shore . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##sb ##ache ##r then chartered a plane and flew dan ##dy to newark airport , where he was to catch a plane to los angeles ; however , by that time , gershwin ' s condition was critical and the need for surgery was immediate . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early hours of july 11 , doctors at cedar ##s removed a large brain tumor , believed to have been a g ##lio ##bla ##sto ##ma , but gershwin died on the morning of sunday , july 11 , 1937 , at the age of 38 . [SEP]
[CLS] the fact that he had suddenly collapsed and become coma ##tose after he stood up on july 9 , has been interpreted as brain her ##nia ##tion with du ##ret ha ##em ##or ##rh ##ages . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin ' s friends and fans were shocked and devastated . [SEP]
[CLS] john o ' hara remarked : " george gershwin died on july 11 , 1937 , but i don ' t have to believe it if i don ' t want to . " [SEP]
[CLS] he was interred at westchester hills cemetery in hastings - on - hudson , new york . [SEP]
[CLS] a memorial concert was held at the hollywood bowl on september 8 , 1937 , at which otto k ##lem ##per ##er conducted his own orchestra ##tion of the second of gershwin ' s " three prelude ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin was influenced by french composers of the early twentieth century . [SEP]
[CLS] in turn maurice rave ##l was impressed with gershwin ' s abilities , commenting , " personally i find jazz most interesting : the rhythms , the way the melodies are handled , the melodies themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] i have heard of george gershwin ' s works and i find them intriguing . " [SEP]
[CLS] the orchestra ##tions in gershwin ' s symphonic works often seem similar to those of rave ##l ; likewise , rave ##l ' s two piano concerto ##s ev ##in ##ce an influence of gershwin . [SEP]
[CLS] george gershwin asked to study with rave ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] when rave ##l heard how much gershwin earned , rave ##l replied with words to the effect of , " you should give " me " lessons . " [SEP]
[CLS] ( some versions of this story feature igor st ##ra ##vinsky rather than rave ##l as the composer ; however st ##ra ##vinsky confirmed that he originally heard the story from rave ##l . ) [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin ' s own " concerto in f " was criticized for being related to the work of claude de ##bus ##sy , more so than to the expected jazz style . [SEP]
[CLS] the comparison did not deter him from continuing to explore french styles . [SEP]
[CLS] the title of " an american in paris " reflects the very journey that he had consciously taken as a composer : " the opening part will be developed in typical french style , in the manner of de ##bus ##sy and " les six " , though the tunes are original . " [SEP]
[CLS] aside from the french influence , gershwin was intrigued by the works of alba ##n berg , dmitri sho ##sta ##kovich , igor st ##ra ##vinsky , darius mil ##ha ##ud , and arnold sc ##hoe ##nberg . [SEP]
[CLS] he also asked sc ##hoe ##nberg for composition lessons . [SEP]
[CLS] sc ##hoe ##nberg refused , saying " i would only make you a bad sc ##hoe ##nberg , and you ' re such a good gershwin already . " [SEP]
[CLS] ( this quote is similar to one credited to maurice rave ##l during gershwin ' s 1928 visit to france – " why be a second - rate rave ##l , when you are a first - rate gershwin ? " ) [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin was particularly impressed by the music of berg , who gave him a score of the " lyric suite " . [SEP]
[CLS] he attended the american premiere of " wo ##zz ##eck " , conducted by leopold st ##oko ##wski in 1931 , and was " thrilled and deeply impressed " . [SEP]
[CLS] russian joseph sc ##hill ##inger ' s influence as gershwin ' s teacher of composition ( 1932 – 1936 ) was substantial in providing him with a method of composition . [SEP]
[CLS] there has been some disagreement about the nature of sc ##hill ##inger ' s influence on gershwin . [SEP]
[CLS] after the posthumous success of " por ##gy and be ##ss " , sc ##hill ##inger claimed he had a large and direct influence in overseeing the creation of the opera ; ira completely denied that his brother had any such assistance for this work . [SEP]
[CLS] a third account of gershwin ' s musical relationship with his teacher was written by gershwin ' s close friend vernon duke , also a sc ##hill ##inger student , in an article for " the musical quarterly " in 1947 . [SEP]
[CLS] what set gershwin apart was his ability to manipulate forms of music into his own unique voice . [SEP]
[CLS] he took the jazz he discovered on tin pan alley into the mainstream by sp ##lic ##ing its rhythms and ton ##ality with that of the popular songs of his era . [SEP]
[CLS] although george gershwin would seldom make grand statements about his music , he believed that " true music must reflect the thought and aspirations of the people and time . [SEP]
[CLS] my people are americans . [SEP]
[CLS] my time is today . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 2007 , the library of congress named their prize for popular song after george and ira gershwin . [SEP]
[CLS] recognizing the profound and positive effect of popular music on culture , the prize is given annually to a composer or performer whose lifetime contributions ex ##em ##plify the standard of excellence associated with the gershwin ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] on march 1 , 2007 , the first gershwin prize was awarded to paul simon . [SEP]
[CLS] early in his career , under both his own name and pseudonym ##s , gershwin recorded more than one hundred and forty player piano rolls which were a main source of his income . [SEP]
[CLS] the majority were popular music of the period and a smaller proportion were of his own works . [SEP]
[CLS] once his musical theatre - writing income became substantial , his regular roll - recording career became super ##fl ##uous . [SEP]
[CLS] he did record additional rolls throughout the 1920s of his main hits for the ae ##oli ##an company ' s rep ##rod ##uc ##ing piano , including a complete version of his " rhapsody in blue " . [SEP]
[CLS] compared to the piano rolls , there are few accessible audio recordings of gershwin ' s playing . [SEP]
[CLS] his first recording was his own " swan ##ee " with the fred van eps trio in 1919 . [SEP]
[CLS] the recorded balance highlights the banjo playing of van eps , and the piano is overshadowed . [SEP]
[CLS] the recording took place before " swan ##ee " became famous as an al jo ##lson specialty in early 1920 . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin recorded an ab ##ridge ##d version of " rhapsody in blue " with paul white ##man and his orchestra for the victor talking machine company in 1924 , soon after the world premiere . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin and the same orchestra made an electrical recording of the ab ##ridge ##d version for victor in 1927 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a dispute in the studio over interpretation angered white ##man and he left . [SEP]
[CLS] the conductor ' s baton was taken over by victor ' s staff conductor nathaniel shi ##lk ##ret . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin made a number of solo piano recordings of tunes from his musicals , some including the vocals of fred and adele as ##tai ##re , as well as his " three prelude ##s " for piano . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1929 , gershwin " supervised " the world premiere recording of " an american in paris " with nathaniel shi ##lk ##ret and the victor symphony orchestra . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin ' s role in the recording was rather limited , particularly because shi ##lk ##ret was conducting and had his own ideas about the music . [SEP]
[CLS] when it was realized that no one had been hired to play the brief celeste solo , gershwin was asked if he could and would play the instrument , and he agreed . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin can be heard , rather briefly , on the recording during the slow section . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin appeared on several radio programs , including rudy valle ##e ' s , and played some of his compositions . [SEP]
[CLS] this included the third movement of the " concerto in f " with valle ##e conducting the studio orchestra . [SEP]
[CLS] some of these performances were preserved on transcription discs and have been released on lp and cd . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1934 , in an effort to earn money to finance his planned folk opera , gershwin hosted his own radio program titled " music by gershwin " . [SEP]
[CLS] the show was broadcast on the nbc blue network from february to may and again in september through the final show on december 23 , 1934 . [SEP]
[CLS] he presented his own work as well as the work of other composers . [SEP]
[CLS] recordings from this and other radio broadcasts include his " variations on i got rhythm " , portions of the " concerto in f " , and numerous songs from his musical comedies . [SEP]
[CLS] he also recorded a run - through of his " second rhapsody " , conducting the orchestra and playing the piano solos . [SEP]
[CLS] gershwin recorded excerpts from " por ##gy and be ##ss " with members of the original cast , conducting the orchestra from the keyboard ; he even announced the selections and the names of the performers . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1935 rca victor asked him to supervise recordings of highlights from " por ##gy and be ##ss " ; these were his last recordings . [SEP]
[CLS] a 74 - second news ##ree ##l film clip of gershwin playing " i got rhythm " has survived , filmed at the opening of the manhattan theater ( now the ed sullivan theater ) in august 1931 . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also silent home movies of gershwin , some of them shot on ko ##da ##chrome color film stock , which have been featured in tribute ##s to the composer . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , there is news ##ree ##l footage of gershwin playing " made ##mo ##ise ##lle from new rochelle " and " strike up the band " on the piano during a broadway rehearsal of the 1930 production of " strike up the band " . [SEP]
[CLS] in the mid - 30 ##s , " strike up the band " was given to ucla to be used as a football fight song , " strike up the band for ucla " . [SEP]
[CLS] the comedy team of clark and mcc ##ull ##ough are seen con ##vers ##ing with gershwin , then singing as he plays . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1945 , the film biography " rhapsody in blue " was made , starring robert al ##da as george gershwin . [SEP]

[CLS] the estate continues to collect significant royalties from licensing the copyright ##s on his work . [SEP]
[CLS] the estate supported the sonny bono copyright term extension act because its 1923 cut ##off date was shortly before gershwin had begun to create his most popular works . [SEP]
