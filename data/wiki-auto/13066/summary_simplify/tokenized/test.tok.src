[CLS] the comparison did not deter him from continuing to explore french styles . [SEP]
[CLS] the title of " an american in paris " reflects the very journey that he had consciously taken as a composer : " the opening part will be developed in typical french style , in the manner of de ##bus ##sy and " les six " , though the tunes are original . " [SEP]
[CLS] aside from the french influence , gershwin was intrigued by the works of alba ##n berg , dmitri sho ##sta ##kovich , igor st ##ra ##vinsky , darius mil ##ha ##ud , and arnold sc ##hoe ##nberg . [SEP]
[CLS] sc ##hoe ##nberg refused , saying " i would only make you a bad sc ##hoe ##nberg , and you ' re such a good gershwin already . " [SEP]
