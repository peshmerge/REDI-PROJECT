[CLS] article five of the united states constitution describes the process whereby the constitution , the nation ' s frame of government , may be altered . [SEP]
[CLS] amendments may be proposed either by the congress with a two - thirds vote in both the house of representatives and the senate or by a convention of states called for by two - thirds of the state legislatures . [SEP]
[CLS] the vote of each state ( to either rat ##ify or reject a proposed amendment ) carries equal weight , regardless of a state ' s population or length of time in the union . [SEP]
[CLS] article v is silent regarding deadline ##s for the ratification of proposed amendments , but most amendments proposed since 1917 have included a deadline for ratification . [SEP]
[CLS] legal scholars generally agree that the amend ##ing process of article v can itself be amended by the procedures laid out in article v , but there is some disagreement over whether article v is the exclusive means of amend ##ing the constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to defining the procedures for altering the constitution , article v also shields three clauses in article i from ordinary amendment by attach ##ing st ##ip ##ulation ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] regarding two of the clauses — one concerning import ##ation of slaves and the other app ##ort ##ion ##ment of direct taxes — the prohibition on amendment was absolute but of limited duration , ex ##pi ##ring in 1808 ; the third was without an ex ##piration date but less absolute : " no state , without its consent , shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the senate . " [SEP]
[CLS] scholars disagree as to whether this shielded clause can itself be amended by the procedures laid out in article v . [SEP]
[CLS] thirty - three amendments to the united states constitution have been approved by the congress and sent to the states for ratification . [SEP]
[CLS] four of these amendments are still technically open and pending , one is closed and has failed by its own terms , and one is closed and has failed by the terms of the resolution proposing it . [SEP]
[CLS] the first method author ##izes congress , " whenever two - thirds of both houses shall dee ##m it necessary " ( a two - thirds of those members present — assuming that a quo ##rum exists at the time that the vote is cast — and not necessarily a two - thirds vote of the entire membership elected and serving in the two houses of congress ) , to propose constitutional amendments . [SEP]
[CLS] the second method requires congress , " on the application of the legislatures of two - thirds of the several states " ( presently 34 ) , to " call a convention for proposing amendments " . [SEP]
[CLS] this dual ##ity in article v is the result of compromise ##s made during the 1787 constitutional convention between two groups , one maintaining that the national legislature should have no role in the constitutional amendment process , and another contend ##ing that proposals to amend the constitution should originate in the national legislature and their ratification should be decided by state legislatures or state conventions . [SEP]
[CLS] each time the article v process has been initiated since 1789 , the first method for craft ##ing and proposing amendments has been used . [SEP]
[CLS] all 33 amendments submitted to the states for ratification originated in the congress . [SEP]
[CLS] 85 ) argued would enable state legislatures to " erect barriers against the en ##cr ##oa ##chment ##s of the national authority " , has yet to be invoked . [SEP]
[CLS] when the 1st congress considered a series of constitutional amendments , it was suggested that the two houses first adopt a resolution indicating that they deemed amendments necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] while article i section 7 provides that all federal legislation must , before becoming law , be presented to the president for his or her signature or veto , article v provides no such requirement for constitutional amendments approved by congress , or by a federal convention . [SEP]
[CLS] in " ho ##lling ##sworth v . virginia " ( 1798 ) , the supreme court affirmed that it is not necessary to place constitutional amendments before the president for approval or veto . [SEP]
[CLS] senators ; ( 2 ) permit the states to include factors other than equality of population in drawing state legislative district boundaries ; and ( 3 ) to propose an amendment requiring the u . s . budget to be balanced under most circumstances . [SEP]
[CLS] the campaign for a popularly elected senate is frequently credited with " pro ##dding " the senate to join the house of representatives in proposing what became the seventeenth amendment to the states in 1912 , while the latter two campaigns came very close to meeting the two - thirds threshold in the 1960s and 1980s , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] after being officially proposed , either by congress or a national convention of the states , a constitutional amendment must then be ratified by three - fourth ##s of the states . [SEP]
[CLS] congress is authorized to choose whether a proposed amendment is sent to the state legislatures or to state rat ##ifying conventions for ratification . [SEP]
[CLS] amendments ratified by the states under either procedure are ind ##ist ##ing ##uis ##hab ##le and have equal validity as part of the constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] the court had earlier , in " hawke v . smith " ( 1920 ) , upheld the ohio general assembly ' s ratification of the eighteenth amendment — which congress had sent to the state legislatures for ratification — after ohio voters successfully veto ##ed that approval through a popular referendum , ruling that a provision in the ohio constitution res ##erving to the state ' s voters the right to challenge and over ##turn its legislature ' s ratification of federal constitutional amendments was unconstitutional . [SEP]
[CLS] an amendment becomes an operative part of the constitution when it is ratified by the necessary number of states , rather than on the later date when its ratification is certified . [SEP]
[CLS] the arch ##ivist officially not ##ifies the states , by a registered letter to each state ' s governor , that an amendment has been proposed . [SEP]
[CLS] when a state rat ##ifies a proposed amendment , it sends the arch ##ivist an original or certified copy of the state ' s action . [SEP]
[CLS] the amendment and its certificate of ratification are then published in the " federal register " and " united states statutes at large " . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution is silent on the issue of whether or not congress may limit the length of time that the states have to rat ##ify constitutional amendments sent for their consideration . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also silent on the issue of whether or not congress , once it has sent an amendment that includes a ratification deadline to the states for their consideration , can extend that deadline . [SEP]
[CLS] granting that it found nothing express in article v relating to time constraints , the court yet allowed that it found intimate ##d in the amend ##ing process a " strongly suggest ##ive " argument that proposed amendments are not open to ratification for all time or by states acting at widely separate times . [SEP]
[CLS] in that case , related to the proposed child labor amendment , it held that the question of timeline ##ss of ratification is a political and non - just ##icia ##ble one , leaving the issue to congress ' s discretion . [SEP]
[CLS] based upon this precedent , the arch ##ivist of the united states proclaimed the twenty - seventh amendment as having been ratified when it surpassed the " three fourth ##s of the several states " plateau for becoming a part of the constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] whether once it has prescribed a ratification period congress may extend the period without nec ##ess ##itating action by already - ratified states em ##bro ##iled congress , the states , and the courts in argument with respect to the proposed equal rights amendment ( sent to the states on march 22 , 1972 with a seven - year ratification time limit attached ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the amendment ' s proponents argued that the fixing of a time limit and the extending of it were powers committed exclusively to congress under the political question doctrine and that in any event congress had power to extend . [SEP]
[CLS] it was argued that ina ##sm ##uch as the fixing of a reasonable time was within congress ' power and that congress could fix the time either in advance or at some later point , based upon its evaluation of the social and other bases of the nec ##ess ##ities of the amendment , congress did not do violence to the constitution when , once having fixed the time , it subsequently extended the time . [SEP]
[CLS] proponents recognized that if the time limit was fixed in the text of the amendment congress could not alter it because the time limit as well as the substantive provisions of the proposal had been subject to ratification by a number of states , making it una ##lter ##able by congress except through the amend ##ing process again . [SEP]
[CLS] opponents argued that congress , having by a two - thirds vote sent the amendment and its author ##izing resolution to the states , had put the matter beyond changing by passage of a simple resolution , that states had either acted upon the entire package or at least that they had or could have acted affirmative ##ly upon the promise of congress that if the amendment had not been ratified within the prescribed period it would ex ##pire and their assent would not be compelled for longer than they had intended . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1981 , the united states district court for the district of idaho , however , found that congress did not have the authority to extend the deadline , even when only contained within the proposing joint resolution ' s resolving clause . [SEP]
[CLS] article v also contains two statements that shield the subject matter of certain constitutional clauses from being amended . [SEP]
[CLS] it express ##ly provides that no amendment shall de ##pr ##ive a state of its equal suffrage ( representation ) in the senate , as described in , without such states ' consent . [SEP]
[CLS] law professor richard albert also holds that the equal suffrage provision could be amended through a " double amendment " process , contrasting the u . s . constitution with other constitution ##s that explicitly protect certain provisions from ever being amended and are themselves protected from being amended . [SEP]
[CLS] some other legal scholars , including thomas a . baker and douglas lin ##der , have rejected the notion that the equal suffrage provision could ever be amended without the consent of each state . [SEP]
[CLS] according to constitutional theorist and scholar lawrence g . sage ##r , some commentators have seriously questioned whether article v is the exclusive means of amend ##ing the constitution , or whether there are routes to amendment , including some routes in which the constitution could be unconscious ##ly or un ##wi ##tting ##ly amended in a period of sustained political activity on the part of a mobilized national constituency . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , ak ##hil amar rejects the notion that article v exclude ##s other modes of constitutional change , arguing instead that the procedure provided for in article v is simply the exclusive method the government may use to amend the constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] some argue that the constitution itself provides no mechanism for the american people to adopt constitutional amendments independently of article v . darren patrick guerra has argued that article v is a vital part of the american constitutional tradition and he defend ##s article v against modern critique ##s that article v is either too difficult , too und ##em ##oc ##ratic , or too formal . [SEP]
[CLS] instead he argues that article v provides a clear and stable way of amend ##ing the document that is explicit , authentic , and the exclusive means of amendment ; it promotes wisdom and justice through enhancing del ##ibe ##ration and pr ##udence ; and its process complement ##s federal ##ism and separation of powers that are key features of the constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] in the end , article v is an essential bu ##l ##wark to maintaining a written constitution that secure ##s the rights of the people against both elites and themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] in his farewell address , president george washington said : if in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong , let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution designate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] but let there be no change by us ##ur ##pati ##on ; for though this , in one instance , may be the instrument of good , it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed . [SEP]
[CLS] the precedent must always greatly over ##balance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield . [SEP]
[CLS] this statement by washington has become controversial , and scholars disagree about whether it still describes the proper constitutional order in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] scholars who dismiss washington ' s position often argue that the constitution itself was adopted without following the procedures in the articles of confederation , while constitutional attorney michael far ##ris disagree ##s , saying the convention was a product of the states ' residual power , and the amendment in adoption process was legal , having received the unanimous assent of the states ' legislatures . [SEP]
[CLS] according to law professor george made ##r , there have been numerous proposals to amend the constitution ' s amend ##ing procedures , and " it is generally accepted that constitutional amend ##ing provisions can be used to amend themselves . " [SEP]
