[CLS] tell ##uri ##um is a chemical element with the symbol te and atomic number 52 . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um is far more common in the universe as a whole than on earth . [SEP]
[CLS] its extreme ra ##rity in the earth ' s crust , comparable to that of platinum , is due partly its formation of a volatile h ##yd ##ride that caused tell ##uri ##um to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebula ##r formation of earth , and partly to tell ##uri ##um ’ s low affinity for oxygen that causes it to bind prefer ##ential ##ly to other cha ##lco ##phile ##s in dense minerals that sink into the core . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um - bearing compounds were first discovered in 1782 in a gold mine in klein ##sch ##lat ##ten , transylvania ( now z ##lat ##na , romania ) by austrian mineral ##ogist franz - joseph muller von reich ##enstein , although it was martin heinrich k ##la ##pro ##th who named the new element in 1798 after the latin word for " earth " , " tell ##us " . [SEP]
[CLS] gold tell ##uri ##de minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds . [SEP]
[CLS] however , they are not a commercially significant source of tell ##uri ##um itself , which is normally extracted as a by - product of copper and lead production . [SEP]
[CLS] in humans , tell ##uri ##um is partly meta ##bol ##ized into dime ##thy ##l tell ##uri ##de , ( ch ) te , a gas with a garlic - like odor exhaled in the breath of victims of tell ##uri ##um exposure or poisoning . [SEP]
[CLS] when molten , tell ##uri ##um is co ##rro ##sive to copper , iron , and stainless steel . [SEP]
[CLS] the other two , te and te , have been found to be slightly radioactive , with extremely long half - lives , including 2 . 2 × 10 years for te . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um ( te to te ) are among the light ##est elements known to undergo alpha decay . [SEP]
[CLS] with an abundance in the earth ' s crust comparable to that of platinum ( about 1 μ ##g / kg ) , tell ##uri ##um is one of the rare ##st stable solid elements . [SEP]
[CLS] in comparison , even the rare ##st of the stable lan ##than ##ides have crust ##al abundance ##s of 500 μ ##g / kg ( see abundance of the chemical elements ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this ra ##rity of tell ##uri ##um in the earth ' s crust is not a reflection of its cosmic abundance . [SEP]
[CLS] the ra ##rity of tell ##uri ##um on earth is thought to be caused by conditions during pre ##ac ##cre ##tion ##al sorting in the solar nebula , when the stable form of certain elements , in the absence of oxygen and water , was controlled by the red ##uc ##tive power of free hydrogen . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um is sometimes found in its native ( i . e . , elemental ) form , but is more often found as the tell ##uri ##des of gold such as cal ##aver ##ite and k ##ren ##ner ##ite ( two different poly ##mo ##rp ##hs of au ##te ) , pet ##zi ##te , ag ##au ##te , and sy ##lva ##ni ##te , ag ##au ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] the city of tell ##uri ##de , colorado , was named in hope of a strike of gold tell ##uri ##de ( which never materialized , though gold metal ore was found ) . [SEP]
[CLS] although tell ##uri ##um is found with gold more often than in un ##comb ##ined form , it is found even more often combined as tell ##uri ##des of more common metals ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] natural tell ##uri ##te and tell ##ura ##te minerals also occur , formed by oxidation of tell ##uri ##des near the earth ' s surface . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast to se ##len ##ium , tell ##uri ##um does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion ra ##di ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] in the gold rush of 1893 , miners in ka ##l ##go ##or ##lie discarded a p ##yr ##itic material as they searched for pure gold , and it was used to fill in pot ##holes and build sidewalks . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1896 , that tail ##ing was discovered to be cal ##aver ##ite , a tell ##uri ##de of gold , and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um ( latin " tell ##us " meaning " earth " ) was discovered in the 18th century in a gold ore from the mines in klein ##sch ##lat ##ten ( today z ##lat ##na ) , near today ' s city of alba i ##ulia , romania . [SEP]
[CLS] the following year , he reported that this was er ##rone ##ous and that the ore contained mostly gold and an unknown metal very similar to anti ##mony . [SEP]
[CLS] after a thorough investigation that lasted three years and included more than fifty tests , muller determined the specific gravity of the mineral and noted that when heated , the new metal gives off a white smoke with a ra ##dis ##h - like odor ; that it imp ##arts a red color to sulfur ##ic acid ; and that when this solution is dil ##uted with water , it has a black pre ##ci ##pit ##ate . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , he was not able to identify this metal and gave it the names " au ##rum paradox ##ium " ( paradox ##ical gold ) and " metal ##lum problematic ##um " ( problem metal ) , because it did not exhibit the properties predicted for anti ##mony . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1789 , a hungarian scientist , pal kit ##ai ##bel , discovered the element independently in an ore from de ##uts ##ch - pi ##ls ##en that had been regarded as argent ##iferous mo ##ly ##b ##den ##ite , but later he gave the credit to muller . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1960s brought an increase in the ##rm ##oe ##le ##ctric applications for tell ##uri ##um ( as bis ##mut ##h tell ##uri ##de ) , and in free - mach ##ining steel alloys , which became the dominant use . [SEP]
[CLS] the principal source of tell ##uri ##um is from an ##ode sl ##udge ##s from the electro ##ly ##tic refining of b ##list ##er copper . [SEP]
[CLS] the an ##ode sl ##udge ##s contain the se ##len ##ides and tell ##uri ##des of the noble metals in compounds with the formula ms ##e or mt ##e ( m = cu , ag , au ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the metal ions are reduced to the metals , while the tell ##uri ##de is converted to sodium tell ##uri ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##tes can be leach ##ed from the mixture with water and are normally present as hydro ##tell ##uri ##tes h ##te ##o in solution . [SEP]
[CLS] se ##len ##ites are also formed during this process , but they can be separated by adding sulfur ##ic acid . [SEP]
[CLS] the hydro ##tell ##uri ##tes are converted into the ins ##ol ##ub ##le tell ##uri ##um dioxide while the se ##len ##ites stay in solution . [SEP]
[CLS] the metal is produced from the oxide ( reduced ) either by electro ##lysis or by reacting the tell ##uri ##um dioxide with sulfur dioxide in sulfur ##ic acid . [SEP]
[CLS] in recent years , the tell ##uri ##um price was driven up by increased demand and limited supply , reaching as high as us $ 100 per pound in 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the expectation that improved production methods will double production , the united states department of energy ( doe ) anti ##ci ##pate ##s a supply short ##fall of tell ##uri ##um by 202 ##5 . [SEP]
[CLS] the british geological survey gives the following production numbers for 2009 : united states 50 t , peru 7 t , japan 40 t and canada 16 t . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um belongs to the cha ##lco ##gen ( group 16 ) family of elements on the periodic table , which also includes oxygen , sulfur , se ##len ##ium and polo ##nium : tell ##uri ##um and se ##len ##ium compounds are similar . [SEP]
[CLS] the − ##2 oxidation state is exhibited in binary compounds with many metals , such as zinc tell ##uri ##de , z ##nte , produced by heating tell ##uri ##um with zinc . [SEP]
[CLS] the other halo ##gens do not form hal ##ides with tell ##uri ##um in the + 6 oxidation state , but only te ##tra ##hal ##ides ( te ##cl ##4 , te ##br ##4 and te ##i ##4 ) in the + 4 state , and other lower hal ##ides ( te ##3 ##cl ##2 , te ##2 ##cl ##2 , te ##2 ##br ##2 , te ##2 ##i and two forms of te ##i ) . [SEP]
[CLS] halo ##tell ##uri ##um cat ##ions are also attested , including te ##i ##3 + , found in te ##i ##3 ##as ##f ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um mono ##xide was first reported in 1883 as a black amor ##ph ##ous solid formed by the heat decomposition of te ##so ##3 in vacuum , di ##sp ##rop ##ort ##ion ##ating into tell ##uri ##um dioxide , te ##o ##2 and elemental tell ##uri ##um upon heating . [SEP]
[CLS] since then , however , existence in the solid phase is doubted and in dispute , although it is known as a vapor fragment ; the black solid may be merely an e ##qui ##mo ##lar mixture of elemental tell ##uri ##um and tell ##uri ##um dioxide . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um dioxide is formed by heating tell ##uri ##um in air , where it burns with a blue flame . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um trio ##xide , β - te ##o ##3 , is obtained by thermal decomposition of te ( oh ) 6 . [SEP]
[CLS] the tell ##uri ##um oxide ##s and hydra ##ted oxide ##s form a series of acids , including tell ##uro ##us acid ( h ##2 ##te ##o ##3 ) , or ##th ##ote ##ll ##uri ##c acid ( te ( oh ) 6 ) and meta ##tell ##uri ##c acid ( ( h ##2 ##te ##o ##4 ) " n " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the two forms of tell ##uri ##c acid form " tell ##ura ##te " salts containing the te ##o and te ##o an ##ions , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uro ##us acid forms " tell ##uri ##te " salts containing the an ##ion te ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] other tell ##uri ##um cat ##ions include te ##f ##8 ##2 + , which consists of two fused tell ##uri ##um rings and the polymer ##ic te ##f ##7 ##2 + . [SEP]
[CLS] when tell ##uri ##um is treated with concentrated sulfur ##ic acid , the result is a red solution of the z ##int ##l ion , te ##42 + . [SEP]
[CLS] other tell ##uri ##um z ##int ##l cat ##ions include the polymer ##ic te ##7 ##2 + and the blue - black te ##8 ##2 + , consisting of two fused 5 - member ##ed tell ##uri ##um rings . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um does not readily form analogue ##s of alcohol ##s and th ##iol ##s , with the functional group – te ##h , that are called tell ##uro ##ls . [SEP]
[CLS] the – te ##h functional group is also attributed using the prefix " tell ##any ##l - " . [SEP]
[CLS] the largest consumer of tell ##uri ##um is metal ##lu ##rgy in iron , stainless steel , copper , and lead alloys . [SEP]
[CLS] the addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more mach ##ina ##ble than otherwise . [SEP]
[CLS] it is alloy ##ed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy , where the presence of electrically conduct ##ive free graph ##ite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results . [SEP]
[CLS] in lead , tell ##uri ##um improves strength and du ##ra ##bility , and decreases the co ##rro ##sive action of sulfur ##ic acid . [SEP]
[CLS] massive commercial production of cd ##te solar panels by first solar in recent years has significantly increased tell ##uri ##um demand . [SEP]
[CLS] replacing some of the cad ##mium in cd ##te by zinc , producing ( cd , z ##n ) te , produces a solid - state x - ray detector , providing an alternative to single - use film badges . [SEP]
[CLS] the greatest purity metal ##org ##ani ##cs of both se ##len ##ium and tell ##uri ##um are used in these processes . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um is used in the new phase change memory chips developed by intel . [SEP]
[CLS] organisms have shown a highly variable tolerance to tell ##uri ##um compounds . [SEP]
[CLS] many bacteria , such as " pseudo ##mona ##s ae ##rug ##ino ##sa " , take up tell ##uri ##te and reduce it to elemental tell ##uri ##um , which accumulate ##s and causes a characteristic and often dramatic darkening of cells . [SEP]
[CLS] in yeast , this reduction is mediated by the sulfate assimilation pathway . [SEP]
[CLS] dime ##thy ##l tell ##uri ##de has been observed in hot springs at very low concentrations . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um and tell ##uri ##um compounds are considered to be mildly toxic and need to be handled with care , although acute poisoning is rare . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um poisoning is particularly difficult to treat as many che ##lation agents used in the treatment of metal poisoning will increase the toxicity of tell ##uri ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] humans exposed to as little as 0 . 01 mg / m or less in air ex ##ude a foul garlic - like odor known as " tell ##uri ##um breath " . [SEP]
[CLS] this is caused by the body converting tell ##uri ##um from any oxidation state to dime ##thy ##l tell ##uri ##de , ( ch ) te . [SEP]
[CLS] even though the metabolic pathways of tell ##uri ##um are not known , it is generally assumed that they resemble those of the more extensively studied se ##len ##ium because the final methyl ##ated metabolic products of the two elements are similar . [SEP]
[CLS] the occupational safety and health administration ( os ##ha ) limits ( per ##missible exposure limit ) tell ##uri ##um exposure in the workplace to 0 . 1 mg / m over an eight - hour work ##day . [SEP]
[CLS] the national institute for occupational safety and health ( ni ##osh ) has set the recommended exposure limit ( re ##l ) at 0 . 1 mg / m over an eight - hour work ##day . [SEP]
