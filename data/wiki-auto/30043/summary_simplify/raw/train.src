Tellurium is a chemical element with the symbol Te and atomic number 52.
Tellurium is far more common in the Universe as a whole than on Earth.
Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is due partly its formation of a volatile hydride that caused tellurium to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of Earth, and partly to tellurium’s low affinity for oxygen that causes it to bind preferentially to other chalcophiles in dense minerals that sink into the core.
Tellurium-bearing compounds were first discovered in 1782 in a gold mine in Kleinschlatten, Transylvania (now Zlatna, Romania) by Austrian mineralogist Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein, although it was Martin Heinrich Klaproth who named the new element in 1798 after the Latin word for "earth", "tellus".
Gold telluride minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds.
However, they are not a commercially significant source of tellurium itself, which is normally extracted as a by-product of copper and lead production.
In humans, tellurium is partly metabolized into dimethyl telluride, (CH)Te, a gas with a garlic-like odor exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium exposure or poisoning.
When molten, tellurium is corrosive to copper, iron, and stainless steel.
The other two, Te and Te, have been found to be slightly radioactive, with extremely long half-lives, including 2.2 × 10 years for Te.
Tellurium (Te to Te ) are among the lightest elements known to undergo alpha decay.
With an abundance in the Earth's crust comparable to that of platinum (about 1 μg/kg), tellurium is one of the rarest stable solid elements.
In comparison, even the rarest of the stable lanthanides have crustal abundances of 500 μg/kg (see Abundance of the chemical elements).
This rarity of tellurium in the Earth's crust is not a reflection of its cosmic abundance.
The rarity of tellurium on Earth is thought to be caused by conditions during preaccretional sorting in the solar nebula, when the stable form of certain elements, in the absence of oxygen and water, was controlled by the reductive power of free hydrogen.
Tellurium is sometimes found in its native (i.e., elemental) form, but is more often found as the tellurides of gold such as calaverite and krennerite (two different polymorphs of AuTe), petzite, AgAuTe, and sylvanite, AgAuTe.
The city of Telluride, Colorado, was named in hope of a strike of gold telluride (which never materialized, though gold metal ore was found).
Although tellurium is found with gold more often than in uncombined form, it is found even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g.
Natural tellurite and tellurate minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface.
In contrast to selenium, tellurium does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii.
In the gold rush of 1893, miners in Kalgoorlie discarded a pyritic material as they searched for pure gold, and it was used to fill in potholes and build sidewalks.
In 1896, that tailing was discovered to be calaverite, a telluride of gold, and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets.
Tellurium (Latin "tellus" meaning "earth") was discovered in the 18th century in a gold ore from the mines in Kleinschlatten (today Zlatna), near today's city of Alba Iulia, Romania.
The following year, he reported that this was erroneous and that the ore contained mostly gold and an unknown metal very similar to antimony.
After a thorough investigation that lasted three years and included more than fifty tests, Müller determined the specific gravity of the mineral and noted that when heated, the new metal gives off a white smoke with a radish-like odor; that it imparts a red color to sulfuric acid; and that when this solution is diluted with water, it has a black precipitate.
Nevertheless, he was not able to identify this metal and gave it the names "aurum paradoxium" (paradoxical gold) and "metallum problematicum" (problem metal), because it did not exhibit the properties predicted for antimony.
In 1789, a Hungarian scientist, Pál Kitaibel, discovered the element independently in an ore from Deutsch-Pilsen that had been regarded as argentiferous molybdenite, but later he gave the credit to Müller.
The 1960s brought an increase in thermoelectric applications for tellurium (as bismuth telluride), and in free-machining steel alloys, which became the dominant use.
The principal source of tellurium is from anode sludges from the electrolytic refining of blister copper.
The anode sludges contain the selenides and tellurides of the noble metals in compounds with the formula MSe or MTe (M = Cu, Ag, Au).
The metal ions are reduced to the metals, while the telluride is converted to sodium tellurite.
Tellurites can be leached from the mixture with water and are normally present as hydrotellurites HTeO in solution.
Selenites are also formed during this process, but they can be separated by adding sulfuric acid.
The hydrotellurites are converted into the insoluble tellurium dioxide while the selenites stay in solution.
The metal is produced from the oxide (reduced) either by electrolysis or by reacting the tellurium dioxide with sulfur dioxide in sulfuric acid.
In recent years, the tellurium price was driven up by increased demand and limited supply, reaching as high as US$100 per pound in 2006.
Despite the expectation that improved production methods will double production, the United States Department of Energy (DoE) anticipates a supply shortfall of tellurium by 2025.
The British Geological Survey gives the following production numbers for 2009: United States 50 t, Peru 7 t, Japan 40 t and Canada 16 t.
Tellurium belongs to the chalcogen (group 16) family of elements on the periodic table, which also includes oxygen, sulfur, selenium and polonium: Tellurium and selenium compounds are similar.
The −2 oxidation state is exhibited in binary compounds with many metals, such as zinc telluride, ZnTe , produced by heating tellurium with zinc.
The other halogens do not form halides with tellurium in the +6 oxidation state, but only tetrahalides (TeCl4, TeBr4 and TeI4) in the +4 state, and other lower halides (Te3Cl2 , Te2Cl2 , Te2Br2 , Te2I and two forms of TeI ).
Halotellurium cations are also attested, including TeI3+ , found in TeI3AsF6 .
Tellurium monoxide was first reported in 1883 as a black amorphous solid formed by the heat decomposition of TeSO3 in vacuum, disproportionating into tellurium dioxide, TeO2 and elemental tellurium upon heating.
Since then, however, existence in the solid phase is doubted and in dispute, although it is known as a vapor fragment; the black solid may be merely an equimolar mixture of elemental tellurium and tellurium dioxide.
Tellurium dioxide is formed by heating tellurium in air, where it burns with a blue flame.
Tellurium trioxide, β-TeO3 , is obtained by thermal decomposition of Te(OH)6 .
The tellurium oxides and hydrated oxides form a series of acids, including tellurous acid (H2TeO3 ), orthotelluric acid (Te(OH)6 ) and metatelluric acid ((H2TeO4)"n" ).
The two forms of telluric acid form "tellurate" salts containing the TeO and TeO anions, respectively.
Tellurous acid forms "tellurite" salts containing the anion TeO .
Other tellurium cations include TeF82+ , which consists of two fused tellurium rings and the polymeric TeF72+ .
When tellurium is treated with concentrated sulfuric acid, the result is a red solution of the Zintl ion, Te42+ .
Other tellurium Zintl cations include the polymeric Te72+ and the blue-black Te82+ , consisting of two fused 5-membered tellurium rings.
Tellurium does not readily form analogues of alcohols and thiols, with the functional group –TeH, that are called tellurols.
The –TeH functional group is also attributed using the prefix "tellanyl-".
The largest consumer of tellurium is metallurgy in iron, stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys.
The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more machinable than otherwise.
It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where the presence of electrically conductive free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results.
In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.
Massive commercial production of CdTe solar panels by First Solar in recent years has significantly increased tellurium demand.
Replacing some of the cadmium in CdTe by zinc, producing (Cd,Zn)Te, produces a solid-state X-ray detector, providing an alternative to single-use film badges.
The greatest purity metalorganics of both selenium and tellurium are used in these processes.
Tellurium is used in the new phase change memory chips developed by Intel.
Organisms have shown a highly variable tolerance to tellurium compounds.
Many bacteria, such as "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", take up tellurite and reduce it to elemental tellurium, which accumulates and causes a characteristic and often dramatic darkening of cells.
In yeast, this reduction is mediated by the sulfate assimilation pathway.
Dimethyl telluride has been observed in hot springs at very low concentrations.
Tellurium and tellurium compounds are considered to be mildly toxic and need to be handled with care, although acute poisoning is rare.
Tellurium poisoning is particularly difficult to treat as many chelation agents used in the treatment of metal poisoning will increase the toxicity of tellurium.
Humans exposed to as little as 0.01 mg/m or less in air exude a foul garlic-like odor known as "tellurium breath".
This is caused by the body converting tellurium from any oxidation state to dimethyl telluride, (CH)Te.
Even though the metabolic pathways of tellurium are not known, it is generally assumed that they resemble those of the more extensively studied selenium because the final methylated metabolic products of the two elements are similar.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limits (permissible exposure limit) tellurium exposure in the workplace to 0.1 mg/m over an eight-hour workday.
The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the recommended exposure limit (REL) at 0.1 mg/m over an eight-hour workday.
In concentrations of 25 mg/m, tellurium is immediately dangerous to life and health.
