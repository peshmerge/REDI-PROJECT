[CLS] tell ##uri ##um is a chemical element with the symbol te and atomic number 52 . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a brittle , mildly toxic , rare , silver - white metal ##loid . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um is chemical ##ly related to se ##len ##ium and sulfur , all three of which are cha ##lco ##gens . [SEP]
[CLS] it is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um is far more common in the universe as a whole than on earth . [SEP]
[CLS] its extreme ra ##rity in the earth ' s crust , comparable to that of platinum , is due partly its formation of a volatile h ##yd ##ride that caused tell ##uri ##um to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebula ##r formation of earth , and partly to tell ##uri ##um ’ s low affinity for oxygen that causes it to bind prefer ##ential ##ly to other cha ##lco ##phile ##s in dense minerals that sink into the core . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um - bearing compounds were first discovered in 1782 in a gold mine in klein ##sch ##lat ##ten , transylvania ( now z ##lat ##na , romania ) by austrian mineral ##ogist franz - joseph muller von reich ##enstein , although it was martin heinrich k ##la ##pro ##th who named the new element in 1798 after the latin word for " earth " , " tell ##us " . [SEP]
[CLS] gold tell ##uri ##de minerals are the most notable natural gold compounds . [SEP]
[CLS] however , they are not a commercially significant source of tell ##uri ##um itself , which is normally extracted as a by - product of copper and lead production . [SEP]
[CLS] commercially , the primary use of tell ##uri ##um is copper ( tell ##uri ##um copper ) and steel alloys , where it improves mach ##ina ##bility . [SEP]
[CLS] applications in cd ##te solar panels and cad ##mium tell ##uri ##de semiconductor ##s also consume a considerable portion of tell ##uri ##um production . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um is considered a technology - critical element . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um has no biological function , although fungi can use it in place of sulfur and se ##len ##ium in amino acids such as tell ##uro ##cy ##stein ##e and tell ##uro ##met ##hi ##oni ##ne . [SEP]
[CLS] in humans , tell ##uri ##um is partly meta ##bol ##ized into dime ##thy ##l tell ##uri ##de , ( ch ) te , a gas with a garlic - like odor exhaled in the breath of victims of tell ##uri ##um exposure or poisoning . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um has two all ##ot ##rop ##es , crystalline and amor ##ph ##ous . [SEP]
[CLS] when crystalline , tell ##uri ##um is silvery - white with a metallic lust ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a brittle and easily pu ##lver ##ized metal ##loid . [SEP]
[CLS] amor ##ph ##ous tell ##uri ##um is a black - brown powder prepared by pre ##ci ##pit ##ating it from a solution of tell ##uro ##us acid or tell ##uri ##c acid ( te ( oh ) ) . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um is a semiconductor that shows a greater electrical conduct ##ivity in certain directions depending on atomic alignment ; the conduct ##ivity increases slightly when exposed to light ( photo ##con ##du ##ct ##ivity ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when molten , tell ##uri ##um is co ##rro ##sive to copper , iron , and stainless steel . [SEP]
[CLS] of the cha ##lco ##gens ( oxygen - family elements ) , tell ##uri ##um has the highest melting and boiling points , at 72 ##2 . 66 k and 126 ##1 k , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um adopt ##s a polymer ##ic structure consisting of z ##ig - za ##g chains of te atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] this gray material resist ##s oxidation by air and is not volatile . [SEP]
[CLS] naturally occurring tell ##uri ##um has eight isotope ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] six of those isotope ##s , te , te , te , te , te , and te , are stable . [SEP]
[CLS] the other two , te and te , have been found to be slightly radioactive , with extremely long half - lives , including 2 . 2 × 10 years for te . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the longest known half - life among all radio ##nu ##cl ##ides and is about 160 trillion ( 10 ) times the age of the known universe . [SEP]
[CLS] stable isotope ##s comprise only 33 . 2 % of naturally occurring tell ##uri ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] a further 30 artificial radio ##iso ##top ##es of tell ##uri ##um are known , with atomic masses ranging from 105 to 142 and with half - lives of 19 days or less . [SEP]
[CLS] also , 17 nuclear iso ##mers are known , with half - lives up to 154 days . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um ( te to te ) are among the light ##est elements known to undergo alpha decay . [SEP]
[CLS] the atomic mass of tell ##uri ##um ( 127 . 60 g · mo ##l ) exceeds that of io ##dine ( 126 . 90 g · mo ##l ) , the next element in the periodic table . [SEP]
[CLS] with an abundance in the earth ' s crust comparable to that of platinum ( about 1 μ ##g / kg ) , tell ##uri ##um is one of the rare ##st stable solid elements . [SEP]
[CLS] in comparison , even the rare ##st of the stable lan ##than ##ides have crust ##al abundance ##s of 500 μ ##g / kg ( see abundance of the chemical elements ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this ra ##rity of tell ##uri ##um in the earth ' s crust is not a reflection of its cosmic abundance . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um is more abundant than rub ##idium in the cosmos , though rub ##idium is 10 , 000 times more abundant in the earth ' s crust . [SEP]
[CLS] the ra ##rity of tell ##uri ##um on earth is thought to be caused by conditions during pre ##ac ##cre ##tion ##al sorting in the solar nebula , when the stable form of certain elements , in the absence of oxygen and water , was controlled by the red ##uc ##tive power of free hydrogen . [SEP]
[CLS] under this scenario , certain elements that form volatile h ##yd ##ride ##s , such as tell ##uri ##um , were severely depleted through eva ##por ##ation of these h ##yd ##ride ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um and se ##len ##ium are the heavy elements most depleted by this process . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um is sometimes found in its native ( i . e . , elemental ) form , but is more often found as the tell ##uri ##des of gold such as cal ##aver ##ite and k ##ren ##ner ##ite ( two different poly ##mo ##rp ##hs of au ##te ) , pet ##zi ##te , ag ##au ##te , and sy ##lva ##ni ##te , ag ##au ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] the city of tell ##uri ##de , colorado , was named in hope of a strike of gold tell ##uri ##de ( which never materialized , though gold metal ore was found ) . [SEP]
[CLS] gold itself is usually found un ##comb ##ined , but when found as a chemical compound , it is most often combined with tell ##uri ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] although tell ##uri ##um is found with gold more often than in un ##comb ##ined form , it is found even more often combined as tell ##uri ##des of more common metals ( e . g . mel ##oni ##te , ni ##te ) . [SEP]
[CLS] natural tell ##uri ##te and tell ##ura ##te minerals also occur , formed by oxidation of tell ##uri ##des near the earth ' s surface . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast to se ##len ##ium , tell ##uri ##um does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion ra ##di ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , many common sul ##fide minerals contain substantial quantities of se ##len ##ium and only traces of tell ##uri ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] in the gold rush of 1893 , miners in ka ##l ##go ##or ##lie discarded a p ##yr ##itic material as they searched for pure gold , and it was used to fill in pot ##holes and build sidewalks . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1896 , that tail ##ing was discovered to be cal ##aver ##ite , a tell ##uri ##de of gold , and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um ( latin " tell ##us " meaning " earth " ) was discovered in the 18th century in a gold ore from the mines in klein ##sch ##lat ##ten ( today z ##lat ##na ) , near today ' s city of alba i ##ulia , romania . [SEP]
[CLS] this ore was known as " fa ##cz ##eb ##aj ##er wei ##ße ##s b ##lat ##tri ##ges gold ##er ##z " ( white leaf ##y gold ore from fa ##cz ##eb ##aja , german name of face ##ban ##ya , now fat ##a bai ##i in alba county ) or " anti ##mona ##lis ##cher gold ##kie ##s " ( anti ##mon ##ic gold p ##yr ##ite ) , and according to anton von ru ##pp ##recht , was " sp ##ie ##ß ##gl ##ask ##oni ##g " ( " argent mo ##ly ##b ##di ##que " ) , containing native anti ##mony . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1782 franz - joseph muller von reich ##enstein , who was then serving as the austrian chief inspector of mines in transylvania , concluded that the ore did not contain anti ##mony but was bis ##mut ##h sul ##fide . [SEP]
[CLS] the following year , he reported that this was er ##rone ##ous and that the ore contained mostly gold and an unknown metal very similar to anti ##mony . [SEP]
[CLS] after a thorough investigation that lasted three years and included more than fifty tests , muller determined the specific gravity of the mineral and noted that when heated , the new metal gives off a white smoke with a ra ##dis ##h - like odor ; that it imp ##arts a red color to sulfur ##ic acid ; and that when this solution is dil ##uted with water , it has a black pre ##ci ##pit ##ate . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , he was not able to identify this metal and gave it the names " au ##rum paradox ##ium " ( paradox ##ical gold ) and " metal ##lum problematic ##um " ( problem metal ) , because it did not exhibit the properties predicted for anti ##mony . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1789 , a hungarian scientist , pal kit ##ai ##bel , discovered the element independently in an ore from de ##uts ##ch - pi ##ls ##en that had been regarded as argent ##iferous mo ##ly ##b ##den ##ite , but later he gave the credit to muller . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1798 , it was named by martin heinrich k ##la ##pro ##th , who had earlier isolated it from the mineral cal ##aver ##ite . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1960s brought an increase in the ##rm ##oe ##le ##ctric applications for tell ##uri ##um ( as bis ##mut ##h tell ##uri ##de ) , and in free - mach ##ining steel alloys , which became the dominant use . [SEP]
[CLS] the principal source of tell ##uri ##um is from an ##ode sl ##udge ##s from the electro ##ly ##tic refining of b ##list ##er copper . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a component of dust ##s from blast furnace refining of lead . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment of 1000 tons of copper ore typically yields one ki ##logram ( 2 . 2 pounds ) of tell ##uri ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] the an ##ode sl ##udge ##s contain the se ##len ##ides and tell ##uri ##des of the noble metals in compounds with the formula ms ##e or mt ##e ( m = cu , ag , au ) . [SEP]
[CLS] at temperatures of 500 °c the an ##ode sl ##udge ##s are roasted with sodium carbonate under air . [SEP]
[CLS] the metal ions are reduced to the metals , while the tell ##uri ##de is converted to sodium tell ##uri ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##tes can be leach ##ed from the mixture with water and are normally present as hydro ##tell ##uri ##tes h ##te ##o in solution . [SEP]
[CLS] se ##len ##ites are also formed during this process , but they can be separated by adding sulfur ##ic acid . [SEP]
[CLS] the hydro ##tell ##uri ##tes are converted into the ins ##ol ##ub ##le tell ##uri ##um dioxide while the se ##len ##ites stay in solution . [SEP]
[CLS] the metal is produced from the oxide ( reduced ) either by electro ##lysis or by reacting the tell ##uri ##um dioxide with sulfur dioxide in sulfur ##ic acid . [SEP]
[CLS] commercial - grade tell ##uri ##um is usually marketed as 200 - mesh powder but is also available as slabs , ing ##ots , sticks , or lump ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the year - end price for tell ##uri ##um in 2000 was us $ 14 per pound . [SEP]
[CLS] in recent years , the tell ##uri ##um price was driven up by increased demand and limited supply , reaching as high as us $ 100 per pound in 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the expectation that improved production methods will double production , the united states department of energy ( doe ) anti ##ci ##pate ##s a supply short ##fall of tell ##uri ##um by 202 ##5 . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um is produced mainly in the united states , peru , japan and canada . [SEP]

[CLS] tell ##uri ##um belongs to the cha ##lco ##gen ( group 16 ) family of elements on the periodic table , which also includes oxygen , sulfur , se ##len ##ium and polo ##nium : tell ##uri ##um and se ##len ##ium compounds are similar . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um exhibits the oxidation states − ##2 , + 2 , + 4 and + 6 , with + 4 being most common . [SEP]
[CLS] reduction of te metal produces the tell ##uri ##des and poly ##tell ##uri ##des , te . [SEP]
[CLS] the − ##2 oxidation state is exhibited in binary compounds with many metals , such as zinc tell ##uri ##de , z ##nte , produced by heating tell ##uri ##um with zinc . [SEP]

[CLS] the square anti ##pr ##ism ##atic an ##ion te ##f ##8 ##2 ##− is also attested . [SEP]
[CLS] the other halo ##gens do not form hal ##ides with tell ##uri ##um in the + 6 oxidation state , but only te ##tra ##hal ##ides ( te ##cl ##4 , te ##br ##4 and te ##i ##4 ) in the + 4 state , and other lower hal ##ides ( te ##3 ##cl ##2 , te ##2 ##cl ##2 , te ##2 ##br ##2 , te ##2 ##i and two forms of te ##i ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the + 4 oxidation state , halo ##tell ##ura ##te an ##ions are known , such as te ##cl ##6 ##2 ##− and te ##2 ##cl ##10 ##2 ##− . [SEP]
[CLS] halo ##tell ##uri ##um cat ##ions are also attested , including te ##i ##3 + , found in te ##i ##3 ##as ##f ##6 . [SEP]

[CLS] since then , however , existence in the solid phase is doubted and in dispute , although it is known as a vapor fragment ; the black solid may be merely an e ##qui ##mo ##lar mixture of elemental tell ##uri ##um and tell ##uri ##um dioxide . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um dioxide is formed by heating tell ##uri ##um in air , where it burns with a blue flame . [SEP]
[CLS] tell ##uri ##um trio ##xide , β - te ##o ##3 , is obtained by thermal decomposition of te ( oh ) 6 . [SEP]

[CLS] the tell ##uri ##um oxide ##s and hydra ##ted oxide ##s form a series of acids , including tell ##uro ##us acid ( h ##2 ##te ##o ##3 ) , or ##th ##ote ##ll ##uri ##c acid ( te ( oh ) 6 ) and meta ##tell ##uri ##c acid ( ( h ##2 ##te ##o ##4 ) " n " ) . [SEP]
