[CLS] in chemistry , a molecular orbital ( mo ) is a mathematical function describing the wave - like behavior of an electron in a molecule . [SEP]
[CLS] at an elementary level , it is used to describe the " region " of space in which the function has a significant amplitude . [SEP]
[CLS] a molecular orbital ( mo ) can be used to represent the regions in a molecule where an electron occupying that orbital is likely to be found . [SEP]
[CLS] molecular orbital ##s are obtained from the combination of atomic orbital ##s , which predict the location of an electron in an atom . [SEP]
[CLS] a molecular orbital can specify the electron configuration of a molecule : the spatial distribution and energy of one ( or one pair of ) electron ( s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] most commonly a mo is represented as a linear combination of atomic orbital ##s ( the lc ##ao - mo method ) , especially in qu ##ali ##tative or very approximate usage . [SEP]
[CLS] they are in ##val ##ua ##ble in providing a simple model of bonding in molecules , understood through molecular orbital theory . [SEP]
[CLS] most present - day methods in computational chemistry begin by calculating the mo ##s of the system . [SEP]
[CLS] a molecular orbital describes the behavior of one electron in the electric field generated by the nuclei and some average distribution of the other electrons . [SEP]
[CLS] necessarily this is an approximation , and highly accurate descriptions of the molecular electronic wave function do not have orbital ##s ( see configuration interaction ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , application of a symmetry operation s ( e . g . , a reflection , rotation , or inversion ) to molecular orbital ψ results in the molecular orbital being unchanged or rev ##ers ##ing its mathematical sign : s ##ψ = ± ##ψ . [SEP]
[CLS] the symmetry properties of molecular orbital ##s means that del ##oca ##lization is an inherent feature of molecular orbital theory and makes it fundamentally different from ( and complementary to ) vale ##nce bond theory , in which bonds are viewed as localized electron pairs , with allowance for resonance to account for del ##oca ##lization . [SEP]
[CLS] the advantage of this approach is that the orbital ##s will correspond more closely to the " bonds " of a molecule as depicted by a lewis structure . [SEP]
[CLS] molecular orbital ##s arise from allowed interactions between atomic orbital ##s , which are allowed if the sy ##mme ##tries ( determined from group theory ) of the atomic orbital ##s are compatible with each other . [SEP]
[CLS] efficiency of atomic orbital interactions is determined from the overlap ( a measure of how well two orbital ##s constructive ##ly interact with one another ) between two atomic orbital ##s , which is significant if the atomic orbital ##s are close in energy . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , the number of molecular orbital ##s formed must be equal to the number of atomic orbital ##s in the atoms being combined to form the molecule . [SEP]
[CLS] his ground - breaking paper showed how to derive the electronic structure of the flu ##orin ##e and oxygen molecules from quantum principles . [SEP]
[CLS] linear combinations of atomic orbital ##s ( lc ##ao ) can be used to estimate the molecular orbital ##s that are formed upon bonding between the molecule ' s constituent atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] similar to an atomic orbital , a sc ##hr ##od ##inger equation , which describes the behavior of an electron , can be constructed for a molecular orbital as well . [SEP]
[CLS] linear combinations of atomic orbital ##s , or the sums and differences of the atomic wave ##fu ##nction ##s , provide approximate solutions to the hart ##ree – f ##ock equations which correspond to the independent - particle approximation of the molecular sc ##hr ##od ##inger equation . [SEP]
[CLS] for simple dia ##tom ##ic molecules , the wave ##fu ##nction ##s obtained are represented mathematical ##ly by the equations [SEP]
[CLS] where formula _ 3 and formula _ 4 are the molecular wave ##fu ##nction ##s for the bonding and anti ##bon ##ding molecular orbital ##s , respectively , formula _ 5 and formula _ 6 are the atomic wave ##fu ##nction ##s from atoms a and b , respectively , and formula _ 7 and formula _ 8 are adjustable coefficients . [SEP]
[CLS] as the two atoms become closer together , their atomic orbital ##s overlap to produce areas of high electron density , and , as a consequence , molecular orbital ##s are formed between the two atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of nod ##al planes containing the intern ##uc ##lea ##r axis between the atoms concerned is zero for σ mo ##s , one for π , two for δ , three for φ and four for γ . [SEP]
[CLS] an mo will have σ - symmetry if the orbital is symmetric with respect to the axis joining the two nuclear centers , the intern ##uc ##lea ##r axis . [SEP]
[CLS] this means that rotation of the mo about the intern ##uc ##lea ##r axis does not result in a phase change . [SEP]
[CLS] a σ * orbital , sigma anti ##bon ##ding orbital , also maintains the same phase when rotated about the intern ##uc ##lea ##r axis . [SEP]
[CLS] the σ * orbital has a nod ##al plane that is between the nuclei and perpendicular to the intern ##uc ##lea ##r axis . [SEP]
[CLS] an mo will have π symmetry if the orbital is as ##ym ##metric with respect to rotation about the intern ##uc ##lea ##r axis . [SEP]
[CLS] this means that rotation of the mo about the intern ##uc ##lea ##r axis will result in a phase change . [SEP]
[CLS] there is one nod ##al plane containing the intern ##uc ##lea ##r axis , if real orbital ##s are considered . [SEP]
[CLS] a π * orbital , pi anti ##bon ##ding orbital , will also produce a phase change when rotated about the intern ##uc ##lea ##r axis . [SEP]
[CLS] theoretical chemist ##s have conjecture ##d that higher - order bonds , such as phi bonds corresponding to overlap of f atomic orbital ##s , are possible . [SEP]
[CLS] for molecules that possess a center of inversion ( centro ##sy ##mme ##tric molecules ) there are additional labels of symmetry that can be applied to molecular orbital ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] non - centro ##sy ##mme ##tric molecules include : if inversion through the center of symmetry in a molecule results in the same phases for the molecular orbital , then the mo is said to have ge ##rade ( g ) symmetry , from the german word for even . [SEP]
[CLS] if inversion through the center of symmetry in a molecule results in a phase change for the molecular orbital , then the mo is said to have un ##ger ##ade ( u ) symmetry , from the german word for odd . [SEP]
[CLS] for a bonding mo with π - symmetry the orbital is π because inversion through the center of symmetry for would produce a sign change ( the two p atomic orbital ##s are in phase with each other but the two lobes have opposite signs ) , while an anti ##bon ##ding mo with π - symmetry is π because inversion through the center of symmetry for would not produce a sign change ( the two p orbital ##s are anti ##sy ##mme ##tric by phase ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the qu ##ali ##tative approach of mo analysis uses a molecular orbital diagram to visual ##ize bonding interactions in a molecule . [SEP]
[CLS] in this type of diagram , the molecular orbital ##s are represented by horizontal lines ; the higher a line the higher the energy of the orbital , and de ##gen ##erate orbital ##s are placed on the same level with a space between them . [SEP]
[CLS] then , the electrons to be placed in the molecular orbital ##s are slot ##ted in one by one , keeping in mind the paul ##i exclusion principle and hu ##nd ' s rule of maximum multi ##plicity ( only 2 electrons , having opposite spins , per orbital ; place as many un ##pa ##ired electrons on one energy level as possible before starting to pair them ) . [SEP]
[CLS] for more complicated molecules , the wave mechanics approach loses utility in a qu ##ali ##tative understanding of bonding ( although is still necessary for a quantitative approach ) . [SEP]
[CLS] combine sal ##cs of the same symmetry type from the two fragments , and from n sal ##cs form n molecular orbital ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] estimate the relative energies of the molecular orbital ##s from considerations of overlap and relative energies of the parent orbital ##s , and draw the levels on a molecular orbital energy level diagram ( showing the origin of the orbital ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in the homo ##nu ##cle ##ar dia ##tom ##ic molecules of the first ten elements , the molecular orbital ##s derived from the p and the p atomic orbital ##s result in two de ##gen ##erate bonding orbital ##s ( of low energy ) and two de ##gen ##erate anti ##bon ##ding orbital ##s ( of high energy ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when the energy difference between the atomic orbital ##s of two atoms is quite large , one atom ' s orbital ##s contribute almost entirely to the bonding orbital ##s , and the other atom ' s orbital ##s contribute almost entirely to the anti ##bon ##ding orbital ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , n , with eight electrons in bonding orbital ##s and two electrons in anti ##bon ##ding orbital ##s , has a bond order of three , which constitutes a triple bond . [SEP]
[CLS] although be has a bond order of 0 according to mo analysis , there is experimental evidence of a highly unstable be molecule having a bond length of 245 pm and bond energy of 10 k ##j / mo ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest uno ##cc ##up ##ied molecular orbital are often referred to as the homo and lu ##mo , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] as a simple mo example , consider the electrons in a hydrogen molecule , h ( see molecular orbital diagram ) , with the two atoms labelled h ' and h " . [SEP]
[CLS] the lowest - energy atomic orbital ##s , 1 ##s ' and 1 ##s " , do not transform according to the sy ##mme ##tries of the molecule . [SEP]
[CLS] because the h molecule has two electrons , they can both go in the bonding orbital , making the system lower in energy ( hence more stable ) than two free hydrogen atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] as with h , the lowest energy atomic orbital ##s are the 1 ##s ' and 1 ##s " , and do not transform according to the sy ##mme ##tries of the molecule , while the symmetry adapted atomic orbital ##s do . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike h , with two vale ##nce electrons , he has four in its neutral ground state . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the resulting electron density around the molecule does not support the formation of a bond between the two atoms ; without a stable bond holding the atoms together , molecule would not be expected to exist . [SEP]
[CLS] another way of looking at it is that there are two bonding electrons and two anti ##bon ##ding electrons ; therefore , the bond order is 0 and no bond exists ( the molecule has one bound state supported by the van der wa ##als potential ) . [SEP]
[CLS] each li atom contributes three electrons for bonding interactions , and the six electrons fill the three mo ##s of lowest energy , σ ( 1 ##s ) , σ * ( 1 ##s ) , and σ ( 2 ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] considering a hypothetical molecule of he , since the basis set of atomic orbital ##s is the same as in the case of h , we find that both the bonding and anti ##bon ##ding orbital ##s are filled , so there is no energy advantage to the pair . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##h would have a slight energy advantage , but not as much as h + 2 he , so the molecule is very unstable and exists only briefly before deco ##mp ##osing into hydrogen and helium . [SEP]
[CLS] in general , we find that atoms such as he that have full energy shells rarely bond with other atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] orbital interactions to produce bonding or anti ##bon ##ding orbital ##s in het ##eron ##uc ##lea ##r dia ##tom ##ics occur if there is sufficient overlap between atomic orbital ##s as determined by their sy ##mme ##tries and similarity in orbital energies . [SEP]
[CLS] in hydrogen flu ##ori ##de h ##f overlap between the h 1 ##s and f 2 ##s orbital ##s is allowed by symmetry but the difference in energy between the two atomic orbital ##s prevents them from interacting to create a molecular orbital . [SEP]
[CLS] overlap between the h 1 ##s and f 2 ##p orbital ##s is also symmetry allowed , and these two atomic orbital ##s have a small energy separation . [SEP]
[CLS] since h ##f is a non - centro ##sy ##mme ##tric molecule , the symmetry labels g and u do not apply to its molecular orbital ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] to obtain quantitative values for the molecular energy levels , one needs to have molecular orbital ##s that are such that the configuration interaction ( ci ) expansion converge ##s fast towards the full ci limit . [SEP]
[CLS] one usually solve ##s this problem by expanding the molecular orbital ##s as linear combinations of ga ##uss ##ian functions centered on the atomic nuclei ( see linear combination of atomic orbital ##s and basis set ( chemistry ) ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there are a number of programs in which quantum chemical calculations of mo ##s can be performed , including spartan and hyper ##che ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] simple accounts often suggest that experimental molecular orbital energies can be obtained by the methods of ultra - violet photo ##ele ##ct ##ron spectroscopy for vale ##nce orbital ##s and x - ray photo ##ele ##ct ##ron spectroscopy for core orbital ##s . [SEP]
