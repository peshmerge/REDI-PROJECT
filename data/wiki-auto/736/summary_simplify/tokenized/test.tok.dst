[CLS] albert einstein ( ; ] ; 14 march 1879 – 18 april 1955 ) was a german - born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity , one of the two pillars of modern physics ( alongside quantum mechanics ) . [SEP]
[CLS] he is best known to the general public for his mass – energy equivalence formula formula _ 1 , which has been dubbed " the world ' s most famous equation " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields , and he published a paper on general relativity in 1916 with his theory of gr ##avi ##tation . [SEP]
[CLS] he continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory , which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules . [SEP]
[CLS] except for one year in prague , einstein lived in switzerland between 1895 and 1914 , during which time he reno ##unced his german citizenship in 1896 , then received his academic diploma from the swiss federal polytechnic school ( later the e ##idge ##nos ##sis ##che tech ##nis ##che hoc ##hs ##chule , et ##h ) in zurich in 1900 . [SEP]
[CLS] the same year , he published four groundbreaking papers during his renowned " ann ##us mira ##bilis " ( miracle year ) which brought him to the notice of the academic world at the age of 26 . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein taught theoretical physics at zurich between 1912 and 1914 , before he left for berlin , where he was elected to the prussian academy of sciences . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1933 , while einstein was visiting the united states , adolf hitler came to power . [SEP]
[CLS] on the eve of world war ii , he endorsed a letter to president franklin d . roosevelt alert ##ing him to the potential development of " extremely powerful bombs of a new type " and recommend ##ing that the us begin similar research . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein supported the allies , but he generally denounced the idea of using nuclear fission as a weapon . [SEP]
[CLS] he was affiliated with the institute for advanced study in princeton , new jersey , until his death in 1955 . [SEP]
[CLS] albert einstein was born in ul ##m , in the kingdom of wurttemberg in the german empire , on 14 march 1879 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1880 , the family moved to munich , where einstein ' s father and his uncle jakob founded " el ##ek ##tro ##tech ##nis ##che fa ##bri ##k j . einstein & ci ##e " , a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current . [SEP]
[CLS] the einstein ##s were non - ob ##ser ##vant ash ##ken ##azi jews , and albert attended a catholic elementary school in munich , from the age of 5 , for three years . [SEP]
[CLS] at the age of 8 , he was transferred to the lu ##it ##pol ##d gymnasium ( now known as the albert einstein gymnasium ) , where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the german empire seven years later . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1894 , hermann and jakob ' s company lost a bid to supply the city of munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current ( dc ) standard to the more efficient alternating current ( ac ) standard . [SEP]
[CLS] his father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering , but einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school ' s regime ##n and teaching method . [SEP]
[CLS] he later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rot ##e learning . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age , reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the p ##yt ##ha ##gor ##ean theorem at age 12 . [SEP]
[CLS] his passion for geometry and algebra led the twelve - year - old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a " mathematical structure " . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12 , and as a 14 - year - old he says he had " mastered integral and differential calculus " . [SEP]
[CLS] at age 13 , einstein was introduced to kant ' s " critique of pure reason " , and kant became his favorite philosopher , his tutor stating : " at the time he was still a child , only thirteen years old , yet kant ' s works , inc ##omp ##re ##hen ##sible to ordinary mortals , seemed to be clear to him . " [SEP]
[CLS] he failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination , but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics . [SEP]
[CLS] in january 1896 , with his father ' s approval , einstein reno ##unced his citizenship in the german kingdom of wurttemberg to avoid military service . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein ' s future wife , a 20 - year - old serbian woman mile ##va mari ##c , also enrolled at the polytechnic that year . [SEP]
[CLS] over the next few years , einstein ' s and mari ##c ' s friendship developed into romance , and they read books together on extra - cu ##rricular physics in which einstein was taking an increasing interest . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1900 , einstein passed the exams in math ##s and physics and was awarded the federal polytechnic teaching diploma . [SEP]
[CLS] there have been claims that mari ##c collaborated with einstein on his 1905 papers , known as the " ann ##us mira ##bilis " papers , but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions . [SEP]
[CLS] an early correspondence between einstein and mari ##c was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named " lies ##er ##l " , born in early 1902 in novi sad where mari ##c was staying with her parents . [SEP]
[CLS] mari ##c returned to switzerland without the child , whose real name and fate are unknown . [SEP]
[CLS] the contents of einstein ' s letter in september 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy . [SEP]
[CLS] the couple moved to berlin in april 1914 , but mari ##c returned to zurich with their sons after learning that einstein ' s chief romantic attraction was his first and second cousin elsa . [SEP]
[CLS] his mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylum ##s for several periods , finally being committed permanently after her death . [SEP]
[CLS] he wrote in 1910 , while his wife was pregnant with their second child : " i think of you in heart ##felt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be . " [SEP]
[CLS] with the help of marcel gross ##mann ' s father , he secured a job in bern at the federal office for intellectual property , the patent office , as an assistant examiner – level iii . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1903 , his position at the swiss patent office became permanent , although he was passed over for promotion until he " fully mastered machine technology " . [SEP]
[CLS] much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical – mechanical sync ##hr ##oni ##zation of time , two technical problems that show up conspicuous ##ly in the thought experiments that eventually led einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time . [SEP]
[CLS] with a few friends he had met in bern , einstein started a small discussion group in 1902 , self - mocking ##ly named " the olympia academy " , which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , einstein was awarded a phd by the university of zurich , with his dissertation " a new determination of molecular dimensions " . [SEP]
[CLS] in that same year , which has been called einstein ' s " ann ##us mira ##bilis " ( miracle year ) , he published four groundbreaking papers , on the photo ##ele ##ctric effect , brown ##ian motion , special relativity , and the equivalence of mass and energy , which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world , at the age of 26 . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1908 , he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the university of bern . [SEP]
[CLS] the following year , after giving a lecture on electro ##dy ##nami ##cs and the relativity principle at the university of zurich , alfred klein ##er recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein became a full professor at the german charles - ferdinand university in prague in april 1911 , accepting austrian citizenship in the austro - hungarian empire to do so . [SEP]
[CLS] he also studied continuum mechanics , the molecular theory of heat , and the problem of gr ##avi ##tation , on which he worked with mathematician and friend marcel gross ##mann . [SEP]
[CLS] on 3 july 1913 , he was voted for membership in the prussian academy of sciences in berlin . [SEP]
[CLS] max planck and walt ##her ne ##rn ##st visited him the next week in zurich to persuade him to join the academy , additionally offering him the post of director at the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics , which was soon to be established . [SEP]
[CLS] ( membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at the humboldt university of berlin . ) [SEP]
[CLS] his decision to move to berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin elsa , with whom he had developed a romantic affair . [SEP]
[CLS] based on calculations einstein made in 1911 , about his new theory of general relativity , light from another star should be bent by the sun ' s gravity . [SEP]
[CLS] on 7 november 1919 , the leading british newspaper " the times " printed a banner headline that read : " revolution in science – new theory of the universe – newton ##ian ideas overthrow ##n " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1920 , he became a foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences . [SEP]
[CLS] while the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial , the citation also does not treat even the cited photo ##ele ##ctric work as an " explanation " but merely as a " discovery of the law " , as the idea of photon ##s was considered out ##land ##ish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the planck spectrum by s . n . bose . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein visited new york city for the first time on 2 april 1921 , where he received an official welcome by mayor john francis h ##yla ##n , followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions . [SEP]
[CLS] he went on to deliver several lectures at columbia university and princeton university , and in washington he accompanied representatives of the national academy of science on a visit to the white house . [SEP]
[CLS] on his return to europe he was the guest of the british statesman and philosopher viscount hal ##dan ##e in london , where he met several renowned scientific , intellectual and political figures , and delivered a lecture at king ' s college london . [SEP]
[CLS] he also published an essay , " my first impression of the u . s . a . , " in july 1921 , in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of americans , much as had alexis de to ##c ##que ##ville , who published his own impressions in " democracy in america " ( 1835 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1922 , his travels took him to asia and later to palestine , as part of a six - month excursion and speaking tour , as he visited singapore , ceylon and japan , where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of japanese . [SEP]
[CLS] in a letter to his sons , he described his impression of the japanese as being modest , intelligent , consider ##ate , and having a true feel for art . [SEP]
[CLS] in his own travel diaries from his 1922 – 23 visit to asia , he expresses some views on the chinese , japanese and indian people , which have been described as x ##eno ##phobic and racist judgments when they were rediscovered in 2018 . [SEP]
[CLS] because of einstein ' s travels to the far east , he was unable to personally accept the nobel prize for physics at the stockholm award ceremony in december 1922 . [SEP]
[CLS] in his place , the banquet speech was held by a german diplomat , who praised einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peace ##maker and activist . [SEP]
[CLS] on his return voyage , he visited palestine for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region . [SEP]
[CLS] he was greeted as if he were a head of state , rather than a physicist , which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the british high commissioner , sir herbert samuel . [SEP]
[CLS] during one reception , the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him . [SEP]
[CLS] in einstein ' s talk to the audience , he expressed happiness that the jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein visited spain for two weeks in 1923 , where he briefly met santiago ramon y ca ##jal and also received a diploma from king alfonso xiii naming him a member of the spanish academy of sciences . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1922 to 1932 , einstein was a member of the international committee on intellectual cooperation of the league of nations in geneva ( with a few months of interruption in 1923 – 1924 ) , a body created to promote international exchange between scientists , researchers , teachers , artists and intellectuals . [SEP]
[CLS] originally slated to serve as the swiss delegate , secretary - general eric drummond was persuaded by catholic activists oskar hale ##cki and giuseppe mo ##tta to instead have him become the german delegate , thus allowing go ##nza ##gue de rey ##no ##ld to take the swiss spot , from which he promoted traditional ##ist catholic values . [SEP]
[CLS] in december 1930 , einstein visited america for the second time , originally intended as a two - month working visit as a research fellow at the california institute of technology . [SEP]
[CLS] after the national attention he received during his first trip to the us , he and his arranger ##s aimed to protect his privacy . [SEP]
[CLS] after arriving in new york city , einstein was taken to various places and events , including chinatown , a lunch with the editors of " the new york times " , and a performance of " carmen " at the metropolitan opera , where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival . [SEP]
[CLS] during the days following , he was given the keys to the city by mayor jimmy walker and met the president of columbia university , who described einstein as " the ruling monarch of the mind " . [SEP]
[CLS] harry emerson f ##os ##dick , pastor at new york ' s riverside church , gave einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full - size statue that the church made of einstein , standing at the entrance . [SEP]
[CLS] during an address to cal ##tech ' s students , einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good . [SEP]
[CLS] this ave ##rs ##ion to war also led einstein to be ##fr ##ien ##d author upton sinclair and film star charlie chaplin , both noted for their pac ##if ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] carl la ##em ##ml ##e , head of universal studios , gave einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to chaplin . [SEP]
[CLS] chaplin said einstein ' s outward persona , calm and gentle , seemed to conceal a " highly emotional temperament , " from which came his " extraordinary intellectual energy " . [SEP]
[CLS] walter isaac ##son , einstein ' s biographer , described this as " one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity " . [SEP]
[CLS] chaplin visited einstein at his home on a later trip to berlin , and recalled his " modest little flat " and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 1933 , while on a visit to the united states , einstein knew he could not return to germany with the rise to power of the nazis under germany ' s new chancellor , adolf hitler . [SEP]
[CLS] while at american universities in early 1933 , he undertook his third two - month visiting professorship at the california institute of technology in pasadena . [SEP]
[CLS] he and his wife elsa returned to europe by ship in march , and during the trip they learned that the german reich ##sta ##g passed the enabling act , which transformed hitler ' s government into a de facto legal dictatorship and that they would not be able to proceed to berlin . [SEP]
[CLS] later on they heard that their cottage was raided by the nazis and his personal sail ##boat confiscated . [SEP]
[CLS] upon landing in antwerp , belgium on 28 march , he immediately went to the german consulate and surrendered his passport , formally reno ##un ##cing his german citizenship . [SEP]
[CLS] after staying some days at castle can ##tec ##roy in mort ##sel , a villa was rented in de ha ##an on the belgian coast for half a year . [SEP]
[CLS] in april 1933 , einstein discovered that the new german government had passed laws barr ##ing jews from holding any official positions , including teaching at universities . [SEP]
[CLS] historian gerald holt ##on describes how , with " virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues , " thousands of jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed . [SEP]
[CLS] a month later , einstein ' s works were among those targeted by the german student union in the nazi book burning ##s , with nazi propaganda minister joseph go ##eb ##bel ##s pro ##claiming , " jewish intellectual ##ism is dead . " [SEP]
[CLS] one german magazine included him in a list of enemies of the german regime with the phrase , " not yet hanged " , offering a $ 5 , 000 bounty on his head . [SEP]
[CLS] in a subsequent letter to physicist and friend max born , who had already emigrated from germany to england , einstein wrote , " . . . [SEP]
[CLS] i must confess that the degree of their brutality and coward ##ice came as something of a surprise . " [SEP]
[CLS] after moving to the us , he described the book burning ##s as a " spontaneous emotional outburst " by those who " shu ##n popular enlightenment , " and " more than anything else in the world , fear the influence of men of intellectual independence . " [SEP]
[CLS] einstein was now without a permanent home , unsure where he would live and work , and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in germany . [SEP]
[CLS] in late july 1933 , he went to england for about six weeks at the personal invitation of british naval officer commander oliver locker - lamps ##on , who had become friends with einstein in the preceding years . [SEP]
[CLS] to protect einstein , locker - lamps ##on had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside london , with a photo of them carrying shotgun ##s and guarding einstein , published in the " daily herald " on 24 july 1933 . [SEP]
[CLS] locker - lamps ##on took einstein to meet winston churchill at his home , and later , austen chamberlain and former prime minister lloyd george . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein asked them to help bring jewish scientists out of germany . [SEP]
[CLS] british historian martin gilbert notes that churchill responded immediately , and sent his friend , physicist frederick lin ##de ##mann , to germany to seek out jewish scientists and place them in british universities . [SEP]
[CLS] churchill later observed that as a result of germany having driven the jews out , they had lowered their " technical standards " and put the allies ' technology ahead of theirs . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein later contacted leaders of other nations , including turkey ' s prime minister , is ##met in ##on ##u , to whom he wrote in september 1933 requesting placement of unemployed german - jewish scientists . [SEP]
[CLS] locker - lamps ##on also submitted a bill to parliament to extend british citizenship to einstein , during which period einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in europe . [SEP]
[CLS] in his speech he described einstein as a " citizen of the world " who should be offered a temporary shelter in the uk . [SEP]
[CLS] both bills failed , however , and einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the institute for advanced study , in princeton , new jersey , us , to become a resident scholar . [SEP]
[CLS] in october 1933 , einstein returned to the us and took up a position at the institute for advanced study , noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing nazi germany . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time , most american universities , including harvard , princeton and yale , had minimal or no jewish faculty or students , as a result of their jewish quota ##s , which lasted until the late 1940s . [SEP]
[CLS] he had offers from several european universities , including christ church , oxford where he stayed for three short periods between may 1931 and june 1933 and was offered a 5 - year students ##hip , but in 1935 , he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the united states and apply for citizenship . [SEP]
[CLS] he was one of the four first selected ( two of the others being john von neumann and kurt god ##el ) at the new institute , where he soon developed a close friendship with god ##el . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period , einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to ref ##ute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics , both unsuccessfully . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein and s ##zi ##lard , along with other refugees such as edward teller and eugene wig ##ner , " regarded it as their responsibility to alert americans to the possibility that german scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb , and to warn that hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon . " [SEP]
[CLS] to make certain the us was aware of the danger , in july 1939 , a few months before the beginning of world war ii in europe , s ##zi ##lard and wig ##ner visited einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs , which einstein , a pac ##if ##ist , said he had never considered . [SEP]
[CLS] he was asked to lend his support by writing a letter , with s ##zi ##lard , to president roosevelt , recommend ##ing the us pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research . [SEP]
[CLS] the letter is believed to be " arguably the key stimulus for the u . s . adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the u . s . entry into world war ii " . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to the letter , einstein used his connections with the belgian royal family and the belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the white house ' s oval office . [SEP]
[CLS] some say that as a result of einstein ' s letter and his meetings with roosevelt , the us entered the " race " to develop the bomb , drawing on its " immense material , financial , and scientific resources " to initiate the manhattan project . [SEP]
[CLS] by signing the letter to roosevelt , some argue he went against his pac ##if ##ist principles . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1954 , a year before his death , einstein said to his old friend , lin ##us paul ##ing , " i made one great mistake in my life — when i signed the letter to president roosevelt recommend ##ing that atom bombs be made ; but there was some justification — the danger that the germans would make them . . . " [SEP]
[CLS] einstein became an american citizen in 1940 . [SEP]
[CLS] not long after settling into his career at the institute for advanced study ( in princeton , new jersey ) , he expressed his appreciation of the merit ##oc ##rac ##y in american culture when compared to europe . [SEP]
[CLS] he recognized the " right of individuals to say and think what they pleased " , without social barriers , and as a result , individuals were encouraged , he said , to be more creative , a trait he valued from his own early education . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein joined the national association for the advancement of colored people ( naacp ) in princeton , where he campaigned for the civil rights of african americans . [SEP]
[CLS] a resident of princeton recalls that einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein was a figure ##head leader in helping establish the hebrew university of jerusalem , which opened in 1925 , and was among its first board of governors . [SEP]
[CLS] earlier , in 1921 , he was asked by the bio ##chemist and president of the world zionist organization , cha ##im wei ##zman ##n , to help raise funds for the planned university . [SEP]
[CLS] among those , he advised first creating an institute of agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land . [SEP]
[CLS] that should be followed , he suggested , by a chemical institute and an institute of micro ##biology , to fight the various ongoing epidemic ##s such as malaria , which he called an " evil " that was under ##mini ##ng a third of the country ' s development . [SEP]
[CLS] establishing an oriental studies institute , to include language courses given in both hebrew and arabic , for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments , was also important . [SEP]
[CLS] upon his death while in office in november 1952 and at the urging of e ##z ##rie ##l carl ##eb ##ach , prime minister david ben - gu ##rion offered einstein the position of president of israel , a mostly ceremonial post . [SEP]
[CLS] when he turned 13 , he discovered the violin sonata ##s of mozart , whereupon he became en ##amo ##red of mozart ' s compositions and studied music more willingly . [SEP]
[CLS] at age 17 , he was heard by a school examiner in aa ##ra ##u while playing beethoven ' s violin sonata ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] what struck the examiner , writes bot ##stein , was that einstein " displayed a deep love of the music , a quality that was and remains in short supply . [SEP]
[CLS] although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time , among those with whom einstein played chamber music were a few professionals , and he performed for private audiences and friends . [SEP]
[CLS] chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in bern , zurich , and berlin , where he played with max planck and his son , among others . [SEP]
[CLS] he is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the koch ##el catalogue of mozart ' s work ; that edition was prepared by alfred einstein , who may have been a distant relation . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1931 , while engaged in research at the california institute of technology , he visited the zoe ##ll ##ner family conservatory in los angeles , where he played some of beethoven and mozart ' s works with members of the zoe ##ll ##ner quartet . [SEP]
[CLS] near the end of his life , when the young ju ##ill ##iard quartet visited him in princeton , he played his violin with them , and the quartet was " impressed by einstein ' s level of coordination and into ##nation " . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics . [SEP]
[CLS] he strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation - states in the framework of a world federation . [SEP]
[CLS] he exchanged written letters with gandhi , and called him " a role model for the generations to come " in a letter writing about him . [SEP]
[CLS] he did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings , a view which he described as naive . [SEP]
[CLS] he clarified , however , that " i am not an atheist " , preferring to call himself an ag ##nostic , or a " deeply religious non ##bel ##ie ##ver . " [SEP]
[CLS] for the seventy - fifth anniversary of the new york society for ethical culture , he stated that the idea of ethical culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious ideal ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] in a one - and - a - half - page hand - written german - language letter to philosopher eric gut ##kind , dated princeton , 3 january 1954 , fifteen months before his death , einstein wrote : " the word god is for me nothing but the expression and product of human weaknesses , the bible a collection of venerable but still rather primitive legends . [SEP]
[CLS] . . . for me the jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish super ##sti ##tion . [SEP]
[CLS] on 17 april 1955 , einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the ru ##pt ##ure of an abdominal ao ##rti ##c an ##eur ##ys ##m , which had previously been reinforced surgical ##ly by rudolph ni ##ssen in 1948 . [SEP]
[CLS] he took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of israel ' s seventh anniversary with him to the hospital , but he did not live long enough to complete it . [SEP]
[CLS] he died in princeton hospital early the next morning at the age of 76 , having continued to work until near the end . [SEP]
[CLS] during the autopsy , the path ##ologist of princeton hospital , thomas st ##olt ##z harvey , removed einstein ' s brain for preservation without the permission of his family , in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made einstein so intelligent . [SEP]
[CLS] in a memorial lecture delivered on 13 december 1965 , at unesco headquarters , nuclear physicist j . robert op ##pen ##heimer summarized his impression of einstein as a person : " he was almost wholly without so ##phi ##stic ##ation and wholly without world ##liness . . . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the bose – einstein statistics , the einstein refrigerator and others . [SEP]
[CLS] the " ann ##us mira ##bilis " papers are four articles pertaining to the photo ##ele ##ctric effect ( which gave rise to quantum theory ) , brown ##ian motion , the special theory of relativity , and e = mc that einstein published in the " anna ##len der ph ##ys ##ik " scientific journal in 1905 . [SEP]
[CLS] these four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space , time , and matter . [SEP]
[CLS] these papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on brown ##ian motion , which showed that brown ##ian movement can be con ##st ##rued as firm evidence that molecules exist . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein returned to the problem of the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mic fluctuations , giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##dina ##rily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein quantitative ##ly derived critical op ##ales ##cence from a treatment of density fluctuations , and demonstrated how both the effect and ray ##leigh scattering originate from the atom ##istic constitution of matter . [SEP]
[CLS] this paper predicted that , when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer , a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down , and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein ' s 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years , but was accepted by leading physicist ##s , starting with max planck . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kin ##ema ##tics ( the study of moving bodies ) . [SEP]
[CLS] according to general relativity , the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warp ##ing of space and time by those masses . [SEP]
[CLS] it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes , regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape . [SEP]
[CLS] as einstein later said , the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of in ##ert ##ial motions within special relativity was un ##sat ##is ##factory , while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion ( even accelerated ones ) should appear more satisfactory . [SEP]
[CLS] in the same article , einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dil ##ation , gravitational reds ##hi ##ft and def ##le ##ction of light . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1911 , einstein published another article " on the influence of gr ##avi ##tation on the propagation of light " expanding on the 1907 article , in which he estimated the amount of def ##le ##ction of light by massive bodies . [SEP]
[CLS] the existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its loren ##tz in ##var ##iance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it . [SEP]
[CLS] by contrast , gravitational waves cannot exist in the newton ##ian theory of gr ##avi ##tation , which post ##ulates that the physical interactions of gravity prop ##aga ##te at infinite speed . [SEP]
[CLS] the explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emi ##tting gravitational waves . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein ' s prediction was confirmed on 11 february 2016 , when researchers at li ##go published the first observation of gravitational waves , detected on earth on 14 september 2015 , exactly one hundred years after the prediction . [SEP]
[CLS] he formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general re ##lat ##ivist ##ic field theory is impossible . [SEP]
[CLS] as its name suggests , it was a sketch of a theory , less elegant and more difficult than general relativity , with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] after more than two years of intensive work , einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in november 1915 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1917 , einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole . [SEP]
[CLS] he discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic , either contracting or expanding . [SEP]
[CLS] as observation ##al evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time , einstein introduced a new term , the co ##smo ##logical constant , to the field equations , in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe . [SEP]
[CLS] the modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature , in accordance with einstein ' s understanding of mach ' s principle in these years . [SEP]
[CLS] following the discovery of the recession of the nebula ##e by edwin hub ##ble in 1929 , einstein abandoned his static model of the universe , and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos , the friedman ##n - einstein universe of 1931 and the einstein – de sit ##ter universe of 1932 . [SEP]
[CLS] in many einstein biographies , it is claimed that einstein referred to the co ##smo ##logical constant in later years as his " biggest blu ##nder " . [SEP]
[CLS] in late 2013 , a team led by the irish physicist co ##rma ##c o ' rai ##fe ##art ##ai ##gh discovered evidence that , shortly after learning of hub ##ble ' s observations of the recession of the nebula ##e , einstein considered a steady - state model of the universe . [SEP]
[CLS] in a hit ##her ##to overlooked manuscript , apparently written in early 1931 , einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter , a process he associated with the co ##smo ##logical constant . [SEP]
[CLS] for the density to remain constant , new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space . " [SEP]
[CLS] it thus appears that einstein considered a steady - state model of the expanding universe many years before ho ##yle , bond ##i and gold . [SEP]
[CLS] general relativity includes a dynamic ##al space ##time , so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum . [SEP]
[CLS] no ##eth ##er ' s theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a la ##gra ##ng ##ian with translation in ##var ##iance , but general co ##var ##iance makes translation in ##var ##iance into something of a gauge symmetry . [SEP]
[CLS] the energy and momentum derived within general relativity by no ##eth ##er ' s prescription ##s do not make a real tensor for this reason . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason : the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates . [SEP]
[CLS] he maintained that the non - co ##var ##ian ##t energy momentum pseudo ##tens ##or was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field . [SEP]
[CLS] this approach has been echoed by lev landau and ev ##geny li ##fs ##hit ##z , and others , and has become standard . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of non - co ##var ##ian ##t objects like pseudo ##tens ##ors was heavily criticized in 1917 by erwin sc ##hr ##od ##inger and others . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1935 , einstein collaborated with nathan rosen to produce a model of a worm ##hole , often called einstein – rosen bridges . [SEP]
[CLS] his motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations , in line with the program outlined in the paper " do gravitational fields play an important role in the constitution of the elementary particles ? " . [SEP]
[CLS] if one end of a worm ##hole was positively charged , the other end would be negatively charged . [SEP]
[CLS] the theory of general relativity has a fundamental law ##the einstein field equations , which describe how space curves . [SEP]
[CLS] since the equations of general relativity are non - linear , a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields , like a black hole , would move on a trajectory which is determined by the einstein field equations themselves , not by a new law . [SEP]
[CLS] so einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution , like a black hole , would be determined to be a geo ##des ##ic from general relativity itself . [SEP]
[CLS] this idea only became universally accepted in 1919 , with robert mill ##ika ##n ' s detailed experiments on the photo ##ele ##ctric effect , and with the measurement of compton scattering . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1907 , einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic os ##ci ##lla ##tor . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual os ##ci ##llation ##s would be difficult , but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] after ernest rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets , ni ##els bo ##hr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical post ##ulates introduced by planck and developed by einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms , and the periodic table of the elements . [SEP]
[CLS] wien had shown that the hypothesis of adi ##aba ##tic in ##var ##iance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the black ##body curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1924 , einstein received a description of a statistical model from indian physicist sat ##yen ##dra nat ##h bose , based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of ind ##ist ##ing ##uis ##hab ##le particles . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications , among them the bose – einstein conde ##ns ##ate phenomenon that some part ##iculate ##s should appear at very low temperatures . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein ' s sketches for this project may be seen in the einstein archive in the library of the leiden university . [SEP]
[CLS] although the patent office promoted einstein to technical examiner second class in 1906 , he had not given up on academia . [SEP]
[CLS] in " " uber die en ##t ##wick ##lun ##g un ##ser ##er an ##sch ##au ##ungen uber das wes ##en und die ko ##nst ##it ##ution der st ##rah ##lun ##g " " ( " " ) , on the quan ##ti ##zation of light , and in an earlier 1909 paper , einstein showed that max planck ' s energy quan ##ta must have well - defined moment ##a and act in some respects as independent , point - like particles . [SEP]
[CLS] this paper introduced the " photon " concept ( although the name " photon " was introduced later by gilbert n . lewis in 1926 ) and inspired the notion of wave – particle dual ##ity in quantum mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] assuming the energy of rotating dia ##tom ##ic molecules contains zero - point energy , they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data . [SEP]
[CLS] however , after publishing the findings , they promptly withdrew their support , because they no longer had confidence in the correct ##ness of the idea of zero - point energy . [SEP]
[CLS] this paper was enormous ##ly influential in the later development of quantum mechanics , because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws . [SEP]
[CLS] in another major paper from this era , einstein gave a wave equation for de bro ##gli ##e waves , which einstein suggested was the hamilton – jacob ##i equation of mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein was di ##sp ##lea ##sed with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925 . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , it was einstein himself , in his 1917 paper that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission , who first proposed the fundamental role of chance in explaining quantum processes . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , bo ##hr and his followers maintained that all we can know are the results of measurements and observations , and that it makes no sense to spec ##ulate about an ultimate reality that exists beyond our perceptions . [SEP]
[CLS] no matter how far the two particles were separated , a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle ; likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle , without needing to disturb the other particle in any way . [SEP]
[CLS] given einstein ' s concept of local realism , there were two possibilities : ( 1 ) either the other particle had these properties already determined , or ( 2 ) the process of measuring the first particle instant ##aneous ##ly affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein ' s belief in local realism led him to assert that , while the correct ##ness of quantum mechanics was not in question , it must be incomplete . [SEP]
[CLS] but as a physical principle , local realism was shown to be incorrect when the aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed bell ' s theorem , which j . s . bell had del ##ine ##ated in 1964 . [SEP]
[CLS] the results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which " particles are regarded as un ##connected independent classical - like entities , each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated . " [SEP]
[CLS] although einstein was wrong about local realism , his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite , " en ##tangled quantum states " , has resulted in the ep ##r paper becoming among the top ten papers published in physical review . [SEP]
[CLS] following his research on general relativity , einstein entered into a series of attempts to general ##ize his geometric theory of gr ##avi ##tation to include electro ##ma ##gne ##tism as another aspect of a single entity . [SEP]
[CLS] although he continued to be lauded for his work , einstein became increasingly isolated in his research , and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful . [SEP]
[CLS] in his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces , einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics , most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces , which were not well understood until many years after his death . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein ' s dream of un ##ifying other laws of physics with gravity mo ##tiv ##ates modern quest ##s for a theory of everything and in particular string theory , where geometric ##al fields emerge in a unified quantum - mechanical setting . [SEP]
[CLS] they confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate , because the electron ' s angular momentum changes as the magnet ##ization changes . [SEP]
[CLS] this experiment needed to be sensitive , because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small , but it definitive ##ly established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnet ##ization . [SEP]
[CLS] quan ##ti ##zing these os ##ci ##lla ##tors , each level will have an integer occupation number , which will be the number of particles in it . [SEP]
[CLS] their invention was not immediately put into commercial production , and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the swedish company electro ##lux . [SEP]
[CLS] while traveling , einstein wrote daily to his wife elsa and adopted step ##da ##ught ##ers margot and il ##se . [SEP]
[CLS] margot einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public , but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death ( she died in 1986 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein had expressed his interest in the plumbing profession and was made an honorary member of the plum ##bers and steam ##fi ##tters union . [SEP]
[CLS] co ##rb ##is , successor to the roger rich ##man agency , licenses the use of his name and associated imagery , as agent for the university . [SEP]
[CLS] in the period before world war ii , " the new yorker " published a vi ##gne ##tte in their " the talk of the town " feature saying that einstein was so well known in america that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain " that theory " . [SEP]
[CLS] he finally figured out a way to handle the inc ##ess ##ant inquiries . [SEP]
[CLS] he is a favorite model for depictions of mad scientists and absent - minded professors ; his expressive face and distinctive hairs ##tyle have been widely copied and exaggerated . [SEP]
[CLS] einstein received numerous awards and honors , and in 1922 , he was awarded the 1921 nobel prize in physics " for his services to theoretical physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photo ##ele ##ctric effect " . [SEP]
