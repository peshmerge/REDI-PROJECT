The world premiere of "La bohème" was in Turin on 1 February 1896 at the Teatro Regio, conducted by the 28-year-old Arturo Toscanini.
Since then, "La bohème" has become part of the standard Italian opera repertory and is one of the most frequently performed operas worldwide.
It is the only recording ever made of a Puccini opera by its original conductor (see "Recording history" below).
According to its title page, the libretto of "La bohème" is based on Henri Murger's novel, "Scènes de la vie de bohème", a collection of vignettes portraying young bohemians living in the Latin Quarter of Paris in the 1840s.
Like the 1849 play by Murger and Théodore Barrière, the opera's libretto focuses on the relationship between Rodolfo and Mimì, ending with her death.
Also like the play, the libretto combines two characters from the novel, Mimì and Francine, into the single character of Mimì.
Early in the composition stage Puccini was in dispute with the composer Leoncavallo, who said that he had offered Puccini a completed libretto and felt that Puccini should defer to him.
Puccini responded that he had had no idea of Leoncavallo's interest and that having been working on his own version for some time, he felt that he could not oblige him by discontinuing with the opera.
The main plots of acts two and three are the librettists' invention, with only a few passing references to incidents and characters in Murger.
Most of acts one and four follow the novel, piecing together episodes from various chapters.
The final scenes in acts one and four—the scenes with Rodolfo and Mimì—resemble both the play and the novel.
The story of their meeting closely follows chapter 18 of the novel, in which the two lovers living in the garret are not Rodolphe and Mimì at all, but rather Jacques and Francine.
The story of Mimì's death in the opera draws from two different chapters in the novel, one relating Francine's death and the other relating Mimì's.
The published libretto includes a note from the librettists briefly discussing their adaptation.
At the time, the novel was in the public domain, Murger having died without heirs, but rights to the play were still controlled by Barrière's heirs.
The world première performance of "La bohème" took place in Turin on 1 February 1896 at the Teatro Regio and was conducted by the young Arturo Toscanini.
Despite this varied introductory response, the opera quickly became popular throughout Italy and productions were soon mounted by the following companies: The Teatro di San Carlo (14 March 1896, with Elisa Petri as Musetta and Antonio Magini-Coletti as Marcello); The Teatro Comunale di Bologna (4 November 1896, with Amelia Sedelmayer as Musetta and Umberto Beduschi as Rodolfo); The Teatro Costanzi (17 November 1896, with Maria Stuarda Savelli as Mimì, Enrico Giannini-Grifoni as Rodolfo, and Maurizio Bensaude as Marcello); La Scala (15 March 1897, with Angelica Pandolfini as Mimì, Camilla Pasini as Musetta, Fernando De Lucia as Rodolfo, and Edoardo Camera as Marcello); La Fenice (26 December 1897, with Emilia Merolla as Mimì, Maria Martelli as Musetta, Giovanni Apostolu and Franco Mannucci as Rodolfo, and Ferruccio Corradetti as Marcello); Teatro Regio di Parma (29 January 1898, with Solomiya Krushelnytska as Mimì, Lina Cassandro as Musetta, Pietro Ferrari as Rodolfo, and Pietro Giacomello as Marcello); Paris Opera (13 June 1898); and the Teatro Donizetti di Bergamo (21 August 1898, with Emilia Corsi as Mimì, Annita Barone as Musetta, Giovanni Apostolu as Rodolfo, and Giovanni Roussel as Marcello).
The first performance of "La bohème" outside Italy was at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 16 June 1896.
The United Kingdom premiere took place at the Theatre Royal in Manchester, on 22 April 1897, in a presentation by the Carl Rosa Opera Company supervised by Puccini.
This performance was given in English and starred Alice Esty as Mimì, Bessie McDonald as Musetta, Robert Cunningham as Rodolfo, and William Paull as Marcello.
On 2 October 1897 the same company gave the opera's first staging at the Royal Opera House in London and on 14 October 1897 in Los Angeles for the opera's United States premiere.
The opera reached New York City on 16 May 1898 when it was performed at Wallack's Theatre with Giuseppe Agostini as Rodolfo.
The first production of the opera actually produced by the Royal Opera House itself premiered on 1 July 1899 with Nellie Melba as Mimì, Zélie de Lussan as Musetta, Fernando De Lucia as Rodolfo, and Mario Ancona as Marcello.
"La bohème" premiered in Germany at the Kroll Opera House in Berlin on 22 June 1897.
The production used a French translation by Paul Ferrier and starred Julia Guiraudon as Mimì, Jeanne Tiphaine as Musetta, Adolphe Maréchal as Rodolfo, and Lucien Fugère as Marcello.
"La bohème" continued to gain international popularity throughout the early 20th century and the Opéra-Comique alone had already presented the opera one hundred times by 1903.
The Belgian premiere took place at La Monnaie on 25 October 1900 using Ferrier's French translation with Marie Thiérry as Mimì, Léon David as Rodolfo, Eugène-Charles Badiali as Marcello, sets by Pierre Devis, Armand Lynen, and Albert Dubosq, and Philippe Flon conducting.
The Metropolitan Opera staged the work for the first time on 26 December 1900 with Nellie Melba as Mimì, Annita Occhiolini-Rizzini as Musetta, Albert Saléza as Rodolfo, Giuseppe Campanari as Marcello, and Luigi Mancinelli conducting.
The opera was first performed in Brazil at the Theatro da Paz in Belém on 21 April 1900 with the Brazilian soprano Tilde Maragliano as Mimì, Maria Cavallini as Musetta, Giuseppe Agostini as Rodolfo and Alessandro Modesti as Marcello.
The conductor was Giorgio Polacco
The following year "La bohème" was presented at the Teatro Amazonas in Manaus, Brazil, on 2 July 1901 with Elvira Miotti as Mimì, Mabel Nelma as Musetta, Michele Sigaldi as Rodolfo, and Enrico De Franceschi as Marcello.
Puccini died in Brussels on 29 November 1924, and the news of his death reached Rome during a performance of "La bohème".
The opera was immediately stopped, and the orchestra played Chopin's "Funeral March" for the stunned audience.
However, that festival has not shown much interest in the operas of Puccini, only ever having one production each of "Tosca" and "Turandot" in its entire history.
"In the four bohemians' garret (Christmas Eve)"
Marcello is painting while Rodolfo gazes out of the window.
He explains the source of his riches: a job with an eccentric English gentleman, who ordered him to play his violin to a parrot until it died.
Schaunard interrupts, telling them that they must save the food for the days ahead: tonight they will all celebrate his good fortune by dining at Cafe Momus, and he will pay.
The friends are interrupted by Benoît, the landlord, who arrives to collect the rent.
In his drunkenness, he begins to boast of his amorous adventures, but when he also reveals that he is married, they thrust him from the room—without the rent payment—in comic moral indignation.
She is briefly overcome with faintness, and Rodolfo helps her to a chair and offers her a glass of wine.
Her candle goes out in the draught and Rodolfo's candle goes out too; the pair stumble in the dark.
Rodolfo, eager to spend time with the girl, to whom he is already attracted, finds the key and pockets it, feigning innocence.
The girl says her name is Mimì ("Sì, mi chiamano Mimì"—"Yes, they call me Mimì"), and describes her simple life as an embroiderer.
The friends arrive; Rodolfo buys Mimì a bonnet from a vendor, while Colline buys a coat and Schaunard a horn.
Parisians gossip with friends and bargain with the vendors; the children of the streets clamor to see the wares of Parpignol, the toy seller.
As the men and Mimì dine at the cafe, Musetta, formerly Marcello's sweetheart, arrives with her rich (and elderly) government minister admirer, Alcindoro, whom she is tormenting.
To the delight of the Parisians and the embarrassment of her patron, she sings a risqué song (Musetta's waltz: "Quando m'en vo'"—"When I go along"), hoping to reclaim Marcello's attention.
To be rid of Alcindoro for a bit, Musetta pretends to be suffering from a tight shoe and sends him to the shoemaker to get her shoe mended.
The sly Musetta has the entire bill charged to Alcindoro.
The sound of a military band is heard, and the friends leave.
She tries to find Marcello, who is currently living in a little tavern where he paints signs for the innkeeper.
She tells him of her hard life with Rodolfo, who abandoned her the night before, and of Rodolfo's terrible jealousy ("O buon Marcello, aiuto!
Marcello tells her that Rodolfo is asleep inside, and expresses concern about Mimì's cough.
Mimì hides and overhears Rodolfo first telling Marcello that he left Mimì because of her coquettishness, but finally confessing that his jealousy is a sham: he fears she is slowly being consumed by a deadly illness (most likely tuberculosis, known by the catchall name "consumption" in the nineteenth century).
Rodolfo, in his poverty, can do little to help Mimì and hopes that his pretended unkindness will inspire her to seek another, wealthier suitor ("Marcello, finalmente"—"Marcello, finally").
Out of kindness towards Mimì, Marcello tries to silence him, but she has already heard all.
Musetta's laughter is heard and Marcello goes to find out what has happened.
Mimì tells Rodolfo that she is leaving him, and asks that they separate amicably (Mimì: "Donde lieta uscì"—"From here she happily left"); but their love for one another is too strong for the pair to part.
As a compromise, they agree to remain together until the spring, when the world is coming to life again and no one feels truly alone.
"Back in the garret (some months later)" Marcello and Rodolfo are trying to work, though they are primarily talking about their girlfriends, who have left them and found wealthy lovers.
Rodolfo has seen Musetta in a fine carriage and Marcello has seen Mimì dressed like a queen.
Schaunard and Colline arrive with a very frugal dinner and all parody eating a plentiful banquet, dance together and sing, before Schaunard and Colline engage in a mock duel.
Musetta suddenly appears; Mimì, who took up with a wealthy viscount after leaving Rodolfo in the spring, has left her patron.
Musetta found her that day in the street, severely weakened by her illness, and Mimì begged Musetta to bring her to Rodolfo.
Schaunard leaves with Colline to give Mimì and Rodolfo some time together.
Mimì gently thanks Rodolfo for the muff, which she believes is a present from him, reassures him that she is better and falls asleep.
Rodolfo rushes to the bed, calling Mimì's name in anguish, weeping helplessly as the curtain falls.
The discography of "La bohème" is a long one with many distinguished recordings, including the 1972 Decca recording conducted by Herbert von Karajan with Luciano Pavarotti as Rodolfo and Mirella Freni as Mimì (made before Pavarotti became an international superstar of opera), and the 1973 RCA Victor recording conducted by Sir Georg Solti with Montserrat Caballé as Mimì and Plácido Domingo as Rodolfo which won the 1974 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording.
One of the most recent is the 2008 Deutsche Grammophon release conducted by Bertrand de Billy with Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón as Mimì and Rodolfo.
In the 1946 RCA Victor recording, Arturo Toscanini, who conducted the world premiere of the opera, conducts the NBC Symphony Orchestra with Jan Peerce as Rodolfo and Licia Albanese as Mimì.
Thomas Beecham, who worked closely with Puccini when preparing a 1920 production of "La bohème" in London, conducted a performance of the opera in English released by Columbia Records in 1936 with Lisa Perli as Mimì and Heddle Nash as Rodolfo.
Although the vast majority of recordings are in the original Italian, the opera has been recorded in several other languages.
These include: a recording in French conducted by Erasmo Ghiglia with Renée Doria and Alain Vanzo as Mimì and Rodolfo (1960); a recording in German with Richard Kraus conducting the Deutsche Oper Berlin Orchestra and Chorus with Trude Eipperle and Fritz Wunderlich as Mimì and Rodolfo (1956); and the 1998 release on the Chandos Opera in English label with David Parry conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra and Cynthia Haymon and Dennis O'Neill as Mimì and Rodolfo.
Enrico Caruso, who was closely associated with the role of Rodolfo, recorded the famous aria "Che gelida manina" in 1906.
Record Company released a six LP set with 101 different tenors singing the aria.
The "missing act" is located in the timeline between the Café Momus scene and act 3 and describes an open-air party at Musetta's dwelling.
Her protector has refused to pay further rent out of jealous feelings, and Musetta's furniture is moved into the courtyard to be auctioned off the following morning.
The pair dances a quadrille in the courtyard, which moves Rodolfo to jealousy.
Earlier, it was used for another song, "One Night of Love".
In 1969 in Paris, American free-jazz pianist Dave Burrell recorded his "La Vie de Bohème" with a seven-piece group of European and American musicians.
The music on the double-LP is improvised and experimental, but the listener can still discern Puccini's themes, as well as the narrative arc of the complete opera.
Here the lovers, Roger and Mimi, are faced with AIDS and progress through the action with songs such as "Light My Candle", which have direct reference to "La bohème".
the character Angel is given the surname "Schunard"), and at another point in the play, Roger's roommate and best friend Mark makes a wry reference to "Musetta's Waltz", which is a recurring theme throughout the first act and is played at the end of the second act.
A short parody, "The One-Minute, Non-Musical La Boheme for One or More Actors", by Meron Langsner was published by McSweeney's Internet Tendency in 2012.
According to Luhrmann, this version was set in 1957 (rather than the original period of 1830) because "...they discovered that 1957 was a very, very accurate match for the social and economic realities of Paris in the 1840s."
In 2002, Luhrmann restaged his version on Broadway, the production won two Tony Awards out of six nominations; for Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design as well as a special award, the Tony Honor for Excellence in Theatre.
To play the eight performances per week on Broadway, three casts of Mimìs and Rodolfos, and two Musettas and Marcellos, were used in rotation.
The production was set in present-day North London, specifically in the Kilburn area, which is described as one "of pound shops and betting shops, casual labour and cheap sublets.
A nice "verismo" touch, this—it also has the highest rate of tuberculosis infection in Greater London."
Although acts 1, 3 and 4 of this production took place in the pub's tiny upstairs theatre, for act 2 the entire audience and cast moved downstairs to the pub itself, with the pub's patrons serving as extras in the Cafe Momus scene.
In 2010 it transferred to the West End's Soho Theatre for two sell-out seasons and won a Laurence Olivier Award.
