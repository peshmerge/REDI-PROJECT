[CLS] la bo ##hem ##e ( ] , ] ) is an opera in four acts , composed by giacomo pu ##cci ##ni to an italian libretto by luigi ill ##ica and giuseppe gia ##cos ##a , based on " scenes de la vie de bo ##hem ##e " by henri mu ##rger . [SEP]
[CLS] the world premiere of " la bo ##hem ##e " was in turin on 1 february 1896 at the teatro reg ##io , conducted by the 28 - year - old arturo to ##scan ##ini . [SEP]
[CLS] since then , " la bo ##hem ##e " has become part of the standard italian opera repertory and is one of the most frequently performed operas worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1946 , fifty years after the opera ' s premiere , to ##scan ##ini conducted a commemorative performance of it on radio with the nbc symphony orchestra . [SEP]
[CLS] a recording of the performance was later released by rca victor on vinyl record , tape and compact disc . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the only recording ever made of a pu ##cci ##ni opera by its original conductor ( see " recording history " below ) . [SEP]
[CLS] according to its title page , the libretto of " la bo ##hem ##e " is based on henri mu ##rger ' s novel , " scenes de la vie de bo ##hem ##e " , a collection of vi ##gne ##ttes portraying young bohemian ##s living in the latin quarter of paris in the 1840s . [SEP]
[CLS] although usually called a novel , it has no unified plot . [SEP]
[CLS] like the 1849 play by mu ##rger and theodore barrier ##e , the opera ' s libretto focuses on the relationship between rod ##olf ##o and mimi , ending with her death . [SEP]
[CLS] also like the play , the libretto combines two characters from the novel , mimi and fran ##cine , into the single character of mimi . [SEP]
[CLS] early in the composition stage pu ##cci ##ni was in dispute with the composer leon ##ca ##val ##lo , who said that he had offered pu ##cci ##ni a completed libretto and felt that pu ##cci ##ni should def ##er to him . [SEP]
[CLS] pu ##cci ##ni responded that he had had no idea of leon ##ca ##val ##lo ' s interest and that having been working on his own version for some time , he felt that he could not ob ##li ##ge him by disco ##nti ##nu ##ing with the opera . [SEP]
[CLS] leon ##ca ##val ##lo completed his own version in which marcel ##lo was sung by a tenor and rod ##olf ##o by a baritone . [SEP]
[CLS] it was unsuccessful and is now rarely performed . [SEP]
[CLS] much of the libretto is original . [SEP]
[CLS] the main plots of acts two and three are the libre ##tti ##sts ' invention , with only a few passing references to incidents and characters in mu ##rger . [SEP]
[CLS] most of acts one and four follow the novel , pie ##cing together episodes from various chapters . [SEP]
[CLS] the final scenes in acts one and four — the scenes with rod ##olf ##o and mimi — resemble both the play and the novel . [SEP]
[CLS] the story of their meeting closely follows chapter 18 of the novel , in which the two lovers living in the ga ##rret are not rod ##ol ##ph ##e and mimi at all , but rather jacques and fran ##cine . [SEP]
[CLS] the story of mimi ' s death in the opera draws from two different chapters in the novel , one relating fran ##cine ' s death and the other relating mimi ' s . [SEP]
[CLS] the published libretto includes a note from the libre ##tti ##sts briefly discussing their adaptation . [SEP]
[CLS] without mentioning the play directly , they defend their con ##fl ##ation of fran ##cine and mimi into a single character : " chi pu ##o non con ##fo ##nder ##e ne ##l del ##ica ##to prof ##ilo di una sol ##a donna que ##lli di mimi e di fran ##cine ? " [SEP]
[CLS] ( " who cannot confuse in the delicate profile of one woman the personality both of mimi and of fran ##cine ? " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time , the novel was in the public domain , mu ##rger having died without heirs , but rights to the play were still controlled by barrier ##e ' s heirs . [SEP]
[CLS] the world premiere performance of " la bo ##hem ##e " took place in turin on 1 february 1896 at the teatro reg ##io and was conducted by the young arturo to ##scan ##ini . [SEP]
