[CLS] birds , also known as ave ##s or av ##ian dinosaurs , are a group of end ##oth ##er ##mic ve ##rte ##brates , characterised by feathers , tooth ##less beak ##ed jaws , the laying of hard - shell ##ed eggs , a high metabolic rate , a four - chamber ##ed heart , and a strong yet lightweight skeleton . [SEP]
[CLS] they rank as the world ' s most numerical ##ly - successful class of te ##tra ##pods , with approximately ten thousand living species , more than half of these being pass ##erine ##s , sometimes known as perch ##ing birds . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species ; the only known groups without wings are the extinct mo ##a and elephant birds . [SEP]
[CLS] wings , which evolved from fore ##lim ##bs , gave birds the ability to fly , although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in flight ##less birds , including rat ##ites , penguins , and diverse endemic island species of birds . [SEP]
[CLS] the fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feather ##ed dinosaurs , having evolved from earlier feather ##ed dinosaurs within the the ##rop ##od group , which are traditionally placed within the sa ##uri ##sch ##ian dinosaurs . [SEP]
[CLS] primitive bird - like dinosaurs that lie outside class ave ##s proper , in the broader group av ##ial ##ae , have been found dating back to the mid - jurassic period , around 170 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] many of these early " stem - birds " , such as " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x " , retained primitive characteristics such as teeth and long bony tails . [SEP]
[CLS] dna - based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the cretaceous – pal ##ae ##ogen ##e extinction event 66 million years ago , which killed off the pt ##eros ##aur ##s and all the non - av ##ian dinosaur lineage ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] but birds , especially those in the southern continents , survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while divers ##ifying during periods of global cooling . [SEP]
[CLS] some birds , especially co ##r ##vid ##s and parrot ##s , are among the most intelligent animals ; several bird species make and use tools , and many social species pass on knowledge across generations , which is considered a form of culture . [SEP]
[CLS] the vast majority of bird species are socially mono ##gam ##ous ( referring to social living arrangement , distinct from genetic mono ##gam ##y ) , usually for one breeding season at a time , sometimes for years , but rarely for life . [SEP]
[CLS] other species have breeding systems that are poly ##gy ##nous ( arrangement of one male with many females ) or , rarely , poly ##and ##rous ( arrangement of one female with many males ) . [SEP]
[CLS] most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatch ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] some birds , such as hen ##s , lay eggs even when not fe ##rti ##lis ##ed , though un ##fer ##ti ##lis ##ed eggs do not produce offspring . [SEP]
[CLS] many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing , with domestic ##ated and undo ##mes ##tica ##ted birds ( poultry and game ) being important sources of eggs , meat , and feathers . [SEP]
[CLS] ave ##s and a sister group , the order cr ##oco ##di ##lia , contain the only living representatives of the rep ##tile clade arch ##osa ##uria . [SEP]
[CLS] during the late 1990s , ave ##s was most commonly defined phylogenetic ##ally as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x lit ##hog ##raphic ##a " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , an earlier definition proposed by jacques ga ##uth ##ier gained wide currency in the 21st century , and is used by many scientists including adherents of the ph ##yl ##oco ##de system . [SEP]
[CLS] ga ##uth ##ier defined ave ##s to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds . [SEP]
[CLS] this was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils , and assign ##ing them , instead , to the av ##ial ##ae , in part to avoid the uncertain ##ties about the placement of " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x " in relation to animals traditionally thought of as the ##rop ##od dinosaurs . [SEP]
[CLS] ga ##uth ##ier identified four different definitions for the same biological name " ave ##s " , which is a problem . [SEP]
[CLS] ga ##uth ##ier proposed to reserve the term ave ##s only for the crown group consisting of the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants , which corresponds to meaning number 4 below . [SEP]
[CLS] ga ##uth ##ier ' s proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of pal ##ae ##ont ##ology and bird evolution , though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent . [SEP]
[CLS] av ##ial ##ae , initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of ave ##s , is often used synonymous ##ly with the vernacular term " bird " by these researchers . [SEP]
[CLS] jacques ga ##uth ##ier , who named av ##ial ##ae in 1986 , re - defined it in 2001 as all dinosaurs that possessed feather ##ed wings used in flap ##ping flight , and the birds that descended from them . [SEP]
[CLS] based on fossil and biological evidence , most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of the ##rop ##od dinosaurs , and more specifically , they are members of mani ##ra ##pt ##ora , a group of the ##rop ##ods which includes dr ##oma ##eo ##sau ##rs and o ##vira ##pt ##ori ##ds , among others . [SEP]
[CLS] as scientists have discovered more the ##rop ##ods closely related to birds , the previously clear distinction between non - birds and birds has become blurred . [SEP]
[CLS] recent discoveries in the lia ##oning province of northeast china , which demonstrate many small the ##rop ##od feather ##ed dinosaurs , contribute to this ambiguity . [SEP]
[CLS] the consensus view in contemporary pal ##ae ##ont ##ology is that the flying the ##rop ##ods , or av ##ial ##ans , are the closest relatives of the dei ##non ##ych ##osa ##urs , which include dr ##oma ##eo ##sau ##rid ##s and tr ##ood ##ont ##ids . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x " and the non - av ##ial ##an feather ##ed dinosaurs , who primarily ate meat , recent studies suggest that the first av ##ial ##ans were om ##ni ##vor ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] the late jurassic " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x " is well known as one of the first transitional fossils to be found , and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not considered a direct ancestor of birds , though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest known av ##ial ##an fossils come from the tia ##oj ##isha ##n formation of china , which has been dated to the late jurassic period ( oxford ##ian stage ) , about 160 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] many of these early av ##ial ##ans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds , but were later lost during bird evolution . [SEP]
[CLS] these features include enlarged claws on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life , and long feathers or " hind wings " covering the hind limbs and feet , which may have been used in aerial maneuver ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] many groups retained primitive characteristics , such as clawed wings and teeth , though the latter were lost independently in a number of av ##ial ##an groups , including modern birds ( ave ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] while the earliest forms , such as " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x " and " je ##hol ##orn ##is " , retained the long bony tails of their ancestors , the tails of more advanced av ##ial ##ans were shortened with the advent of the p ##y ##gos ##tyle bone in the group p ##y ##gos ##ty ##lia . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late cretaceous , about 100 million years ago , the ancestors of all modern birds evolved a more open pe ##lvis , allowing them to lay larger eggs compared to body size . [SEP]
[CLS] the first large , diverse lineage of short - tailed av ##ial ##ans to evolve were the en ##ant ##ior ##ni ##thes , or " opposite birds " , so named because the construction of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds . [SEP]
[CLS] while they were the dominant group of av ##ial ##ans during the cretaceous period , en ##ant ##ior ##ni ##thes became extinct along with many other dinosaur groups at the end of the me ##so ##zo ##ic era . [SEP]
[CLS] many species of the second major av ##ial ##an lineage to divers ##ify , the eu ##orn ##ith ##es ( meaning " true birds " , because they include the ancestors of modern birds ) , were semi - aquatic and specialised in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike the en ##ant ##ior ##ni ##thes , which dominated land - based and arbor ##eal habitats , most early eu ##orn ##ith ##es lacked perch ##ing adaptations and seem to have included shore ##bird - like species , wade ##rs , and swimming and diving species . [SEP]
[CLS] the latter included the superficial ##ly gu ##ll - like " ich ##thy ##orn ##is " and the he ##sper ##orn ##ith ##iform ##es , which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic . [SEP]
[CLS] the early eu ##orn ##ith ##es also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds , like strongly keel ##ed breast ##bone ##s , tooth ##less , beak ##ed portions of their jaws ( though most non - av ##ian eu ##orn ##ith ##es retained teeth in other parts of the jaws ) . [SEP]
[CLS] eu ##orn ##ith ##es also included the first av ##ial ##ans to develop true p ##y ##gos ##tyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers , which may have replaced the " hind wing " as the primary mode of aerial maneuver ##ability and braking in flight . [SEP]
[CLS] as both species are small aerial and canopy foraging om ##ni ##vor ##es , a similar ecological niche was in ##fer ##red for this hypothetical ancestor . [SEP]
[CLS] all modern birds lie within the crown group ave ##s ( alternately neo ##rn ##ith ##es ) , which has two subdivisions : the pal ##ae ##og ##nath ##ae , which includes the flight ##less rat ##ites ( such as the os ##tric ##hes ) and the weak - flying tina ##mous , and the extremely diverse neo ##gna ##tha ##e , containing all other birds . [SEP]
[CLS] these two subdivisions are often given the rank of super ##ord ##er , although live ##ze ##y and zu ##si assigned them " co ##hort " rank . [SEP]
[CLS] the af ##fin ##ities of an earlier fossil , the possible gall ##iform " austin ##orn ##is lent ##us " , dated to about 85 million years ago , are still too controversial to provide a fossil evidence of modern bird divers ##ification . [SEP]
[CLS] this disagreement is in part caused by a diver ##gence in the evidence ; most molecular dating studies suggests a cretaceous radiation , while fossil evidence points to a ce ##no ##zo ##ic radiation ( the so - called ' rocks ' versus ' clocks ' controversy ) . [SEP]
[CLS] previous attempts to reconcile molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial , but more recent estimates , using a more comprehensive sample of fossils and a new way of cal ##ib ##rating molecular clocks , showed that while modern birds originated early in the late cretaceous , a pulse of divers ##ification in all major groups occurred around the cretaceous – pal ##ae ##ogen ##e extinction event . [SEP]
[CLS] most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate , but scientists disagree about the relationships between the orders themselves ; evidence from modern bird anatomy , fossils and dna have all been brought to bear on the problem , but no strong consensus has emerged . [SEP]
[CLS] more recently , new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders . [SEP]
[CLS] birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven continents , reaching their southern extreme in the snow pet ##rel ' s breeding colonies up to 440 km inland in antarctica . [SEP]
[CLS] it was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher spec ##iation rates in the tr ##op ##ics ; however recent studies found higher spec ##iation rates in the high latitude ##s that were offset by greater extinction rates than in the tr ##op ##ics . [SEP]
[CLS] several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world ' s oceans and in them , with some sea ##bird species coming ashore only to breed and some penguins have been recorded diving up to 300 m deep . [SEP]
[CLS] some of these introductions have been deliberate ; the ring - neck ##ed ph ##ea ##sant , for example , has been introduced around the world as a game bird . [SEP]
[CLS] others have been accidental , such as the establishment of wild monk para ##kee ##ts in several north american cities after their escape from captivity . [SEP]
[CLS] some species , including cattle e ##gre ##t , yellow - headed cara ##car ##a and gala ##h , have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat . [SEP]
[CLS] the spine has cervical , thor ##ac ##ic , lu ##mba ##r and ca ##uda ##l regions with the number of cervical ( neck ) vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible , but movement is reduced in the anterior thor ##ac ##ic vertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae . [SEP]
[CLS] the ribs are flattened and the stern ##um is keel ##ed for the attachment of flight muscles except in the flight ##less bird orders . [SEP]
[CLS] the wings are more or less developed depending on the species ; the only known groups that lost their wings are the extinct mo ##a and elephant birds . [SEP]
[CLS] like the reptiles , birds are primarily ur ##ico ##tel ##ic , that is , their kidney ##s extract nitrogen ##ous waste from their blood ##stream and ex ##cre ##te it as ur ##ic acid instead of ur ##ea or ammonia through the ur ##eter ##s into the int ##est ##ine . [SEP]
[CLS] birds do not have a ur ##ina ##ry bladder or external ur ##eth ##ral opening and ( with exception of the os ##tric ##h ) ur ##ic acid is ex ##cre ##ted along with fae ##ces as a semi ##sol ##id waste . [SEP]
[CLS] however , birds such as humming ##birds can be fa ##cu ##lta ##tively am ##mon ##ote ##lic , ex ##cre ##ting most of the nitrogen ##ous waste ##s as ammonia . [SEP]
[CLS] this material , as well as the output of the int ##est ##ines , emerges from the bird ' s cl ##oa ##ca . [SEP]
[CLS] the cl ##oa ##ca is a multi - purpose opening : waste is expelled through it , most birds mate by joining cl ##oa ##ca , and females lay eggs from it . [SEP]
[CLS] males within pal ##ae ##og ##nath ##ae ( with the exception of the ki ##wi ##s ) , the an ##ser ##iform ##es ( with the exception of scream ##ers ) , and in ru ##diment ##ary forms in gall ##iform ##es ( but fully developed in cr ##ac ##idae ) possess a penis , which is never present in neo ##aves . [SEP]
[CLS] the digest ##ive system of birds is unique , with a crop for storage and a gi ##zza ##rd that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies , including protein from the int ##est ##ines , as additional energy during migration . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups . [SEP]
[CLS] upon in ##hala ##tion , 75 % of the fresh air bypass ##es the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air . [SEP]
[CLS] when the bird ex ##hale ##s , the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs . [SEP]
[CLS] sound production is achieved using the sy ##rin ##x , a muscular chamber incorporating multiple ty ##mp ##ani ##c membranes which diver ##ges from the lower end of the tr ##ache ##a ; the tr ##ache ##a being elongated in some species , increasing the volume of vocal ##isation ##s and the perception of the bird ' s size . [SEP]
[CLS] the heart itself is divided into a right and left half , each with an atrium and vent ##ric ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] the atrium and vent ##ric ##les of each side are separated by at ##rio ##vent ##ric ##ular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction . [SEP]
[CLS] being my ##ogenic , the heart ' s pace is maintained by pace ##maker cells found in the sino ##at ##rial node , located on the right atrium . [SEP]
[CLS] much like a mammalian heart , the av ##ian heart is composed of end ##oca ##rdial , my ##oca ##rdial and epic ##ard ##ial layers . [SEP]
[CLS] the atrium walls tend to be thinner than the vent ##ric ##le walls , due to the intense vent ##ric ##ular contraction used to pump oxygen ##ated blood throughout the body . [SEP]
[CLS] av ##ian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have a very efficient system for di ##ff ##using oxygen into the blood ; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals . [SEP]
[CLS] the arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the vent ##ric ##ular con ##st ##ric ##tion , and become more rigid as they move away from the heart . [SEP]
[CLS] blood moves through the arteries , which undergo va ##so ##con ##st ##ric ##tion , and into arte ##rio ##les which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body . [SEP]
[CLS] as the arte ##rio ##les move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow . [SEP]
[CLS] blood travels through the arte ##rio ##les and moves into the cap ##illa ##ries where gas exchange can occur . [SEP]
[CLS] cap ##illa ##ries are organized into cap ##illa ##ry beds in tissues ; it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste . [SEP]
[CLS] once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium , then the right vent ##ric ##le to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen . [SEP]
[CLS] oxygen ##ated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left vent ##ric ##le where it is pumped out to the body . [SEP]
[CLS] the most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight - related functions , while the ce ##re ##bell ##um coordinates movement and the ce ##re ##br ##um controls behaviour patterns , navigation , mating and nest building . [SEP]
[CLS] most birds have a poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including ki ##wi ##s , new world vulture ##s and tube ##nos ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] birds are te ##tra ##ch ##romatic , possessing ultraviolet ( uv ) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green , red and blue ones . [SEP]
[CLS] many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye ; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers . [SEP]
[CLS] male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by post ##uring and raising of their nape feathers . [SEP]
[CLS] ultraviolet light is also used in foraging — ke ##strel ##s have been shown to search for prey by detecting the uv reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents . [SEP]
[CLS] with the exception of pigeons and a few other species , the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking . [SEP]
[CLS] instead the eye is lu ##bri ##cated by the nic ##ti ##tat ##ing membrane , a third eye ##lid that moves horizontally . [SEP]
[CLS] most birds cannot move their eyes , although there are exceptions , such as the great co ##rm ##oran ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] the av ##ian ear lacks external pin ##nae but is covered by feathers , although in some birds , such as the " as ##io " , " bu ##bo " and " ot ##us " owls , these feathers form tufts which resemble ears . [SEP]
[CLS] a few species are able to use chemical defences against predators ; some pro ##cel ##lar ##ii ##form ##es can e ##ject an unpleasant stomach oil against an ag ##gre ##sso ##r , and some species of pit ##oh ##uis from new guinea have a powerful ne ##uro ##to ##xin in their skin and feathers . [SEP]
[CLS] a lack of field observations limit our knowledge , but intra ##sp ##ec ##ific conflicts are known to sometimes result in injury or death . [SEP]
[CLS] feathers are ep ##ider ##mal growth ##s attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pt ##ery ##la ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] the distribution pattern of these feather tracts ( pt ##ery ##los ##is ) is used in taxonomy and systematic ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body , called plumage , may vary within species by age , social status , and sex . [SEP]
[CLS] plumage is regularly mo ##ult ##ed ; the standard plumage of a bird that has mo ##ult ##ed after breeding is known as the " non - breeding " plumage , or — in the humphrey - park ##es terminology — " basic " plumage ; breeding plumage ##s or variations of the basic plumage are known under the humphrey - park ##es system as " alternate " plumage ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##ult ##ing is annual in most species , although some may have two mo ##ult ##s a year , and large birds of prey may mo ##ult only once every few years . [SEP]
[CLS] in pass ##erine ##s , flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the inner ##most primary being the first . [SEP]
[CLS] after the inner ##most ter ##tia ##ries are mo ##ult ##ed , the second ##aries starting from the inner ##most begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers ( cent ##ri ##fu ##gal mo ##ult ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a small number of species , such as ducks and geese , lose all of their flight feathers at once , temporarily becoming flight ##less . [SEP]
[CLS] as a general rule , the tail feathers are mo ##ult ##ed and replaced starting with the inner ##most pair . [SEP]
[CLS] the cent ##ri ##fu ##gal mo ##ult is modified in the tail feathers of wood ##pe ##cker ##s and tree ##cre ##ep ##ers , in that it begins with the second inner ##most pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail . [SEP]
[CLS] the general pattern seen in pass ##erine ##s is that the primaries are replaced outward , second ##aries inward , and the tail from centre outward . [SEP]
[CLS] feathers require maintenance and birds pre ##en or groom them daily , spending an average of around 9 % of their daily time on this . [SEP]
[CLS] the bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply wax ##y secret ##ions from the ur ##op ##y ##gia ##l gland ; these secret ##ions protect the feathers ' flexibility and act as an anti ##mic ##ro ##bial agent , inhibit ##ing the growth of feather - de ##grad ##ing bacteria . [SEP]
[CLS] this may be supplemented with the secret ##ions of form ##ic acid from ants , which birds receive through a behaviour known as anti ##ng , to remove feather parasites . [SEP]
[CLS] most bird scales do not overlap significantly , except in the cases of king ##fish ##ers and wood ##pe ##cker ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have various adaptations for flight , including a lightweight skeleton , two large flight muscles , the pe ##ctor ##alis ( which accounts for 15 % of the total mass of the bird ) and the su ##pr ##aco ##rac ##oid ##eus , as well as a modified fore ##lim ##b ( wing ) that serves as an aero ##foil . [SEP]
[CLS] about 60 extant bird species are flight ##less , as were many extinct birds . [SEP]
[CLS] flight ##lessness often arises in birds on isolated islands , probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators . [SEP]
[CLS] most birds are di ##urn ##al , but some birds , such as many species of owls and night ##jar ##s , are nocturnal or cr ##ep ##us ##cular ( active during twilight hours ) , and many coastal wade ##rs feed when the tides are appropriate , by day or night . [SEP]
[CLS] birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called general ##ists , while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists . [SEP]
[CLS] nectar feeder ##s such as humming ##birds , sun ##birds , lori ##es , and lori ##kee ##ts amongst others have specially adapted brush ##y tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co - adapted flowers . [SEP]
[CLS] ki ##wi ##s and shore ##birds with long bills probe for invertebrates ; shore ##birds ' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niche ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##le ##pt ##opa ##ras ##itis ##m is thought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting , rather than a significant part of any species ' diet ; a study of great frigate ##birds stealing from masked boo ##bies estimated that the frigate ##birds stole at most 40 % of their food and on average stole only 5 % . [SEP]
[CLS] water is needed by many birds although their mode of ex ##cre ##tion and lack of sweat glands reduces the physiological demands . [SEP]
[CLS] they may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise , saving on moisture loss from eva ##por ##ative cooling or panting . [SEP]
[CLS] sea ##birds can drink sea ##water and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils . [SEP]
[CLS] some species , especially of arid zones , belonging to the pigeon , finch , mouse ##bird , button - qu ##ail and bust ##ard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads . [SEP]
[CLS] some desert birds depend on water sources and sand ##gr ##ouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at water ##holes . [SEP]
[CLS] nesting sand ##gr ##ouse and many pl ##overs carry water to their young by wet ##ting their belly feathers . [SEP]
[CLS] the pigeon family , flaming ##os and penguins have adaptations to produce a nut ##rit ##ive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks . [SEP]
[CLS] feathers being critical to the survival of a bird , require maintenance . [SEP]
[CLS] apart from physical wear and tear , feathers face the onslaught of fungi , ec ##top ##ara ##sit ##ic feather mit ##es and bird ##lice . [SEP]
[CLS] the physical condition of feathers are maintained by pre ##ening often with the application of secret ##ions from the pre ##en gland . [SEP]
[CLS] while some birds dip into shallow water , more aerial species may make aerial dip ##s into water and arbor ##eal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves . [SEP]
[CLS] a behaviour termed as anti ##ng in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ec ##top ##ara ##sit ##e load in feathers . [SEP]
[CLS] many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ec ##top ##ara ##sit ##ic activity that may lead to feather damage . [SEP]
[CLS] many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of seasonal temperatures , therefore opt ##imi ##sing availability of food sources and breeding habitat . [SEP]
[CLS] before migration , birds substantially increase body fat ##s and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs . [SEP]
[CLS] migration is highly demanding energetic ##ally , particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without ref ##uel ##ling . [SEP]
[CLS] some bird species undertake shorter migration ##s , travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food . [SEP]
[CLS] ir ##rup ##tive species such as the bore ##al finch ##es are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next . [SEP]
[CLS] species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range , with individuals from higher latitude ##s travelling into the existing range of con ##sp ##ec ##ific ##s ; others undertake partial migration ##s , where only a fraction of the population , usually females and sub ##dom ##ina ##nt males , migrate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] alt ##it ##udi ##nal migration is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during sub ##op ##ti ##mal conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] it is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become in ##hos ##pit ##able due to lack of food . [SEP]
[CLS] some species may also be nomadic , holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability . [SEP]
[CLS] the ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time ; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s , a man ##x shear ##water released in boston in the united states returned to its colony in sk ##ome ##r , in wales within 13 days , a distance of 51 ##50 km . [SEP]
[CLS] birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance , to display breeding condition in sexually selected species , or to make threatening displays , as in the sun ##bit ##tern ' s mimic ##ry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks . [SEP]
[CLS] variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds , particularly between species . [SEP]
[CLS] visual communication among birds may also involve ritual ##ised displays , which have developed from non - signalling actions such as pre ##ening , the adjustments of feather position , peck ##ing , or other behaviour . [SEP]
[CLS] the most elaborate displays occur during courtship , where " dances " are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements ; males ' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays . [SEP]
[CLS] this communication can be very complex ; some species can operate the two sides of the sy ##rin ##x independently , allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs . [SEP]
[CLS] calls are used for a variety of purposes , including mate attraction , evaluation of potential mates , bond formation , the claiming and maintenance of territories , the identification of other individuals ( such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season ) , and the warning of other birds of potential predators , sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat . [SEP]
[CLS] the " coe ##no ##cor ##yp ##ha " s ##ni ##pes of new zealand drive air through their feathers , wood ##pe ##cker ##s drum for long distance communication , and palm cock ##ato ##os use tools to drum . [SEP]
[CLS] defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests , where ambush pre ##dation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system . [SEP]
[CLS] this has led to the development of many mixed - species feeding flock ##s , which are usually composed of small numbers of many species ; these flock ##s provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources . [SEP]
[CLS] horn ##bill ##s have a mutual ##istic relationship with dwarf mon ##go ##oses , in which they for ##age together and warn each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators . [SEP]
[CLS] the high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times . [SEP]
[CLS] sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vi ##gil ##ant sleep , where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye - opening " peek ##s " , allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats . [SEP]
[CLS] swift ##s are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their ro ##ost ##ing flight . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight . [SEP]
[CLS] some birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into slow - wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time . [SEP]
[CLS] the birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock . [SEP]
[CLS] this may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vi ##gil ##ant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock . [SEP]
[CLS] communal ro ##ost ##ing is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators . [SEP]
[CLS] many birds rest on one leg , while some may pull up their legs into their feathers , especially in cold weather . [SEP]
[CLS] some humming ##birds go into a nightly state of tor ##por accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates . [SEP]
[CLS] birds do not have sweat glands , but they may cool themselves by moving to shade , standing in water , panting , increasing their surface area , fluttering their throat or by using special behaviour ##s like ur ##oh ##id ##rosis to cool themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] these species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or — in some cases — for several years or until the death of one mate . [SEP]
[CLS] mono ##gam ##y allows for both paternal care and bi ##par ##ental care , which is especially important for species in which females require males ' assistance for successful brood - rear ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males , but may also be the result of forced cop ##ulation in ducks and other ana ##ti ##ds . [SEP]
[CLS] female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after cop ##ulation , a hundred days in some species . [SEP]
[CLS] males of species that engage in extra - pair cop ##ulation ##s will closely guard their mates to ensure the parent ##age of the offspring that they raise . [SEP]
[CLS] homosexual behaviour has been observed in males or females in numerous species of birds , including cop ##ulation , pair - bonding , and joint parenting of chicks . [SEP]
[CLS] many birds actively defend a territory from others of the same species during the breeding season ; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks . [SEP]
[CLS] species that are unable to defend feeding territories , such as sea ##birds and swift ##s , often breed in colonies instead ; this is thought to offer protection from predators . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many exceptions to this pattern , however ; the ground - nesting night ##jar ##s have pale eggs , and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage . [SEP]
[CLS] some bird nests , however , are extremely primitive ; alba ##tro ##ss nests are no more than a scrape on the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] most birds build nests in sheltered , hidden areas to avoid pre ##dation , but large or colonial birds — which are more capable of defence — may build more open nests . [SEP]
[CLS] during nest construction , some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite - reducing toxin ##s to improve chick survival , and feathers are often used for nest insulation . [SEP]
[CLS] some bird species have no nests ; the cliff - nesting common gui ##lle ##mot lays its eggs on bare rock , and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet . [SEP]
[CLS] inc ##uba ##tion , which opt ##imi ##ses temperature for chick development , usually begins after the last egg has been laid . [SEP]
[CLS] in mono ##gam ##ous species inc ##uba ##tion duties are often shared , whereas in poly ##gam ##ous species one parent is wholly responsible for inc ##uba ##tion . [SEP]
[CLS] the warmth for the inc ##uba ##tion of the eggs of mega ##pod ##es comes from the sun , decay ##ing vegetation or volcanic sources . [SEP]
[CLS] helpless chicks are termed " alt ##ric ##ial " , and tend to be born small , blind , im ##mobile and naked ; chicks that are mobile and feather ##ed upon hatch ##ing are termed " pre ##co ##cial " . [SEP]
[CLS] the young of many bird species do not precisely fit into either the pre ##co ##cial or alt ##ric ##ial category , having some aspects of each and thus fall somewhere on an " alt ##ric ##ial - pre ##co ##cial spectrum " . [SEP]
[CLS] the length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species . [SEP]
[CLS] at one extreme , parental care in mega ##pod ##es ends at hatch ##ing ; the newly hatch ##ed chick dig ##s itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fen ##d for itself immediately . [SEP]
[CLS] at the other extreme , many sea ##birds have extended periods of parental care , the longest being that of the great frigate ##bird , whose chicks take up to six months to fled ##ge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months . [SEP]
[CLS] the " chick guard stage " describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatch ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] in some species , both parents care for nest ##lings and fledgling ##s ; in others , such care is the responsibility of only one sex . [SEP]
[CLS] in some species , other members of the same species — usually close relatives of the breeding pair , such as offspring from previous brood ##s — will help with the raising of the young . [SEP]
[CLS] such all ##opa ##rent ##ing is particularly common among the co ##r ##vid ##a , which includes such birds as the true crows , australian mag ##pie and fairy - wren ##s , but has been observed in species as different as the rifle ##man and red kite . [SEP]
[CLS] in birds , however , it is quite common — more so than in any other ve ##rte ##brate class . [SEP]
[CLS] although territory and nest site defence , inc ##uba ##tion , and chick feeding are often shared tasks , there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertake ##s all or most of a particular duty . [SEP]
[CLS] the chicks of the " synth ##lib ##ora ##mp ##hus " mu ##rre ##lets , like the ancient mu ##rre ##let , leave the nest the night after they hatch , following their parents out to sea , where they are raised away from terrestrial predators . [SEP]
[CLS] in most species , chicks leave the nest just before , or soon after , they are able to fly . [SEP]
[CLS] the amount of parental care after fled ##ging varies ; alba ##tro ##ss chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help , while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fled ##ging . [SEP]
[CLS] brood para ##sit ##ism , in which an egg - layer leaves her eggs with another individual ' s brood , is more common among birds than any other type of organism . [SEP]
[CLS] after a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird ' s nest , they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host ' s own brood . [SEP]
[CLS] brood parasites may be either " ob ##liga ##te brood parasites " , which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young , or " non - ob ##liga ##te brood parasites " , which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of con ##sp ##ec ##ific ##s to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have evolved a variety of mating behaviour ##s , with the peacock tail being perhaps the most famous example of sexual selection and the fisher ##ian runaway . [SEP]
[CLS] many types of av ##ian sexual selection have been identified ; inter ##se ##x ##ual selection , also known as female choice ; and intra ##se ##x ##ual competition , where individuals of the more abundant sex compete with each other for the privilege to mate . [SEP]
[CLS] sexually selected traits often evolve to become more pronounced in competitive breeding situations until the trait begins to limit the individual ' s fitness . [SEP]
[CLS] embryo survival ( that is , hatch ##ing success of fertile eggs ) was significantly lower for si ##b - si ##b mating pairs than for unrelated pairs . [SEP]
[CLS] inc ##est ##uous mating ##s by the purple - crowned fairy wren " mal ##urus corona ##tus " result in severe fitness costs due to in ##bre ##eding depression ( greater than 30 % reduction in hatch ##ability of eggs ) . [SEP]
[CLS] females paired with related males may undertake extra pair mating ##s ( see prom ##is ##cuit ##y # other animals for 90 % frequency in av ##ian species ) that can reduce the negative effects of in ##bre ##eding . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , 43 % of brood ##s produced by inc ##est ##uously paired females contained extra pair young . [SEP]
[CLS] in ##bre ##eding depression occurs in the great ti ##t ( " par ##us major " ) when the offspring produced as a result of a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness . [SEP]
[CLS] in natural populations of " par ##us major " , in ##bre ##eding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace , which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative . [SEP]
[CLS] the first is through dispersal , and the second is by avoiding familiar group members as mates . [SEP]
[CLS] cooperative breeding in birds typically occurs when offspring , usually males , delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin . [SEP]
[CLS] female offspring rarely stay at home , di ##sper ##sing over distances that allow them to breed independently , or to join unrelated groups . [SEP]
[CLS] even within a single habitat , such as a forest , the niche ##s occupied by different species of birds vary , with some species feeding in the forest canopy , others beneath the canopy , and still others on the forest floor . [SEP]
[CLS] birds of prey special ##ise in hunting mammals or other birds , while vulture ##s are specialised sc ##ave ##nger ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] aviv ##ores are animals that are specialised at prey ##ing on birds . [SEP]
[CLS] nesting sea ##birds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas , principally through the concentration of large quantities of gu ##ano , which may en ##rich the local soil and the surrounding seas . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes , these relationships are mutual ##istic , like the cooperative honey - gathering among honey ##guide ##s and african peoples such as the bo ##rana . [SEP]
[CLS] several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pest ##s , and some pose an aviation hazard . [SEP]
[CLS] human activities can also be detrimental , and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction ( hunting , av ##ian lead poisoning , pest ##icides , road ##kill , wind turbine kills and pre ##dation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds ) . [SEP]
[CLS] domestic ##ated birds raised for meat and eggs , called poultry , are the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans ; in 2003 , 76 million tons of poultry and 61 million tons of eggs were produced worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] many species of birds are also hunted for meat . [SEP]
[CLS] the most important birds hunted in north and south america are water ##fo ##wl ; other widely hunted birds include ph ##ea ##sant ##s , wild turkey ##s , qu ##ail , dove ##s , partridge , gr ##ouse , s ##ni ##pe , and wood ##cock . [SEP]
[CLS] other commercially valuable products from birds include feathers ( especially the down of geese and ducks ) , which are used as insulation in clothing and bed ##ding , and sea ##bird fae ##ces ( gu ##ano ) , which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen . [SEP]
[CLS] the war of the pacific , sometimes called the gu ##ano war , was fought in part over the control of gu ##ano deposits . [SEP]
[CLS] colourful birds , such as parrot ##s and my ##nas , are bred in captivity or kept as pets , a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species . [SEP]
[CLS] messenger pigeons , used since at least 1 ad , remained important as recently as world war ii . [SEP]
[CLS] today , such activities are more common either as ho ##bbies , for entertainment and tourism , or for sports such as pigeon racing . [SEP]
[CLS] bird feeding has grown into a multi ##mill ##ion - dollar industry ; for example , an estimated 75 % of households in britain provide food for birds at some point during the winter . [SEP]
[CLS] in religion , birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a deity , such as in the cult of make ##ma ##ke , in which the tang ##ata man ##u of easter island served as chiefs or as attendants , as in the case of hug ##in and mu ##nin , the two common ravens who whispered news into the ears of the norse god odin . [SEP]
[CLS] in several civil ##isation ##s of ancient italy , particularly et ##rus ##can and roman religion , priests were involved in aug ##ury , or interpreting the words of birds while the " aus ##pe ##x " ( from which the word " aus ##pic ##ious " is derived ) watched their activities to fore ##tell events . [SEP]
[CLS] in the ancient world , dove ##s were used as symbols of the mesopotamia ##n goddess ina ##nna ( later known as is ##hta ##r ) , the can ##aan ##ite mother goddess asher ##ah , and the greek goddess ap ##hr ##od ##ite . [SEP]
[CLS] in ancient greece , athena , the goddess of wisdom and patron deity of the city of athens , had a little owl as her symbol . [SEP]
[CLS] in religious images preserved from the inca and ti ##wana ##ku empires , birds are depicted in the process of trans ##gre ##ssing boundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have featured in culture and art since prehistoric times , when they were represented in early cave paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] some birds have been perceived as monsters , including the mythological roc and the maori ' s legendary " po ##ua ##kai " , a giant bird capable of snatch ##ing humans . [SEP]
[CLS] birds were later used as symbols of power , as in the magnificent peacock throne of the mughal and persian emperors . [SEP]
[CLS] among the most famous of these bird artists was john james au ##du ##bon , whose paintings of north american birds were a great commercial success in europe and who later lent his name to the national au ##du ##bon society . [SEP]
[CLS] birds are also important figures in poetry ; for example , homer incorporated nightingale ##s into his " odyssey " , and cat ##ull ##us used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his cat ##ull ##us 2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the relationship between an alba ##tro ##ss and a sailor is the central theme of samuel taylor cole ##ridge ' s " the rim ##e of the ancient marine ##r " , which led to the use of the term as a metaphor for a ' burden ' . [SEP]
[CLS] hoop ##oes were considered sacred in ancient egypt and symbols of virtue in persia , but were thought of as thieves across much of europe and ha ##rbin ##gers of war in scandinavia . [SEP]
[CLS] in music , birds ##ong has influenced composers and musicians in several ways : they can be inspired by birds ##ong ; they can intentionally im ##itate bird song in a composition , as viva ##ld ##i , mess ##iae ##n , and beethoven did , along with many later composers ; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works , as otto ##rino res ##pi ##ghi first did ; or like beatrice harrison and david roth ##enberg , they can duet with birds . [SEP]
[CLS] although human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species , such as the barn swallow and european star ##ling , they have caused population decreases or extinction in many other species . [SEP]
[CLS] many bird populations are declining worldwide , with 1 , 227 species listed as threatened by bird ##life international and the iucn in 2009 . [SEP]
[CLS] such projects have produced some successes ; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004 , including the california condor and norfolk para ##kee ##t . [SEP]
