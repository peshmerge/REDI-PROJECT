[CLS] birds , also known as ave ##s or av ##ian dinosaurs , are a group of end ##oth ##er ##mic ve ##rte ##brates , characterised by feathers , tooth ##less beak ##ed jaws , the laying of hard - shell ##ed eggs , a high metabolic rate , a four - chamber ##ed heart , and a strong yet lightweight skeleton . [SEP]
[CLS] birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm bee humming ##bird to the 2 . 75 m os ##tric ##h . [SEP]
[CLS] they rank as the world ' s most numerical ##ly - successful class of te ##tra ##pods , with approximately ten thousand living species , more than half of these being pass ##erine ##s , sometimes known as perch ##ing birds . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have wings which are more or less developed depending on the species ; the only known groups without wings are the extinct mo ##a and elephant birds . [SEP]
[CLS] wings , which evolved from fore ##lim ##bs , gave birds the ability to fly , although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in flight ##less birds , including rat ##ites , penguins , and diverse endemic island species of birds . [SEP]
[CLS] the digest ##ive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight . [SEP]
[CLS] some bird species of aquatic environments , particularly sea ##birds and some water ##birds , have further evolved for swimming . [SEP]
[CLS] the fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feather ##ed dinosaurs , having evolved from earlier feather ##ed dinosaurs within the the ##rop ##od group , which are traditionally placed within the sa ##uri ##sch ##ian dinosaurs . [SEP]
[CLS] the closest living relatives of birds are the cr ##oco ##di ##lian ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] primitive bird - like dinosaurs that lie outside class ave ##s proper , in the broader group av ##ial ##ae , have been found dating back to the mid - jurassic period , around 170 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] many of these early " stem - birds " , such as " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x " , retained primitive characteristics such as teeth and long bony tails . [SEP]
[CLS] dna - based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically around the time of the cretaceous – pal ##ae ##ogen ##e extinction event 66 million years ago , which killed off the pt ##eros ##aur ##s and all the non - av ##ian dinosaur lineage ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] but birds , especially those in the southern continents , survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while divers ##ifying during periods of global cooling . [SEP]
[CLS] this makes them the sole surviving dinosaurs according to clad ##istic ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] some birds , especially co ##r ##vid ##s and parrot ##s , are among the most intelligent animals ; several bird species make and use tools , and many social species pass on knowledge across generations , which is considered a form of culture . [SEP]
[CLS] many species annually migrate great distances . [SEP]
[CLS] birds are social , communicating with visual signals , calls , and bird songs , and participating in such social behaviour ##s as cooperative breeding and hunting , flock ##ing , and mob ##bing of predators . [SEP]
[CLS] the vast majority of bird species are socially mono ##gam ##ous ( referring to social living arrangement , distinct from genetic mono ##gam ##y ) , usually for one breeding season at a time , sometimes for years , but rarely for life . [SEP]
[CLS] other species have breeding systems that are poly ##gy ##nous ( arrangement of one male with many females ) or , rarely , poly ##and ##rous ( arrangement of one female with many males ) . [SEP]
[CLS] birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fe ##rti ##lis ##ed through sexual reproduction . [SEP]
[CLS] they are usually laid in a nest and inc ##uba ##ted by the parents . [SEP]
[CLS] most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatch ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] some birds , such as hen ##s , lay eggs even when not fe ##rti ##lis ##ed , though un ##fer ##ti ##lis ##ed eggs do not produce offspring . [SEP]
[CLS] many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing , with domestic ##ated and undo ##mes ##tica ##ted birds ( poultry and game ) being important sources of eggs , meat , and feathers . [SEP]
[CLS] song ##birds , parrot ##s , and other species are popular as pets . [SEP]
[CLS] gu ##ano ( bird ex ##cre ##ment ) is harvested for use as a fe ##rti ##lis ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] birds prominently figure throughout human culture . [SEP]
[CLS] about 120 – 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century , and hundreds more before then . [SEP]
[CLS] human activity threatens about 1 , 200 bird species with extinction , though efforts are underway to protect them . [SEP]
[CLS] recreational bird ##watch ##ing is an important part of the eco ##tour ##ism industry . [SEP]
[CLS] the first classification of birds was developed by francis will ##ugh ##by and john ray in their 167 ##6 volume " or ##ni ##th ##olo ##gia ##e " . [SEP]
[CLS] carl linnaeus modified that work in 1758 to devi ##se the taxonomic classification system currently in use . [SEP]
[CLS] birds are cat ##ego ##rise ##d as the biological class ave ##s in lin ##nae ##an taxonomy . [SEP]
[CLS] phylogenetic taxonomy places ave ##s in the dinosaur clade the ##rop ##oda . [SEP]
[CLS] ave ##s and a sister group , the order cr ##oco ##di ##lia , contain the only living representatives of the rep ##tile clade arch ##osa ##uria . [SEP]
[CLS] during the late 1990s , ave ##s was most commonly defined phylogenetic ##ally as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x lit ##hog ##raphic ##a " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , an earlier definition proposed by jacques ga ##uth ##ier gained wide currency in the 21st century , and is used by many scientists including adherents of the ph ##yl ##oco ##de system . [SEP]
[CLS] ga ##uth ##ier defined ave ##s to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds . [SEP]
[CLS] this was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils , and assign ##ing them , instead , to the av ##ial ##ae , in part to avoid the uncertain ##ties about the placement of " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x " in relation to animals traditionally thought of as the ##rop ##od dinosaurs . [SEP]
[CLS] ga ##uth ##ier identified four different definitions for the same biological name " ave ##s " , which is a problem . [SEP]
[CLS] ga ##uth ##ier proposed to reserve the term ave ##s only for the crown group consisting of the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants , which corresponds to meaning number 4 below . [SEP]
[CLS] he assigned other names to the other groups . [SEP]
[CLS] under the fourth definition " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x " is an av ##ial ##an , and not a member of ave ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ga ##uth ##ier ' s proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of pal ##ae ##ont ##ology and bird evolution , though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent . [SEP]
[CLS] av ##ial ##ae , initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of ave ##s , is often used synonymous ##ly with the vernacular term " bird " by these researchers . [SEP]
[CLS] most researchers define av ##ial ##ae as branch - based clade , though definitions vary . [SEP]
[CLS] many authors have used a definition similar to " all the ##rop ##ods closer to birds than to " dei ##non ##ych ##us " . " [SEP]
[CLS] av ##ial ##ae is also occasionally defined as an ap ##omo ##rp ##hy - based clade ( that is , one based on physical characteristics ) . [SEP]
[CLS] jacques ga ##uth ##ier , who named av ##ial ##ae in 1986 , re - defined it in 2001 as all dinosaurs that possessed feather ##ed wings used in flap ##ping flight , and the birds that descended from them . [SEP]
[CLS] based on fossil and biological evidence , most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of the ##rop ##od dinosaurs , and more specifically , they are members of mani ##ra ##pt ##ora , a group of the ##rop ##ods which includes dr ##oma ##eo ##sau ##rs and o ##vira ##pt ##ori ##ds , among others . [SEP]
[CLS] as scientists have discovered more the ##rop ##ods closely related to birds , the previously clear distinction between non - birds and birds has become blurred . [SEP]
[CLS] recent discoveries in the lia ##oning province of northeast china , which demonstrate many small the ##rop ##od feather ##ed dinosaurs , contribute to this ambiguity . [SEP]
[CLS] the consensus view in contemporary pal ##ae ##ont ##ology is that the flying the ##rop ##ods , or av ##ial ##ans , are the closest relatives of the dei ##non ##ych ##osa ##urs , which include dr ##oma ##eo ##sau ##rid ##s and tr ##ood ##ont ##ids . [SEP]
[CLS] together , these form a group called para ##ves . [SEP]
[CLS] some basal members of this group , such as " micro ##ra ##pt ##or " , have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly . [SEP]
[CLS] the most basal dei ##non ##ych ##osa ##urs were very small . [SEP]
[CLS] this evidence raises the possibility that the ancestor of all para ##vian ##s may have been arbor ##eal , have been able to glide , or both . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x " and the non - av ##ial ##an feather ##ed dinosaurs , who primarily ate meat , recent studies suggest that the first av ##ial ##ans were om ##ni ##vor ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] the late jurassic " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x " is well known as one of the first transitional fossils to be found , and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x " was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional rep ##ti ##lian characteristics : teeth , clawed fingers , and a long , lizard - like tail , as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not considered a direct ancestor of birds , though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest known av ##ial ##an fossils come from the tia ##oj ##isha ##n formation of china , which has been dated to the late jurassic period ( oxford ##ian stage ) , about 160 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] the av ##ial ##an species from this time period include " an ##chio ##rn ##is hu ##xley ##i " , " xiao ##ting ##ia zheng ##i " , and " au ##ror ##nis xu ##i " . [SEP]
[CLS] the well - known early av ##ial ##an , " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x " , dates from slightly later jurassic rocks ( about 155 million years old ) from germany . [SEP]
[CLS] many of these early av ##ial ##ans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds , but were later lost during bird evolution . [SEP]
[CLS] these features include enlarged claws on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life , and long feathers or " hind wings " covering the hind limbs and feet , which may have been used in aerial maneuver ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] av ##ial ##ans diversified into a wide variety of forms during the cretaceous period . [SEP]
[CLS] many groups retained primitive characteristics , such as clawed wings and teeth , though the latter were lost independently in a number of av ##ial ##an groups , including modern birds ( ave ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] while the earliest forms , such as " arch ##ae ##op ##tery ##x " and " je ##hol ##orn ##is " , retained the long bony tails of their ancestors , the tails of more advanced av ##ial ##ans were shortened with the advent of the p ##y ##gos ##tyle bone in the group p ##y ##gos ##ty ##lia . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late cretaceous , about 100 million years ago , the ancestors of all modern birds evolved a more open pe ##lvis , allowing them to lay larger eggs compared to body size . [SEP]
[CLS] around 95 million years ago , they evolved a better sense of smell . [SEP]
[CLS] the first large , diverse lineage of short - tailed av ##ial ##ans to evolve were the en ##ant ##ior ##ni ##thes , or " opposite birds " , so named because the construction of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds . [SEP]
[CLS] en ##ant ##ior ##ni ##thes occupied a wide array of ecological niche ##s , from sand - probing shore ##birds and fish - eater ##s to tree - dwelling forms and seed - eater ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] while they were the dominant group of av ##ial ##ans during the cretaceous period , en ##ant ##ior ##ni ##thes became extinct along with many other dinosaur groups at the end of the me ##so ##zo ##ic era . [SEP]
[CLS] many species of the second major av ##ial ##an lineage to divers ##ify , the eu ##orn ##ith ##es ( meaning " true birds " , because they include the ancestors of modern birds ) , were semi - aquatic and specialised in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike the en ##ant ##ior ##ni ##thes , which dominated land - based and arbor ##eal habitats , most early eu ##orn ##ith ##es lacked perch ##ing adaptations and seem to have included shore ##bird - like species , wade ##rs , and swimming and diving species . [SEP]
[CLS] the latter included the superficial ##ly gu ##ll - like " ich ##thy ##orn ##is " and the he ##sper ##orn ##ith ##iform ##es , which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic . [SEP]
[CLS] the early eu ##orn ##ith ##es also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds , like strongly keel ##ed breast ##bone ##s , tooth ##less , beak ##ed portions of their jaws ( though most non - av ##ian eu ##orn ##ith ##es retained teeth in other parts of the jaws ) . [SEP]
[CLS] eu ##orn ##ith ##es also included the first av ##ial ##ans to develop true p ##y ##gos ##tyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers , which may have replaced the " hind wing " as the primary mode of aerial maneuver ##ability and braking in flight . [SEP]
[CLS] a study on mosaic evolution in the av ##ian skull found that the last common ancestor of all neo ##rn ##ith ##ines might have had a beak similar to that of the modern hook - billed van ##ga and a skull similar to that of the eurasian golden or ##iol ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] as both species are small aerial and canopy foraging om ##ni ##vor ##es , a similar ecological niche was in ##fer ##red for this hypothetical ancestor . [SEP]
[CLS] all modern birds lie within the crown group ave ##s ( alternately neo ##rn ##ith ##es ) , which has two subdivisions : the pal ##ae ##og ##nath ##ae , which includes the flight ##less rat ##ites ( such as the os ##tric ##hes ) and the weak - flying tina ##mous , and the extremely diverse neo ##gna ##tha ##e , containing all other birds . [SEP]
[CLS] these two subdivisions are often given the rank of super ##ord ##er , although live ##ze ##y and zu ##si assigned them " co ##hort " rank . [SEP]
[CLS] depending on the taxonomic viewpoint , the number of known living bird species varies anywhere from 9 , 800 to 10 , 050 . [SEP]
[CLS] the discovery of " vega ##vis " , a late cretaceous member of the ana ##tidae , proved that the divers ##ification of modern birds started before the ce ##no ##zo ##ic . [SEP]
[CLS] the af ##fin ##ities of an earlier fossil , the possible gall ##iform " austin ##orn ##is lent ##us " , dated to about 85 million years ago , are still too controversial to provide a fossil evidence of modern bird divers ##ification . [SEP]
[CLS] most studies agree on a cretaceous age for the most recent common ancestor of modern birds but estimates range from the middle cretaceous to the latest late cretaceous . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , there is no agreement on whether most of the early divers ##ification of modern birds occurred before or after the cretaceous – pal ##ae ##ogen ##e extinction event . [SEP]
[CLS] this disagreement is in part caused by a diver ##gence in the evidence ; most molecular dating studies suggests a cretaceous radiation , while fossil evidence points to a ce ##no ##zo ##ic radiation ( the so - called ' rocks ' versus ' clocks ' controversy ) . [SEP]
[CLS] previous attempts to reconcile molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial , but more recent estimates , using a more comprehensive sample of fossils and a new way of cal ##ib ##rating molecular clocks , showed that while modern birds originated early in the late cretaceous , a pulse of divers ##ification in all major groups occurred around the cretaceous – pal ##ae ##ogen ##e extinction event .

[CLS] clad ##og ##ram of modern bird relationships based on pr ##um , r . o . " et al " . [SEP]
[CLS] ( 2015 ) with some clade names after yuri , t . et al . ( 2013 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the classification of birds is a contentious issue . [SEP]
[CLS] si ##bley and ahl ##quist ' s " ph ##yl ##ogen ##y and classification of birds " ( 1990 ) is a landmark work on the classification of birds , although it is frequently debated and constantly revised . [SEP]
[CLS] most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate , but scientists disagree about the relationships between the orders themselves ; evidence from modern bird anatomy , fossils and dna have all been brought to bear on the problem , but no strong consensus has emerged . [SEP]
[CLS] more recently , new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders . [SEP]
[CLS] birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven continents , reaching their southern extreme in the snow pet ##rel ' s breeding colonies up to 440 km inland in antarctica . [SEP]
[CLS] the highest bird diversity occurs in tropical regions . [SEP]
[CLS] it was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher spec ##iation rates in the tr ##op ##ics ; however recent studies found higher spec ##iation rates in the high latitude ##s that were offset by greater extinction rates than in the tr ##op ##ics . [SEP]
[CLS] several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world ' s oceans and in them , with some sea ##bird species coming ashore only to breed and some penguins have been recorded diving up to 300 m deep . [SEP]
[CLS] many bird species have established breeding populations in areas to which they have been introduced by humans . [SEP]
[CLS] some of these introductions have been deliberate ; the ring - neck ##ed ph ##ea ##sant , for example , has been introduced around the world as a game bird . [SEP]
[CLS] others have been accidental , such as the establishment of wild monk para ##kee ##ts in several north american cities after their escape from captivity . [SEP]
[CLS] some species , including cattle e ##gre ##t , yellow - headed cara ##car ##a and gala ##h , have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat . [SEP]
[CLS] compared with other ve ##rte ##brates , birds have a body plan that shows many unusual adaptations , mostly to facilitate flight . [SEP]
[CLS] the skeleton consists of very lightweight bones . [SEP]
[CLS] they have large air - filled ca ##vi ##ties ( called p ##ne ##umatic ca ##vi ##ties ) which connect with the respiratory system . [SEP]
[CLS] the skull bones in adults are fused and do not show cr ##anial su ##tures . [SEP]
[CLS] the orbits are large and separated by a bony sept ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] the spine has cervical , thor ##ac ##ic , lu ##mba ##r and ca ##uda ##l regions with the number of cervical ( neck ) vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible , but movement is reduced in the anterior thor ##ac ##ic vertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae . [SEP]
[CLS] the last few are fused with the pe ##lvis to form the syn ##sa ##cr ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] the ribs are flattened and the stern ##um is keel ##ed for the attachment of flight muscles except in the flight ##less bird orders . [SEP]
[CLS] the fore ##lim ##bs are modified into wings . [SEP]
[CLS] the wings are more or less developed depending on the species ; the only known groups that lost their wings are the extinct mo ##a and elephant birds . [SEP]
[CLS] like the reptiles , birds are primarily ur ##ico ##tel ##ic , that is , their kidney ##s extract nitrogen ##ous waste from their blood ##stream and ex ##cre ##te it as ur ##ic acid instead of ur ##ea or ammonia through the ur ##eter ##s into the int ##est ##ine . [SEP]
[CLS] birds do not have a ur ##ina ##ry bladder or external ur ##eth ##ral opening and ( with exception of the os ##tric ##h ) ur ##ic acid is ex ##cre ##ted along with fae ##ces as a semi ##sol ##id waste . [SEP]
[CLS] however , birds such as humming ##birds can be fa ##cu ##lta ##tively am ##mon ##ote ##lic , ex ##cre ##ting most of the nitrogen ##ous waste ##s as ammonia . [SEP]
[CLS] they also ex ##cre ##te cr ##ea ##tine , rather than cr ##ea ##tin ##ine like mammals . [SEP]
[CLS] this material , as well as the output of the int ##est ##ines , emerges from the bird ' s cl ##oa ##ca . [SEP]
[CLS] the cl ##oa ##ca is a multi - purpose opening : waste is expelled through it , most birds mate by joining cl ##oa ##ca , and females lay eggs from it . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , many species of birds reg ##urg ##itate pe ##llet ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] males within pal ##ae ##og ##nath ##ae ( with the exception of the ki ##wi ##s ) , the an ##ser ##iform ##es ( with the exception of scream ##ers ) , and in ru ##diment ##ary forms in gall ##iform ##es ( but fully developed in cr ##ac ##idae ) possess a penis , which is never present in neo ##aves . [SEP]
[CLS] the length is thought to be related to sperm competition . [SEP]
[CLS] when not cop ##ulating , it is hidden within the pro ##ct ##ode ##um compartment within the cl ##oa ##ca , just inside the vent . [SEP]
[CLS] the digest ##ive system of birds is unique , with a crop for storage and a gi ##zza ##rd that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth . [SEP]
[CLS] most birds are highly adapted for rapid digest ##ion to aid with flight . [SEP]
[CLS] some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies , including protein from the int ##est ##ines , as additional energy during migration . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups . [SEP]
[CLS] upon in ##hala ##tion , 75 % of the fresh air bypass ##es the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air . [SEP]
[CLS] the other 25 % of the air goes directly into the lungs . [SEP]
[CLS] when the bird ex ##hale ##s , the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , a bird ' s lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both in ##hala ##tion and ex ##hala ##tion . [SEP]
[CLS] sound production is achieved using the sy ##rin ##x , a muscular chamber incorporating multiple ty ##mp ##ani ##c membranes which diver ##ges from the lower end of the tr ##ache ##a ; the tr ##ache ##a being elongated in some species , increasing the volume of vocal ##isation ##s and the perception of the bird ' s size . [SEP]
[CLS] in birds , the main arteries taking blood away from the heart originate from the right ao ##rti ##c arch ( or ph ##ary ##nge ##al arch ) , unlike in the mammals where the left ao ##rti ##c arch forms this part of the ao ##rta . [SEP]
[CLS] the post ##ca ##va receives blood from the limbs via the renal portal system . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike in mammals , the circulating red blood cells in birds retain their nucleus . [SEP]
[CLS] the av ##ian ci ##rc ##ulator ##y system is driven by a four - chamber ##ed , my ##ogenic heart contained in a fi ##bro ##us per ##ica ##rdial sac . [SEP]
[CLS] this per ##ica ##rdial sac is filled with a ser ##ous fluid for lu ##bri ##cation . [SEP]
[CLS] the heart itself is divided into a right and left half , each with an atrium and vent ##ric ##le . [SEP]
[CLS] the atrium and vent ##ric ##les of each side are separated by at ##rio ##vent ##ric ##ular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction . [SEP]
[CLS] being my ##ogenic , the heart ' s pace is maintained by pace ##maker cells found in the sino ##at ##rial node , located on the right atrium . [SEP]
[CLS] the sino ##at ##rial node uses calcium to cause a de ##pol ##aris ##ing signal trans ##duction pathway from the atrium through right and left at ##rio ##vent ##ric ##ular bundle which communicate ##s contraction to the vent ##ric ##les . [SEP]
[CLS] the av ##ian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers . [SEP]
[CLS] much like a mammalian heart , the av ##ian heart is composed of end ##oca ##rdial , my ##oca ##rdial and epic ##ard ##ial layers . [SEP]
[CLS] the atrium walls tend to be thinner than the vent ##ric ##le walls , due to the intense vent ##ric ##ular contraction used to pump oxygen ##ated blood throughout the body . [SEP]
[CLS] av ##ian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass . [SEP]
[CLS] this adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have a very efficient system for di ##ff ##using oxygen into the blood ; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , birds have more blood in their cap ##illa ##ries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal . [SEP]
[CLS] the arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the vent ##ric ##ular con ##st ##ric ##tion , and become more rigid as they move away from the heart . [SEP]
[CLS] blood moves through the arteries , which undergo va ##so ##con ##st ##ric ##tion , and into arte ##rio ##les which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body . [SEP]
[CLS] as the arte ##rio ##les move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow . [SEP]
[CLS] blood travels through the arte ##rio ##les and moves into the cap ##illa ##ries where gas exchange can occur . [SEP]
[CLS] cap ##illa ##ries are organized into cap ##illa ##ry beds in tissues ; it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste . [SEP]
[CLS] in the cap ##illa ##ry beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues . [SEP]
[CLS] once the blood has become de ##ox ##y ##gen ##ated it travels through ve ##nu ##les then veins and back to the heart . [SEP]
[CLS] veins , unlike arteries , are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] as blood travels through the ve ##nu ##les to the veins a funnel ##ing occurs called va ##so ##di ##lation bringing blood back to the heart . [SEP]
[CLS] once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium , then the right vent ##ric ##le to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen . [SEP]
[CLS] oxygen ##ated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left vent ##ric ##le where it is pumped out to the body . [SEP]
[CLS] the nervous system is large relative to the bird ' s size . [SEP]
[CLS] the most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight - related functions , while the ce ##re ##bell ##um coordinates movement and the ce ##re ##br ##um controls behaviour patterns , navigation , mating and nest building . [SEP]
[CLS] most birds have a poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including ki ##wi ##s , new world vulture ##s and tube ##nos ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] the av ##ian visual system is usually highly developed . [SEP]
[CLS] water birds have special flexible lenses , allowing accommodation for vision in air and water . [SEP]
[CLS] some species also have dual f ##ove ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] birds are te ##tra ##ch ##romatic , possessing ultraviolet ( uv ) sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green , red and blue ones . [SEP]
[CLS] they also have double cones , likely to media ##te ac ##hr ##oma ##tic vision . [SEP]
[CLS] many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye ; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers . [SEP]
[CLS] male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by post ##uring and raising of their nape feathers . [SEP]
[CLS] ultraviolet light is also used in foraging — ke ##strel ##s have been shown to search for prey by detecting the uv reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents . [SEP]
[CLS] with the exception of pigeons and a few other species , the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking . [SEP]
[CLS] instead the eye is lu ##bri ##cated by the nic ##ti ##tat ##ing membrane , a third eye ##lid that moves horizontally . [SEP]
[CLS] the nic ##ti ##tat ##ing membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds . [SEP]
[CLS] the bird re ##tina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pe ##ct ##en . [SEP]
[CLS] most birds cannot move their eyes , although there are exceptions , such as the great co ##rm ##oran ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field , while birds with eyes on the front of their heads , such as owls , have bin ##oc ##ular vision and can estimate the depth of field . [SEP]
[CLS] the av ##ian ear lacks external pin ##nae but is covered by feathers , although in some birds , such as the " as ##io " , " bu ##bo " and " ot ##us " owls , these feathers form tufts which resemble ears . [SEP]
[CLS] the inner ear has a co ##ch ##lea , but it is not spiral as in mammals . [SEP]
[CLS] a few species are able to use chemical defences against predators ; some pro ##cel ##lar ##ii ##form ##es can e ##ject an unpleasant stomach oil against an ag ##gre ##sso ##r , and some species of pit ##oh ##uis from new guinea have a powerful ne ##uro ##to ##xin in their skin and feathers . [SEP]
[CLS] a lack of field observations limit our knowledge , but intra ##sp ##ec ##ific conflicts are known to sometimes result in injury or death . [SEP]
[CLS] the scream ##ers ( an ##him ##idae ) , some ja ##cana ##s ( " ja ##cana " , " hydro ##pha ##sian ##us " ) , the spur - winged goose ( " pl ##ect ##rop ##ter ##us " ) , the torre ##nt duck ( " mer ##gan ##etta " ) and nine species of lap ##wing ( " vane ##llus " ) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon . [SEP]
[CLS] the steamer ducks ( " ta ##chy ##eres " ) , geese and swans ( " an ##ser ##inae " ) , the sol ##itaire ( " pe ##zo ##pha ##ps " ) , sheath ##bill ##s ( " chi ##onis " ) , some gu ##ans ( " cr ##ax " ) and stone curl ##ew ##s ( " bu ##rh ##inus " ) use a bony knob on the al ##ular meta ##car ##pal to punch and hammer opponents . [SEP]
[CLS] the ja ##cana ##s " act ##op ##hil ##orn ##is " and " ir ##ed ##ip ##ar ##ra " have an expanded , blade - like radius . [SEP]
[CLS] the extinct " x ##eni ##ci ##bis " was unique in having an el ##onga ##te fore ##lim ##b and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a joint ##ed club or fl ##ail . [SEP]
[CLS] swans , for instance , may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have two sexes : either female or male . [SEP]
[CLS] the sex of birds is determined by the z and w sex chromosomes , rather than by the x and y chromosomes present in mammals . [SEP]
[CLS] male birds have two z chromosomes ( z ##z ) , and female birds have a w chromosome and a z chromosome ( w ##z ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in nearly all species of birds , an individual ' s sex is determined at fe ##rti ##lis ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] however , one recent study claimed to demonstrate temperature - dependent sex determination among the australian brush ##tur ##key , for which higher temperatures during inc ##uba ##tion resulted in a higher female - to - male sex ratio . [SEP]
[CLS] this , however , was later proven to not be the case . [SEP]
[CLS] these birds do not exhibit temperature - dependent sex determination , but temperature - dependent sex mortality . [SEP]
[CLS] feathers are a feature characteristic of birds ( though also present in some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds ) . [SEP]
[CLS] they facilitate flight , provide insulation that aids in the ##rm ##ore ##gul ##ation , and are used in display , camouflage , and signalling . [SEP]
[CLS] there are several types of feathers , each serving its own set of purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] feathers are ep ##ider ##mal growth ##s attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pt ##ery ##la ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] the distribution pattern of these feather tracts ( pt ##ery ##los ##is ) is used in taxonomy and systematic ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body , called plumage , may vary within species by age , social status , and sex . [SEP]
[CLS] plumage is regularly mo ##ult ##ed ; the standard plumage of a bird that has mo ##ult ##ed after breeding is known as the " non - breeding " plumage , or — in the humphrey - park ##es terminology — " basic " plumage ; breeding plumage ##s or variations of the basic plumage are known under the humphrey - park ##es system as " alternate " plumage ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##ult ##ing is annual in most species , although some may have two mo ##ult ##s a year , and large birds of prey may mo ##ult only once every few years . [SEP]
[CLS] mo ##ult ##ing patterns vary across species . [SEP]
[CLS] in pass ##erine ##s , flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the inner ##most primary being the first . [SEP]
[CLS] when the fifth of sixth primary is replaced , the outer ##most ter ##tia ##ries begin to drop . [SEP]
[CLS] after the inner ##most ter ##tia ##ries are mo ##ult ##ed , the second ##aries starting from the inner ##most begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers ( cent ##ri ##fu ##gal mo ##ult ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the greater primary covert ##s are mo ##ult ##ed in sync ##hr ##ony with the primary that they overlap . [SEP]
[CLS] a small number of species , such as ducks and geese , lose all of their flight feathers at once , temporarily becoming flight ##less . [SEP]
[CLS] as a general rule , the tail feathers are mo ##ult ##ed and replaced starting with the inner ##most pair . [SEP]
[CLS] cent ##rip ##eta ##l mo ##ult ##s of tail feathers are however seen in the ph ##asian ##idae . [SEP]
[CLS] the cent ##ri ##fu ##gal mo ##ult is modified in the tail feathers of wood ##pe ##cker ##s and tree ##cre ##ep ##ers , in that it begins with the second inner ##most pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail . [SEP]
[CLS] the general pattern seen in pass ##erine ##s is that the primaries are replaced outward , second ##aries inward , and the tail from centre outward . [SEP]
[CLS] before nesting , the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly . [SEP]
[CLS] the skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in inc ##uba ##tion . [SEP]
[CLS] feathers require maintenance and birds pre ##en or groom them daily , spending an average of around 9 % of their daily time on this . [SEP]
[CLS] the bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply wax ##y secret ##ions from the ur ##op ##y ##gia ##l gland ; these secret ##ions protect the feathers ' flexibility and act as an anti ##mic ##ro ##bial agent , inhibit ##ing the growth of feather - de ##grad ##ing bacteria . [SEP]
[CLS] this may be supplemented with the secret ##ions of form ##ic acid from ants , which birds receive through a behaviour known as anti ##ng , to remove feather parasites . [SEP]
[CLS] the scales of birds are composed of the same ke ##rat ##in as beak ##s , claws , and spurs . [SEP]
[CLS] they are found mainly on the toes and meta ##tar ##sus , but may be found further up on the ankle in some birds . [SEP]
[CLS] most bird scales do not overlap significantly , except in the cases of king ##fish ##ers and wood ##pe ##cker ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the scales of birds are thought to be homo ##log ##ous to those of reptiles and mammals . [SEP]
[CLS] most birds can fly , which distinguishes them from almost all other ve ##rte ##brate classes . [SEP]
[CLS] flight is the primary means of loco ##mot ##ion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have various adaptations for flight , including a lightweight skeleton , two large flight muscles , the pe ##ctor ##alis ( which accounts for 15 % of the total mass of the bird ) and the su ##pr ##aco ##rac ##oid ##eus , as well as a modified fore ##lim ##b ( wing ) that serves as an aero ##foil . [SEP]
[CLS] wing shape and size generally determine a bird ' s flight style and performance ; many birds combine powered , flap ##ping flight with less energy - intensive soaring flight . [SEP]
[CLS] about 60 extant bird species are flight ##less , as were many extinct birds . [SEP]
[CLS] flight ##lessness often arises in birds on isolated islands , probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators . [SEP]
[CLS] although flight ##less , penguins use similar mu ##scu ##lat ##ure and movements to " fly " through the water , as do au ##ks , shear ##water ##s and dip ##pers . [SEP]
[CLS] most birds are di ##urn ##al , but some birds , such as many species of owls and night ##jar ##s , are nocturnal or cr ##ep ##us ##cular ( active during twilight hours ) , and many coastal wade ##rs feed when the tides are appropriate , by day or night . [SEP]
[CLS] birds ' diet ##s are varied and often include nectar , fruit , plants , seeds , carr ##ion , and various small animals , including other birds . [SEP]
[CLS] because birds have no teeth , their digest ##ive system is adapted to process un ##mas ##tica ##ted food items that are swallowed whole . [SEP]
[CLS] birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called general ##ists , while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists . [SEP]
[CLS] birds ' feeding strategies vary by species . [SEP]
[CLS] many birds g ##lean for insects , invertebrates , fruit , or seeds . [SEP]
[CLS] some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch . [SEP]
[CLS] those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial ' biological control agents ' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programmes . [SEP]
[CLS] combined , insect ##ivo ##rous birds eat 400 – 500 million metric tons of art ##hr ##op ##ods annually . [SEP]
[CLS] nectar feeder ##s such as humming ##birds , sun ##birds , lori ##es , and lori ##kee ##ts amongst others have specially adapted brush ##y tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co - adapted flowers . [SEP]
[CLS] ki ##wi ##s and shore ##birds with long bills probe for invertebrates ; shore ##birds ' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niche ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] lo ##ons , diving ducks , penguins and au ##ks pursue their prey underwater , using their wings or feet for propulsion , while aerial predators such as sul ##ids , king ##fish ##ers and ter ##ns plunge dive after their prey . [SEP]
[CLS] flaming ##os , three species of pri ##on , and some ducks are filter feeder ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] geese and da ##bbling ducks are primarily graz ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] some species , including frigate ##birds , gu ##lls , and sk ##ua ##s , engage in k ##le ##pt ##opa ##ras ##itis ##m , stealing food items from other birds . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##le ##pt ##opa ##ras ##itis ##m is thought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting , rather than a significant part of any species ' diet ; a study of great frigate ##birds stealing from masked boo ##bies estimated that the frigate ##birds stole at most 40 % of their food and on average stole only 5 % . [SEP]
[CLS] other birds are sc ##ave ##nger ##s ; some of these , like vulture ##s , are specialised carr ##ion eater ##s , while others , like gu ##lls , co ##r ##vid ##s , or other birds of prey , are op ##port ##uni ##sts . [SEP]
[CLS] water is needed by many birds although their mode of ex ##cre ##tion and lack of sweat glands reduces the physiological demands . [SEP]
[CLS] some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food . [SEP]
[CLS] they may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise , saving on moisture loss from eva ##por ##ative cooling or panting . [SEP]
[CLS] sea ##birds can drink sea ##water and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils . [SEP]
[CLS] most birds scoop water in their beak ##s and raise their head to let water run down the throat . [SEP]
[CLS] some species , especially of arid zones , belonging to the pigeon , finch , mouse ##bird , button - qu ##ail and bust ##ard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads . [SEP]
[CLS] some desert birds depend on water sources and sand ##gr ##ouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at water ##holes . [SEP]
[CLS] nesting sand ##gr ##ouse and many pl ##overs carry water to their young by wet ##ting their belly feathers . [SEP]
[CLS] some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or reg ##urg ##itate it along with food . [SEP]
[CLS] the pigeon family , flaming ##os and penguins have adaptations to produce a nut ##rit ##ive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks . [SEP]
[CLS] feathers being critical to the survival of a bird , require maintenance . [SEP]
[CLS] apart from physical wear and tear , feathers face the onslaught of fungi , ec ##top ##ara ##sit ##ic feather mit ##es and bird ##lice . [SEP]
[CLS] the physical condition of feathers are maintained by pre ##ening often with the application of secret ##ions from the pre ##en gland . [SEP]
[CLS] birds also bath ##e in water or dust themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] while some birds dip into shallow water , more aerial species may make aerial dip ##s into water and arbor ##eal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves . [SEP]
[CLS] birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust - bath ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] a behaviour termed as anti ##ng in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ec ##top ##ara ##sit ##e load in feathers . [SEP]
[CLS] many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ec ##top ##ara ##sit ##ic activity that may lead to feather damage . [SEP]
[CLS] many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of seasonal temperatures , therefore opt ##imi ##sing availability of food sources and breeding habitat . [SEP]
[CLS] these migration ##s vary among the different groups . [SEP]
[CLS] many land ##birds , shore ##birds , and water ##birds undertake annual long distance migration ##s , usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] these birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non - breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere . [SEP]
[CLS] before migration , birds substantially increase body fat ##s and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs . [SEP]
[CLS] migration is highly demanding energetic ##ally , particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without ref ##uel ##ling . [SEP]
[CLS] land ##birds have a flight range of around 2500 km and shore ##birds can fly up to 4000 km , although the bar - tailed god ##wi ##t is capable of non - stop flights of up to 102 ##00 km . [SEP]
[CLS] sea ##birds also undertake long migration ##s , the longest annual migration being those of soo ##ty shear ##water ##s , which nest in new zealand and chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the north pacific off japan , alaska and california , an annual round trip of 640 ##00 km . [SEP]
[CLS] other sea ##birds disperse after breeding , travelling widely but having no set migration route . [SEP]
[CLS] alba ##tro ##sse ##s nesting in the southern ocean often undertake ci ##rc ##ump ##olar trips between breeding seasons . [SEP]
[CLS] some bird species undertake shorter migration ##s , travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food . [SEP]
[CLS] ir ##rup ##tive species such as the bore ##al finch ##es are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next . [SEP]
[CLS] this type of migration is normally associated with food availability . [SEP]
[CLS] species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range , with individuals from higher latitude ##s travelling into the existing range of con ##sp ##ec ##ific ##s ; others undertake partial migration ##s , where only a fraction of the population , usually females and sub ##dom ##ina ##nt males , migrate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions ; in australia , surveys found that 44 % of non - pass ##erine birds and 32 % of pass ##erine ##s were partially migratory . [SEP]
[CLS] alt ##it ##udi ##nal migration is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during sub ##op ##ti ##mal conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] it is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become in ##hos ##pit ##able due to lack of food . [SEP]
[CLS] some species may also be nomadic , holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability . [SEP]
[CLS] parrot ##s as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor se ##dent ##ary but considered to either be di ##sper ##sive , ir ##rup ##tive , nomadic or undertake small and irregular migration ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time ; in an experiment conducted in the 1950s , a man ##x shear ##water released in boston in the united states returned to its colony in sk ##ome ##r , in wales within 13 days , a distance of 51 ##50 km . [SEP]
[CLS] birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods . [SEP]
[CLS] for di ##urn ##al migrants , the sun is used to navigate by day , and a stellar compass is used at night . [SEP]
[CLS] birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock . [SEP]
[CLS] orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellation ##s surrounding polar ##is . [SEP]
[CLS] these are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the earth ' s geo ##ma ##gne ##tism through specialised photo ##re ##ce ##pt ##ors . [SEP]
[CLS] birds communicate using primarily visual and auditory signals . [SEP]
[CLS] signals can be inter ##sp ##ec ##ific ( between species ) and intra ##sp ##ec ##ific ( within species ) . [SEP]
[CLS] birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance , to display breeding condition in sexually selected species , or to make threatening displays , as in the sun ##bit ##tern ' s mimic ##ry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks . [SEP]
[CLS] variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds , particularly between species . [SEP]
[CLS] visual communication among birds may also involve ritual ##ised displays , which have developed from non - signalling actions such as pre ##ening , the adjustments of feather position , peck ##ing , or other behaviour . [SEP]
[CLS] these displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair - bonds . [SEP]
[CLS] the most elaborate displays occur during courtship , where " dances " are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements ; males ' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays . [SEP]
[CLS] bird calls and songs , which are produced in the sy ##rin ##x , are the major means by which birds communicate with sound . [SEP]
[CLS] this communication can be very complex ; some species can operate the two sides of the sy ##rin ##x independently , allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs . [SEP]
[CLS] calls are used for a variety of purposes , including mate attraction , evaluation of potential mates , bond formation , the claiming and maintenance of territories , the identification of other individuals ( such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season ) , and the warning of other birds of potential predators , sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat . [SEP]
[CLS] some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication . [SEP]
[CLS] the " coe ##no ##cor ##yp ##ha " s ##ni ##pes of new zealand drive air through their feathers , wood ##pe ##cker ##s drum for long distance communication , and palm cock ##ato ##os use tools to drum . [SEP]
[CLS] while some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups , other birds may form large flock ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the principal benefits of flock ##ing are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency . [SEP]
[CLS] defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests , where ambush pre ##dation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system . [SEP]
[CLS] this has led to the development of many mixed - species feeding flock ##s , which are usually composed of small numbers of many species ; these flock ##s provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources . [SEP]
[CLS] costs of flock ##ing include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases . [SEP]
[CLS] birds sometimes also form associations with non - av ##ian species . [SEP]
[CLS] plunge - diving sea ##birds associate with dolphins and tuna , which push sho ##aling fish towards the surface . [SEP]
[CLS] horn ##bill ##s have a mutual ##istic relationship with dwarf mon ##go ##oses , in which they for ##age together and warn each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators . [SEP]
[CLS] the high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times . [SEP]
[CLS] sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vi ##gil ##ant sleep , where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye - opening " peek ##s " , allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats . [SEP]
[CLS] swift ##s are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their ro ##ost ##ing flight . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight . [SEP]
[CLS] some birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into slow - wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time . [SEP]
[CLS] the birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock . [SEP]
[CLS] this may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vi ##gil ##ant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock . [SEP]
[CLS] this adaptation is also known from marine mammals . [SEP]
[CLS] communal ro ##ost ##ing is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators . [SEP]
[CLS] ro ##ost ##ing sites are often chosen with regard to the ##rm ##ore ##gul ##ation and safety . [SEP]
[CLS] many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their bills in their back feathers , although others place their beak ##s among their breast feathers . [SEP]
[CLS] many birds rest on one leg , while some may pull up their legs into their feathers , especially in cold weather . [SEP]
[CLS] perch ##ing birds have a tend ##on locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep . [SEP]
[CLS] many ground birds , such as qu ##ail ##s and ph ##ea ##sant ##s , ro ##ost in trees . [SEP]
[CLS] a few parrot ##s of the genus " lori ##culus " ro ##ost hanging upside down . [SEP]
[CLS] some humming ##birds go into a nightly state of tor ##por accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates . [SEP]
[CLS] this physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species , including owl ##et - night ##jar ##s , night ##jar ##s , and woods ##wall ##ows . [SEP]
[CLS] one species , the common poor ##wil ##l , even enters a state of hi ##ber ##nation . [SEP]
[CLS] birds do not have sweat glands , but they may cool themselves by moving to shade , standing in water , panting , increasing their surface area , fluttering their throat or by using special behaviour ##s like ur ##oh ##id ##rosis to cool themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] ninety - five per cent of bird species are socially mono ##gam ##ous . [SEP]
[CLS] these species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or — in some cases — for several years or until the death of one mate . [SEP]
[CLS] mono ##gam ##y allows for both paternal care and bi ##par ##ental care , which is especially important for species in which females require males ' assistance for successful brood - rear ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] among many socially mono ##gam ##ous species , extra - pair cop ##ulation ( in ##fide ##lity ) is common . [SEP]
[CLS] such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males , but may also be the result of forced cop ##ulation in ducks and other ana ##ti ##ds . [SEP]
[CLS] female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after cop ##ulation , a hundred days in some species . [SEP]
[CLS] sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism . [SEP]
[CLS] for females , possible benefits of extra - pair cop ##ulation include getting better genes for her offspring and ins ##uring against the possibility of in ##fer ##tility in her mate . [SEP]
[CLS] males of species that engage in extra - pair cop ##ulation ##s will closely guard their mates to ensure the parent ##age of the offspring that they raise . [SEP]
[CLS] other mating systems , including poly ##gy ##ny , poly ##and ##ry , poly ##gam ##y , poly ##gy ##nan ##dry , and prom ##is ##cuit ##y , also occur . [SEP]
[CLS] poly ##gam ##ous breeding systems arise when females are able to raise brood ##s without the help of males . [SEP]
[CLS] some species may use more than one system depending on the circumstances . [SEP]
[CLS] breeding usually involves some form of courtship display , typically performed by the male . [SEP]
[CLS] most displays are rather simple and involve some type of song . [SEP]
[CLS] some displays , however , are quite elaborate . [SEP]
[CLS] depending on the species , these may include wing or tail drumming , dancing , aerial flights , or communal le ##kki ##ng . [SEP]
[CLS] females are generally the ones that drive partner selection , although in the poly ##and ##rous ph ##ala ##rop ##es , this is reversed : plain ##er males choose brightly coloured females . [SEP]
[CLS] courtship feeding , billing and all ##op ##reen ##ing are commonly performed between partners , generally after the birds have paired and mated . [SEP]
[CLS] homosexual behaviour has been observed in males or females in numerous species of birds , including cop ##ulation , pair - bonding , and joint parenting of chicks . [SEP]
[CLS] many birds actively defend a territory from others of the same species during the breeding season ; maintenance of territories protects the food source for their chicks . [SEP]
[CLS] species that are unable to defend feeding territories , such as sea ##birds and swift ##s , often breed in colonies instead ; this is thought to offer protection from predators . [SEP]
[CLS] colonial breeders defend small nesting sites , and competition between and within species for nesting sites can be intense . [SEP]
[CLS] all birds lay am ##nio ##tic eggs with hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate . [SEP]
[CLS] hole and burr ##ow nesting species tend to lay white or pale eggs , while open nest ##ers lay camouflage ##d eggs . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many exceptions to this pattern , however ; the ground - nesting night ##jar ##s have pale eggs , and camouflage is instead provided by their plumage . [SEP]
[CLS] species that are victims of brood parasites have varying egg colours to improve the chances of spotting a parasite ' s egg , which forces female parasites to match their eggs to those of their hosts . [SEP]
[CLS] bird eggs are usually laid in a nest . [SEP]
[CLS] most species create somewhat elaborate nests , which can be cups , domes , plates , beds scrape ##s , mounds , or burrows . [SEP]
[CLS] some bird nests , however , are extremely primitive ; alba ##tro ##ss nests are no more than a scrape on the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] most birds build nests in sheltered , hidden areas to avoid pre ##dation , but large or colonial birds — which are more capable of defence — may build more open nests . [SEP]
[CLS] during nest construction , some species seek out plant matter from plants with parasite - reducing toxin ##s to improve chick survival , and feathers are often used for nest insulation . [SEP]
[CLS] some bird species have no nests ; the cliff - nesting common gui ##lle ##mot lays its eggs on bare rock , and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet . [SEP]
[CLS] the absence of nests is especially prevalent in ground - nesting species where the newly hatch ##ed young are pre ##co ##cial . [SEP]
[CLS] inc ##uba ##tion , which opt ##imi ##ses temperature for chick development , usually begins after the last egg has been laid . [SEP]
[CLS] in mono ##gam ##ous species inc ##uba ##tion duties are often shared , whereas in poly ##gam ##ous species one parent is wholly responsible for inc ##uba ##tion . [SEP]
[CLS] warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches , areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the inc ##uba ##ting birds . [SEP]
[CLS] inc ##uba ##tion can be an energetic ##ally demanding process ; adult alba ##tro ##sse ##s , for instance , lose as much as 83 g of body weight per day of inc ##uba ##tion . [SEP]
[CLS] the warmth for the inc ##uba ##tion of the eggs of mega ##pod ##es comes from the sun , decay ##ing vegetation or volcanic sources . [SEP]
[CLS] inc ##uba ##tion periods range from 10 days ( in wood ##pe ##cker ##s , cuckoo ##s and pass ##erine birds ) to over 80 days ( in alba ##tro ##sse ##s and ki ##wi ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the diversity of characteristics of birds is great , sometimes even in closely related species . [SEP]
[CLS] several av ##ian characteristics are compared in the table below . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time of their hatch ##ing , chicks range in development from helpless to independent , depending on their species . [SEP]
[CLS] helpless chicks are termed " alt ##ric ##ial " , and tend to be born small , blind , im ##mobile and naked ; chicks that are mobile and feather ##ed upon hatch ##ing are termed " pre ##co ##cial " . [SEP]
[CLS] alt ##ric ##ial chicks need help the ##rm ##ore ##gul ##ating and must be brood ##ed for longer than pre ##co ##cial chicks . [SEP]
[CLS] the young of many bird species do not precisely fit into either the pre ##co ##cial or alt ##ric ##ial category , having some aspects of each and thus fall somewhere on an " alt ##ric ##ial - pre ##co ##cial spectrum " . [SEP]
[CLS] chicks at neither extreme but favor ##ing one or the other may be termed semi - pre ##co ##cial or semi - alt ##ric ##ial . [SEP]
[CLS] the length and nature of parental care varies widely amongst different orders and species . [SEP]
[CLS] at one extreme , parental care in mega ##pod ##es ends at hatch ##ing ; the newly hatch ##ed chick dig ##s itself out of the nest mound without parental assistance and can fen ##d for itself immediately . [SEP]
[CLS] at the other extreme , many sea ##birds have extended periods of parental care , the longest being that of the great frigate ##bird , whose chicks take up to six months to fled ##ge and are fed by the parents for up to an additional 14 months . [SEP]
[CLS] the " chick guard stage " describes the period of breeding during which one of the adult birds is permanently present at the nest after chicks have hatch ##ed . [SEP]
[CLS] the main purpose of the guard stage is to aid offspring to the ##rm ##ore ##gul ##ate and protect them from pre ##dation . [SEP]
[CLS] in some species , both parents care for nest ##lings and fledgling ##s ; in others , such care is the responsibility of only one sex . [SEP]
[CLS] in some species , other members of the same species — usually close relatives of the breeding pair , such as offspring from previous brood ##s — will help with the raising of the young . [SEP]
[CLS] such all ##opa ##rent ##ing is particularly common among the co ##r ##vid ##a , which includes such birds as the true crows , australian mag ##pie and fairy - wren ##s , but has been observed in species as different as the rifle ##man and red kite . [SEP]
[CLS] among most groups of animals , male parental care is rare . [SEP]
[CLS] in birds , however , it is quite common — more so than in any other ve ##rte ##brate class . [SEP]
[CLS] although territory and nest site defence , inc ##uba ##tion , and chick feeding are often shared tasks , there is sometimes a division of labour in which one mate undertake ##s all or most of a particular duty . [SEP]
[CLS] the point at which chicks fled ##ge varies dramatically . [SEP]
[CLS] the chicks of the " synth ##lib ##ora ##mp ##hus " mu ##rre ##lets , like the ancient mu ##rre ##let , leave the nest the night after they hatch , following their parents out to sea , where they are raised away from terrestrial predators . [SEP]
[CLS] some other species , such as ducks , move their chicks away from the nest at an early age . [SEP]
[CLS] in most species , chicks leave the nest just before , or soon after , they are able to fly . [SEP]
[CLS] the amount of parental care after fled ##ging varies ; alba ##tro ##ss chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help , while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fled ##ging . [SEP]
[CLS] chicks may also follow their parents during their first migration . [SEP]
[CLS] brood para ##sit ##ism , in which an egg - layer leaves her eggs with another individual ' s brood , is more common among birds than any other type of organism . [SEP]
[CLS] after a parasitic bird lays her eggs in another bird ' s nest , they are often accepted and raised by the host at the expense of the host ' s own brood . [SEP]
[CLS] brood parasites may be either " ob ##liga ##te brood parasites " , which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young , or " non - ob ##liga ##te brood parasites " , which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of con ##sp ##ec ##ific ##s to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young . [SEP]
[CLS] one hundred bird species , including honey ##guide ##s , ict ##eri ##ds , and ducks , are ob ##liga ##te parasites , though the most famous are the cuckoo ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host ' s young , which allows them to destroy the host ' s eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host ' s chicks ; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have evolved a variety of mating behaviour ##s , with the peacock tail being perhaps the most famous example of sexual selection and the fisher ##ian runaway . [SEP]
[CLS] commonly occurring sexual dim ##or ##phi ##sms such as size and colour differences are energetic ##ally costly attributes that signal competitive breeding situations . [SEP]
[CLS] many types of av ##ian sexual selection have been identified ; inter ##se ##x ##ual selection , also known as female choice ; and intra ##se ##x ##ual competition , where individuals of the more abundant sex compete with each other for the privilege to mate . [SEP]
[CLS] sexually selected traits often evolve to become more pronounced in competitive breeding situations until the trait begins to limit the individual ' s fitness . [SEP]
[CLS] conflicts between an individual fitness and signalling adaptations ensure that sexually selected ornaments such as plumage coloration and courtship behaviour are " honest " traits . [SEP]
[CLS] signals must be costly to ensure that only good - quality individuals can present these exaggerated sexual ornaments and behaviour ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in ##bre ##eding causes early death ( in ##bre ##eding depression ) in the zebra finch " tae ##nio ##py ##gia gut ##tat ##a " . [SEP]
[CLS] embryo survival ( that is , hatch ##ing success of fertile eggs ) was significantly lower for si ##b - si ##b mating pairs than for unrelated pairs . [SEP]
[CLS] darwin ' s finch " geo ##sp ##iza scan ##den ##s " experiences in ##bre ##eding depression ( reduced survival of offspring ) and the magnitude of this effect is influenced by environmental conditions such as low food availability . [SEP]
[CLS] inc ##est ##uous mating ##s by the purple - crowned fairy wren " mal ##urus corona ##tus " result in severe fitness costs due to in ##bre ##eding depression ( greater than 30 % reduction in hatch ##ability of eggs ) . [SEP]
[CLS] females paired with related males may undertake extra pair mating ##s ( see prom ##is ##cuit ##y # other animals for 90 % frequency in av ##ian species ) that can reduce the negative effects of in ##bre ##eding . [SEP]
[CLS] however , there are ecological and demographic constraints on extra pair mating ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , 43 % of brood ##s produced by inc ##est ##uously paired females contained extra pair young . [SEP]
[CLS] in ##bre ##eding depression occurs in the great ti ##t ( " par ##us major " ) when the offspring produced as a result of a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness . [SEP]
[CLS] in natural populations of " par ##us major " , in ##bre ##eding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace , which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative . [SEP]
[CLS] southern pie ##d ba ##bble ##rs " tu ##rdo ##ides bi ##color " appear to avoid in ##bre ##eding in two ways . [SEP]
[CLS] the first is through dispersal , and the second is by avoiding familiar group members as mates . [SEP]
[CLS] although both males and females disperse locally , they move outside the range where genetically related individuals are likely to be encountered . [SEP]
[CLS] within their group , individuals only acquire breeding positions when the opposite - sex breed ##er is unrelated . [SEP]
[CLS] cooperative breeding in birds typically occurs when offspring , usually males , delay dispersal from their natal group in order to remain with the family to help rear younger kin . [SEP]
[CLS] female offspring rarely stay at home , di ##sper ##sing over distances that allow them to breed independently , or to join unrelated groups . [SEP]
[CLS] in general , in ##bre ##eding is avoided because it leads to a reduction in pro ##geny fitness ( in ##bre ##eding depression ) due largely to the homo ##zy ##go ##us expression of del ##eter ##ious recess ##ive all ##eles . [SEP]
[CLS] cross - fe ##rti ##lis ##ation between unrelated individuals or ##dina ##rily leads to the mask ##ing of del ##eter ##ious recess ##ive all ##eles in pro ##geny . [SEP]
[CLS] birds occupy a wide range of ecological positions . [SEP]
[CLS] while some birds are general ##ists , others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements . [SEP]
[CLS] even within a single habitat , such as a forest , the niche ##s occupied by different species of birds vary , with some species feeding in the forest canopy , others beneath the canopy , and still others on the forest floor . [SEP]
[CLS] forest birds may be insect ##ivo ##res , fr ##ug ##ivo ##res , and nectar ##ivo ##res . [SEP]
[CLS] aquatic birds generally feed by fishing , plant eating , and piracy or k ##le ##pt ##opa ##ras ##itis ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] birds of prey special ##ise in hunting mammals or other birds , while vulture ##s are specialised sc ##ave ##nger ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] aviv ##ores are animals that are specialised at prey ##ing on birds . [SEP]
[CLS] some nectar - feeding birds are important poll ##inator ##s , and many fr ##ug ##ivo ##res play a key role in seed dispersal . [SEP]
[CLS] plants and poll ##inating birds often coe ##vo ##l ##ve , and in some cases a flower ' s primary poll ##inator is the only species capable of reaching its nectar . [SEP]
[CLS] birds are often important to island ecology . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not ; on those islands , birds may fu ##lf ##il ecological roles typically played by larger animals . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in new zealand the mo ##as were important browser ##s , as are the ke ##rer ##u and ko ##ka ##ko today . [SEP]
[CLS] today the plants of new zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct mo ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] nesting sea ##birds may also affect the ecology of islands and surrounding seas , principally through the concentration of large quantities of gu ##ano , which may en ##rich the local soil and the surrounding seas . [SEP]
[CLS] a wide variety of av ##ian ecology field methods , including counts , nest monitoring , and capturing and marking , are used for researching av ##ian ecology . [SEP]
[CLS] since birds are highly visible and common animals , humans have had a relationship with them since the dawn of man . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes , these relationships are mutual ##istic , like the cooperative honey - gathering among honey ##guide ##s and african peoples such as the bo ##rana . [SEP]
[CLS] other times , they may be com ##men ##sal , as when species such as the house sparrow have benefited from human activities . [SEP]
[CLS] several bird species have become commercially significant agricultural pest ##s , and some pose an aviation hazard . [SEP]
[CLS] human activities can also be detrimental , and have threatened numerous bird species with extinction ( hunting , av ##ian lead poisoning , pest ##icides , road ##kill , wind turbine kills and pre ##dation by pet cats and dogs are common sources of death for birds ) . [SEP]
[CLS] birds can act as vectors for spreading diseases such as psi ##tta ##cos ##is , salmon ##ello ##sis , camp ##yl ##ob ##act ##eri ##osis , my ##co ##ba ##cter ##ios ##is ( av ##ian tuberculosis ) , av ##ian influenza ( bird flu ) , gia ##rdi ##asi ##s , and crypt ##os ##por ##idi ##osis over long distances . [SEP]
[CLS] some of these are zoo ##not ##ic diseases that can also be transmitted to humans . [SEP]
[CLS] domestic ##ated birds raised for meat and eggs , called poultry , are the largest source of animal protein eaten by humans ; in 2003 , 76 million tons of poultry and 61 million tons of eggs were produced worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] chickens account for much of human poultry consumption , though domestic ##ated turkey ##s , ducks , and geese are also relatively common . [SEP]
[CLS] many species of birds are also hunted for meat . [SEP]
[CLS] bird hunting is primarily a recreational activity except in extremely undeveloped areas . [SEP]
[CLS] the most important birds hunted in north and south america are water ##fo ##wl ; other widely hunted birds include ph ##ea ##sant ##s , wild turkey ##s , qu ##ail , dove ##s , partridge , gr ##ouse , s ##ni ##pe , and wood ##cock . [SEP]
[CLS] mu ##tton ##bird ##ing is also popular in australia and new zealand . [SEP]
[CLS] although some hunting , such as that of mu ##tton ##birds , may be sustainable , hunting has led to the extinction or end ##anger ##ment of dozens of species . [SEP]
[CLS] other commercially valuable products from birds include feathers ( especially the down of geese and ducks ) , which are used as insulation in clothing and bed ##ding , and sea ##bird fae ##ces ( gu ##ano ) , which is a valuable source of phosphorus and nitrogen . [SEP]
[CLS] the war of the pacific , sometimes called the gu ##ano war , was fought in part over the control of gu ##ano deposits . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have been domestic ##ated by humans both as pets and for practical purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] colourful birds , such as parrot ##s and my ##nas , are bred in captivity or kept as pets , a practice that has led to the illegal trafficking of some endangered species . [SEP]
[CLS] falcons and co ##rm ##oran ##ts have long been used for hunting and fishing , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] messenger pigeons , used since at least 1 ad , remained important as recently as world war ii . [SEP]
[CLS] today , such activities are more common either as ho ##bbies , for entertainment and tourism , or for sports such as pigeon racing . [SEP]
[CLS] amateur bird enthusiasts ( called bird ##watch ##ers , twitch ##ers or , more commonly , bird ##ers ) number in the millions . [SEP]
[CLS] many home ##own ##ers erect bird feeder ##s near their homes to attract various species . [SEP]
[CLS] bird feeding has grown into a multi ##mill ##ion - dollar industry ; for example , an estimated 75 % of households in britain provide food for birds at some point during the winter . [SEP]
[CLS] birds play prominent and diverse roles in religion and mythology . [SEP]
[CLS] in religion , birds may serve as either messengers or priests and leaders for a deity , such as in the cult of make ##ma ##ke , in which the tang ##ata man ##u of easter island served as chiefs or as attendants , as in the case of hug ##in and mu ##nin , the two common ravens who whispered news into the ears of the norse god odin . [SEP]
[CLS] in several civil ##isation ##s of ancient italy , particularly et ##rus ##can and roman religion , priests were involved in aug ##ury , or interpreting the words of birds while the " aus ##pe ##x " ( from which the word " aus ##pic ##ious " is derived ) watched their activities to fore ##tell events . [SEP]
[CLS] they may also serve as religious symbols , as when jonah ( hebrew : י ##ו ##נ ##ה , dove ) embodied the fright , pass ##ivity , mourning , and beauty traditionally associated with dove ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have themselves been dei ##fied , as in the case of the common peacock , which is perceived as mother earth by the dr ##avi ##dian ##s of india . [SEP]
[CLS] in the ancient world , dove ##s were used as symbols of the mesopotamia ##n goddess ina ##nna ( later known as is ##hta ##r ) , the can ##aan ##ite mother goddess asher ##ah , and the greek goddess ap ##hr ##od ##ite . [SEP]
[CLS] in ancient greece , athena , the goddess of wisdom and patron deity of the city of athens , had a little owl as her symbol . [SEP]
[CLS] in religious images preserved from the inca and ti ##wana ##ku empires , birds are depicted in the process of trans ##gre ##ssing boundaries between earthly and underground spiritual realms . [SEP]
[CLS] indigenous peoples of the central andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds . [SEP]
[CLS] birds have featured in culture and art since prehistoric times , when they were represented in early cave paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] some birds have been perceived as monsters , including the mythological roc and the maori ' s legendary " po ##ua ##kai " , a giant bird capable of snatch ##ing humans . [SEP]
[CLS] birds were later used as symbols of power , as in the magnificent peacock throne of the mughal and persian emperors . [SEP]
[CLS] with the advent of scientific interest in birds , many paintings of birds were commissioned for books . [SEP]
[CLS] among the most famous of these bird artists was john james au ##du ##bon , whose paintings of north american birds were a great commercial success in europe and who later lent his name to the national au ##du ##bon society . [SEP]
[CLS] birds are also important figures in poetry ; for example , homer incorporated nightingale ##s into his " odyssey " , and cat ##ull ##us used a sparrow as an erotic symbol in his cat ##ull ##us 2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the relationship between an alba ##tro ##ss and a sailor is the central theme of samuel taylor cole ##ridge ' s " the rim ##e of the ancient marine ##r " , which led to the use of the term as a metaphor for a ' burden ' . [SEP]
[CLS] other english metaphor ##s derive from birds ; vulture funds and vulture investors , for instance , take their name from the sc ##ave ##nging vulture . [SEP]
[CLS] perceptions of bird species vary across cultures . [SEP]
[CLS] owls are associated with bad luck , witchcraft , and death in parts of africa , but are regarded as wise across much of europe . [SEP]
[CLS] hoop ##oes were considered sacred in ancient egypt and symbols of virtue in persia , but were thought of as thieves across much of europe and ha ##rbin ##gers of war in scandinavia . [SEP]
[CLS] in herald ##ry , birds , especially eagles , often appear in coats of arms . [SEP]
[CLS] in music , birds ##ong has influenced composers and musicians in several ways : they can be inspired by birds ##ong ; they can intentionally im ##itate bird song in a composition , as viva ##ld ##i , mess ##iae ##n , and beethoven did , along with many later composers ; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works , as otto ##rino res ##pi ##ghi first did ; or like beatrice harrison and david roth ##enberg , they can duet with birds . [SEP]
[CLS] although human activities have allowed the expansion of a few species , such as the barn swallow and european star ##ling , they have caused population decreases or extinction in many other species . [SEP]
[CLS] over a hundred bird species have gone extinct in historical times , although the most dramatic human - caused av ##ian extinction ##s , era ##dic ##ating an estimated 750 – 1800 species , occurred during the human colon ##isation of mel ##ane ##sian , poly ##nesian , and micro ##nesian islands . [SEP]
[CLS] many bird populations are declining worldwide , with 1 , 227 species listed as threatened by bird ##life international and the iucn in 2009 . [SEP]
[CLS] the most commonly cited human threat to birds is habitat loss . [SEP]
[CLS] other threats include over ##hun ##ting , accidental mortality due to collisions with buildings or vehicles , long - line fishing by ##cat ##ch , pollution ( including oil spill ##s and pest ##icide use ) , competition and pre ##dation from non ##nat ##ive invasive species , and climate change . [SEP]
[CLS] governments and conservation groups work to protect birds , either by passing laws that preserve and restore bird habitat or by establishing captive populations for rein ##tro ##duction ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] such projects have produced some successes ; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004 , including the california condor and norfolk para ##kee ##t . [SEP]
