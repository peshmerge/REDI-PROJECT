[CLS] in botany , a fruit is the seed - bearing structure in flowering plants ( also known as ang ##ios ##per ##ms ) formed from the o ##vary after flowering . [SEP]
[CLS] edible fruits , in particular , have prop ##aga ##ted with the movements of humans and animals in a sy ##mb ##iot ##ic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition ; in fact , humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food . [SEP]
[CLS] in common language usage , " fruit " normally means the flesh ##y seed - associated structures of a plant that are sweet or sour , and edible in the raw state , such as apples , bananas , grapes , lemon ##s , orange ##s , and straw ##berries . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , r ##hu ##bar ##b is often referred to as a fruit , because it is used to make sweet dessert ##s such as pie ##s , though only the pet ##iol ##e ( leaf stalk ) of the r ##hu ##bar ##b plant is edible , and edible gym ##nos ##per ##m seeds are often given fruit names , e . g . , gin ##k ##go nuts and pine nuts . [SEP]
[CLS] the outer , often edible layer , is the " per ##ica ##rp " , formed from the o ##vary and surrounding the seeds , although in some species other tissues contribute to or form the edible portion . [SEP]
[CLS] the o ##vu ##les are fe ##rti ##lized in a process that starts with poll ##ination , which involves the movement of pollen from the st ##amen ##s to the stigma of flowers . [SEP]
[CLS] after poll ##ination , a tube grows from the pollen through the stigma into the o ##vary to the o ##vu ##le and two sperm are transferred from the pollen to the mega ##game ##top ##hy ##te . [SEP]
[CLS] within the mega ##game ##top ##hy ##te one of the two sperm unite ##s with the egg , forming a z ##y ##go ##te , and the second sperm enters the central cell forming the end ##os ##per ##m mother cell , which completes the double fe ##rti ##lization process . [SEP]
[CLS] later the z ##y ##go ##te will give rise to the embryo of the seed , and the end ##os ##per ##m mother cell will give rise to end ##os ##per ##m , a nut ##rit ##ive tissue used by the embryo . [SEP]
[CLS] as the o ##vu ##les develop into seeds , the o ##vary begins to ripe ##n and the o ##vary wall , the " per ##ica ##rp " , may become flesh ##y ( as in berries or dr ##up ##es ) , or form a hard outer covering ( as in nuts ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in some multi ##see ##ded fruits , the extent to which the flesh develops is proportional to the number of fe ##rti ##lized o ##vu ##les . [SEP]
[CLS] in some fruits , especially simple fruits derived from an inferior o ##vary , other parts of the flower ( such as the floral tube , including the petals , sep ##als , and st ##amen ##s ) , fuse with the o ##vary and ripe ##n with it . [SEP]
[CLS] the grouping ##s are not evolution ##ari ##ly relevant , since many diverse plant taxa may be in the same group , but reflect how the flower organs are arranged and how the fruits develop . [SEP]
[CLS] simple fruits can be either dry or flesh ##y , and result from the ripe ##ning of a simple or compound o ##vary in a flower with only one pi ##sti ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] types of simple , flesh ##y , fruits ( with examples ) include : an aggregate fruit , or " eta ##eri ##o " , develops from a single flower with numerous simple pi ##sti ##ls . [SEP]
[CLS] the po ##me fruits of the family rosa ##ceae , ( including apples , pear ##s , rose ##hips , and saskatoon berry ) are a sync ##ar ##po ##us flesh ##y fruit , a simple fruit , developing from a half - inferior o ##vary . [SEP]
[CLS] sc ##hi ##zo ##car ##p fruits form from a sync ##ar ##po ##us o ##vary and do not really de ##his ##ce , but rather split into segments with one or more seeds ; they include a number of different forms from a wide range of families . [SEP]
[CLS] aggregate fruits form from single flowers that have multiple carp ##els which are not joined together , i . e . [SEP]
[CLS] ran ##un ##cula ##ceae species , including " cl ##ema ##tis " and " ran ##un ##culus " have an eta ##eri ##o of ache ##nes , " cal ##ot ##rop ##is " has an eta ##eri ##o of f ##oll ##icles , and " rub ##us " species like ras ##p ##berry , have an eta ##eri ##o of dr ##up ##ele ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] in some bram ##ble fruits ( such as blackberry ) the rec ##ept ##acle is elongated and part of the ripe fruit , making the blackberry an " aggregate - accessory " fruit . [SEP]
[CLS] in all these examples , the fruit develops from a single flower with numerous pi ##sti ##ls . [SEP]
[CLS] each flower produces a fruit , but these mature into a single mass . [SEP]
[CLS] first an in ##fl ##orescence of white flowers called a head is produced . [SEP]
[CLS] after fe ##rti ##lization , each flower develops into a dr ##up ##e , and as the dr ##up ##es expand , they become " con ##nate " ( merge ) into a " multiple flesh ##y fruit " called a " sync ##ar ##p " . [SEP]
[CLS] berries are another type of flesh ##y fruit ; they are simple fruit created from a single o ##vary . [SEP]
[CLS] some or all of the edible part of accessory fruit is not generated by the o ##vary . [SEP]
[CLS] accessory fruit can be simple , aggregate , or multiple , i . e . , they can include one or more pi ##sti ##ls and other parts from the same flower , or the pi ##sti ##ls and other parts of many flowers . [SEP]
[CLS] some cult ##ivar ##s of citrus fruits ( especially grape ##fr ##uit , mandarin orange ##s , nave ##l orange ##s ) , sat ##sum ##as , table grapes , and water ##mel ##ons are valued for their seed ##lessness . [SEP]
[CLS] in some species , seed ##lessness is the result of " part ##hen ##oca ##rp ##y " , where fruits set without fe ##rti ##lization . [SEP]
[CLS] seed ##less bananas and grapes are trip ##loid ##s , and seed ##lessness results from the abortion of the embryo ##nic plant that is produced by fe ##rti ##lization , a phenomenon known as " ste ##nos ##per ##mo ##car ##py " , which requires normal poll ##ination and fe ##rti ##lization . [SEP]
[CLS] variations in fruit structures largely depend on their seeds ' mode of dispersal . [SEP]
[CLS] some fruits have coats covered with spikes or hooked burr ##s , either to prevent themselves from being eaten by animals , or to stick to the feathers , hairs , or legs of animals , using them as dispersal agents . [SEP]
[CLS] the sweet flesh of many fruits is " deliberately " appealing to animals , so that the seeds held within are eaten and " un ##wi ##tting ##ly " carried away and deposited ( i . e . , def ##eca ##ted ) at a distance from the parent . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , the nut ##rit ##ious , oil ##y kernel ##s of nuts are appealing to rodents ( such as squirrels ) , which ho ##ard them in the soil to avoid starving during the winter , thus giving those seeds that remain une ##ate ##n the chance to ge ##rmin ##ate and grow into a new plant away from their parent . [SEP]
[CLS] other fruits are elongated and flattened out naturally , and so become thin , like wings or helicopter blades , e . g . , elm , maple , and tu ##lip ##tree . [SEP]
[CLS] this is an evolutionary mechanism to increase dispersal distance away from the parent , via wind . [SEP]
[CLS] some other fruits that can disperse via water are ni ##pa palm and screw pine . [SEP]
[CLS] some fruits fling seeds substantial distances ( up to 100 m in sand ##box tree ) via explosive de ##his ##cence or other mechanisms , e . g . , imp ##ati ##ens and sq ##ui ##rting cu ##cum ##ber . [SEP]
[CLS] many hundreds of fruits , including flesh ##y fruits ( like apple , ki ##wi ##fr ##uit , mango , peach , pear , and water ##mel ##on ) are commercially valuable as human food , eaten both fresh and as jam ##s , mar ##mal ##ade and other preserves . [SEP]
[CLS] fresh fruits are generally high in fiber , vitamin c , and water . [SEP]
[CLS] regular consumption of fruit is generally associated with reduced risks of several diseases and functional declines associated with aging . [SEP]
[CLS] because fruits have been such a major part of the human diet , various cultures have developed many different uses for fruits they do not depend on for food . [SEP]
[CLS] for food safety , the cdc recommends proper fruit handling and preparation to reduce the risk of food contamination and food ##borne illness . [SEP]
[CLS] fresh fruits and vegetables should be carefully selected ; at the store , they should not be damaged or bruised ; and pre ##cut pieces should be ref ##ri ##ger ##ated or surrounded by ice . [SEP]
[CLS] this recommendation also applies to produce with ri ##nds or skins that are not eaten . [SEP]
[CLS] fruits and vegetables should be kept separate from raw foods like meat , poultry , and seafood , as well as from ut ##ens ##ils that have come in contact with raw foods . [SEP]
[CLS] fruits and vegetables that are not going to be cooked should be thrown away if they have touched raw meat , poultry , seafood , or eggs . [SEP]
[CLS] all cut , peeled , or cooked fruits and vegetables should be ref ##ri ##ger ##ated within two hours . [SEP]
[CLS] after a certain time , harmful bacteria may grow on them and increase the risk of food ##borne illness . [SEP]
[CLS] all fruits benefit from proper post harvest care , and in many fruits , the plant hormone et ##hyl ##ene causes ripe ##ning . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , maintaining most fruits in an efficient cold chain is optimal for post harvest storage , with the aim of extending and ensuring shelf life . [SEP]
