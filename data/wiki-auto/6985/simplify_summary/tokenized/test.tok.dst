[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l ( also ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ) is any of several related green pigment ##s found in the me ##sos ##ome ##s of cy ##ano ##ba ##cter ##ia , as well as in the ch ##lor ##op ##las ##ts of algae and plants . [SEP]
[CLS] its name is derived from the greek words , ( " pale green " ) and , ( " leaf " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is essential in photos ##yn ##thesis , allowing plants to absorb energy from light . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##ls absorb light most strongly in the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum as well as the red portion . [SEP]
[CLS] conversely , it is a poor absorb ##er of green and near - green portions of the spectrum , which it reflects , producing the green color of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l - containing tissues . [SEP]
[CLS] two types of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l exist in the photos ##yst ##em ##s of green plants : ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l a and b . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l was first isolated and named by joseph bien ##ai ##me cave ##nto ##u and pierre joseph pe ##llet ##ier in 1817 . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence of magnesium in ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l was discovered in 1906 , and was the first time that magnesium had been detected in living tissue . [SEP]
[CLS] after initial work done by german chemist richard wills ##tat ##ter spanning from 1905 to 1915 , the general structure of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l " a " was el ##uc ##ida ##ted by hans fischer in 1940 . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1960 , when most of the stereo ##chemist ##ry of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l " a " was known , robert burns woodward published a total synthesis of the molecule . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1967 , the last remaining stereo ##chemical el ##uc ##ida ##tion was completed by ian fleming , and in 1990 woodward and co - authors published an updated synthesis . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l f was announced to be present in cy ##ano ##ba ##cter ##ia and other oxygen ##ic micro ##org ##ani ##sms that form st ##rom ##ato ##lite ##s in 2010 ; a molecular formula of cho ##n ##mg and a structure of ( 2 - form ##yl ) - ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l " a " were de ##duced based on nm ##r , optical and mass spectra . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is vital for photos ##yn ##thesis , which allows plants to absorb energy from light . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l molecules are arranged in and around photos ##yst ##em ##s that are embedded in the thy ##lak ##oid membranes of ch ##lor ##op ##las ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] in these complexes , ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l serves three functions . [SEP]
[CLS] the function of the vast majority of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l ( up to several hundred molecules per photos ##yst ##em ) is to absorb light . [SEP]
[CLS] having done so , these same centers execute their second function : the transfer of that light energy by resonance energy transfer to a specific ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l pair in the reaction center of the photos ##yst ##em ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this pair effects the final function of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##ls , charge separation , leading to bio ##sy ##nt ##hesis . [SEP]
[CLS] the two currently accepted photos ##yst ##em units are photos ##yst ##em ii and photos ##yst ##em i , which have their own distinct reaction centres , named p ##6 ##80 and p ##70 ##0 , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] these centres are named after the wavelength ( in nano ##meter ##s ) of their red - peak absorption maximum . [SEP]
[CLS] the identity , function and spectral properties of the types of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l in each photos ##yst ##em are distinct and determined by each other and the protein structure surrounding them . [SEP]
[CLS] once extracted from the protein into a solvent ( such as ace ##tone or met ##han ##ol ) , these ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l pigment ##s can be separated into ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l a and ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l b . [SEP]
[CLS] the function of the reaction center of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is to absorb light energy and transfer it to other parts of the photos ##yst ##em . [SEP]
[CLS] the absorbed energy of the photon is transferred to an electron in a process called charge separation . [SEP]
[CLS] the removal of the electron from the ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is an oxidation reaction . [SEP]
[CLS] the ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l donate ##s the high energy electron to a series of molecular intermediate ##s called an electron transport chain . [SEP]
[CLS] the charged reaction center of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l ( p ##6 ##80 ) is then reduced back to its ground state by accepting an electron stripped from water . [SEP]
[CLS] the electron that reduces p ##6 ##80 ultimately comes from the oxidation of water into o and h through several intermediate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this reaction is how photos ##yn ##the ##tic organisms such as plants produce o gas , and is the source for practically all the o in earth ' s atmosphere . [SEP]
[CLS] photos ##yst ##em i typically works in series with photos ##yst ##em ii ; thus the p ##70 ##0 of photos ##yst ##em i is usually reduced as it accepts the electron , via many intermediate ##s in the thy ##lak ##oid membrane , by electrons coming , ultimately , from photos ##yst ##em ii . [SEP]
[CLS] electron transfer reactions in the thy ##lak ##oid membranes are complex , however , and the source of electrons used to reduce p ##70 ##0 can vary . [SEP]
[CLS] the electron flow produced by the reaction center ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l pigment ##s is used to pump h ions across the thy ##lak ##oid membrane , setting up a che ##mi ##os ##mot ##ic potential used mainly in the production of atp ( stored chemical energy ) or to reduce nad ##p to nad ##ph . [SEP]
[CLS] nad ##ph is a universal agent used to reduce co into sugar ##s as well as other bio ##sy ##nt ##hetic reactions . [SEP]
[CLS] reaction center ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l – protein complexes are capable of directly absorbing light and performing charge separation events without the assistance of other ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l pigment ##s , but the probability of that happening under a given light intensity is small . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the other ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##ls in the photos ##yst ##em and antenna pigment proteins all cooperative ##ly absorb and funnel light energy to the reaction center . [SEP]
[CLS] besides ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l " a " , there are other pigment ##s , called accessory pigment ##s , which occur in these pigment – protein antenna complexes . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##ls are numerous in types , but all are defined by the presence of a fifth ring beyond the four p ##yr ##rol ##e - like rings . [SEP]
[CLS] most ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##ls are classified as ch ##lor ##ins , which are reduced relatives to por ##phy ##rin ##s ( found in hem ##og ##lo ##bin ) . [SEP]
[CLS] they share a common bio ##sy ##nt ##hetic pathway with por ##phy ##rin ##s , including the precursor ur ##op ##or ##phy ##rino ##gen iii . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike hem ##es , which feature iron at the center of the te ##tra ##py ##rro ##le ring , ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##ls bind magnesium . [SEP]
[CLS] for the structures depicted in this article , some of the ligand ##s attached to the mg center are omitted for clarity . [SEP]
[CLS] the ch ##lor ##in ring can have various side chains , usually including a long ph ##yt ##ol chain . [SEP]
[CLS] the most widely distributed form in terrestrial plants is ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l " a " . [SEP]
[CLS] these compounds have also been identified in several ripe ##ning fruits . [SEP]
[CLS] measurement of the absorption of light is complicated by the solvent used to extract the ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l from plant material , which affects the values obtained , [SEP]
[CLS] by measuring the absorption of light in the red and far red regions , it is possible to estimate the concentration of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l within a leaf . [SEP]
[CLS] ratio flu ##orescence emission can be used to measure ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l content . [SEP]
[CLS] by exciting ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l " a " flu ##orescence at a lower wavelength , the ratio of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l flu ##orescence emission at and can provide a linear relationship of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l content when compared to chemical testing . [SEP]
[CLS] the ratio " f " / " f " provided a correlation value of " r " 0 . 96 compared to chemical testing in the range from 41 mg m up to 67 ##5 mg m . gi ##tel ##son also developed a formula for direct read ##out of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l content in mg m . [SEP]
[CLS] the formula provided a reliable method of measuring ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l content from 41 mg m up to 67 ##5 mg m with a correlation " r " value of 0 . 95 . [SEP]
[CLS] in plants , ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l may be synthesized from su ##cci ##ny ##l - coa and g ##ly ##cine , although the immediate precursor to ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l " a " and " b " is proto ##ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##lide . [SEP]
[CLS] in ang ##ios ##per ##m plants , the last step , the conversion of proto ##ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##lide to ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l , is light - dependent and such plants are pale ( et ##iol ##ated ) if grown in darkness . [SEP]
[CLS] non - vascular plants and green algae have an additional light - independent enzyme and grow green even in darkness . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l itself is bound to proteins and can transfer the absorbed energy in the required direction . [SEP]
[CLS] proto ##ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##lide occurs mostly in the free form and , under light conditions , acts as a photos ##ens ##iti ##zer , forming highly toxic free radicals . [SEP]
[CLS] hence , plants need an efficient mechanism of regulating the amount of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l precursor . [SEP]
[CLS] in ang ##ios ##per ##ms , this is done at the step of amino ##lev ##ulin ##ic acid ( ala ) , one of the intermediate compounds in the bio ##sy ##nt ##hesis pathway . [SEP]
[CLS] plants that are fed by ala accumulate high and toxic levels of proto ##ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##lide ; so do the mutants with the damaged regulatory system . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##osis is a condition in which leaves produce insufficient ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l , turning them yellow . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##osis can be caused by a nutrient deficiency of iron — called iron ch ##lor ##osis — or by a shortage of magnesium or nitrogen . [SEP]
[CLS] soil ph sometimes plays a role in nutrient - caused ch ##lor ##osis ; many plants are adapted to grow in soils with specific ph levels and their ability to absorb nutrients from the soil can be dependent on this . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##osis can also be caused by pathogen ##s including viruses , bacteria and fungal infections , or sap - sucking insects . [SEP]
[CLS] ant ##ho ##cy ##ani ##ns are other plant pigment ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the absorb ##ance pattern responsible for the red color of ant ##ho ##cy ##ani ##ns may be complementary to that of green ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l in photos ##yn ##the ##tically active tissues such as young " que ##rcus co ##cci ##fera " leaves . [SEP]
[CLS] it may protect the leaves from attacks by plant eater ##s that may be attracted by green color . [SEP]
[CLS] the ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l maps show mill ##ig ##ram ##s of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l per cubic meter of sea ##water each month . [SEP]
[CLS] places where ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l amounts were very low , indicating very low numbers of ph ##yt ##op ##lan ##kt ##on , are blue . [SEP]
[CLS] places where ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l concentrations were high , meaning many ph ##yt ##op ##lan ##kt ##on were growing , are yellow . [SEP]
[CLS] the observations come from the moderate resolution imaging spec ##tro ##rad ##iom ##eter ( mod ##is ) on nasa ' s aqua satellite . [SEP]
[CLS] land is dark gray , and places where mod ##is could not collect data because of sea ice , polar darkness , or clouds are light gray . the highest ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l concentrations , where tiny surface - dwelling ocean plants are thriving , are in cold polar waters or in places where ocean currents bring cold water to the surface , such as around the equator and along the shores of continents . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not the cold water itself that stimulate ##s the ph ##yt ##op ##lan ##kt ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , the cool temperatures are often a sign that the water has well ##ed up to the surface from deeper in the ocean , carrying nutrients that have built up over time . [SEP]
[CLS] in polar waters , nutrients accumulate in surface waters during the dark winter months when plants cannot grow . [SEP]
[CLS] when sunlight returns in the spring and summer , the plants flourish in high concentrations . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is registered as a food additive ( color ##ant ) , and its e number is e ##14 ##0 . [SEP]
[CLS] chefs use ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l to color a variety of foods and beverages green , such as pasta and spirits . [SEP]
[CLS] abs ##int ##he gains its green color naturally from the ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l introduced through the large variety of herbs used in its production . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is not soluble in water , and it is first mixed with a small quantity of vegetable oil to obtain the desired solution . [SEP]
