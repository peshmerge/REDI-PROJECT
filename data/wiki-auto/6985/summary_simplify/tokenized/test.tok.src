[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l ( also ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ) is any of several related green pigment ##s found in the me ##sos ##ome ##s of cy ##ano ##ba ##cter ##ia , as well as in the ch ##lor ##op ##las ##ts of algae and plants . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##ls absorb light most strongly in the blue portion of the electromagnetic spectrum as well as the red portion . [SEP]
[CLS] conversely , it is a poor absorb ##er of green and near - green portions of the spectrum , which it reflects , producing the green color of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l - containing tissues . [SEP]
[CLS] two types of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l exist in the photos ##yst ##em ##s of green plants : ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l a and b . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l was first isolated and named by joseph bien ##ai ##me cave ##nto ##u and pierre joseph pe ##llet ##ier in 1817 . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence of magnesium in ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l was discovered in 1906 , and was the first time that magnesium had been detected in living tissue . [SEP]
[CLS] after initial work done by german chemist richard wills ##tat ##ter spanning from 1905 to 1915 , the general structure of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l " a " was el ##uc ##ida ##ted by hans fischer in 1940 . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l f was announced to be present in cy ##ano ##ba ##cter ##ia and other oxygen ##ic micro ##org ##ani ##sms that form st ##rom ##ato ##lite ##s in 2010 ; a molecular formula of cho ##n ##mg and a structure of ( 2 - form ##yl ) - ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l " a " were de ##duced based on nm ##r , optical and mass spectra . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l molecules are arranged in and around photos ##yst ##em ##s that are embedded in the thy ##lak ##oid membranes of ch ##lor ##op ##las ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] having done so , these same centers execute their second function : the transfer of that light energy by resonance energy transfer to a specific ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l pair in the reaction center of the photos ##yst ##em ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the identity , function and spectral properties of the types of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l in each photos ##yst ##em are distinct and determined by each other and the protein structure surrounding them . [SEP]
[CLS] once extracted from the protein into a solvent ( such as ace ##tone or met ##han ##ol ) , these ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l pigment ##s can be separated into ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l a and ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l b . [SEP]
[CLS] the function of the reaction center of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is to absorb light energy and transfer it to other parts of the photos ##yst ##em . [SEP]
[CLS] the absorbed energy of the photon is transferred to an electron in a process called charge separation . [SEP]
[CLS] the removal of the electron from the ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l is an oxidation reaction . [SEP]
[CLS] the ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l donate ##s the high energy electron to a series of molecular intermediate ##s called an electron transport chain . [SEP]
[CLS] the charged reaction center of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l ( p ##6 ##80 ) is then reduced back to its ground state by accepting an electron stripped from water . [SEP]
[CLS] the electron that reduces p ##6 ##80 ultimately comes from the oxidation of water into o and h through several intermediate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this reaction is how photos ##yn ##the ##tic organisms such as plants produce o gas , and is the source for practically all the o in earth ' s atmosphere . [SEP]
[CLS] photos ##yst ##em i typically works in series with photos ##yst ##em ii ; thus the p ##70 ##0 of photos ##yst ##em i is usually reduced as it accepts the electron , via many intermediate ##s in the thy ##lak ##oid membrane , by electrons coming , ultimately , from photos ##yst ##em ii . [SEP]
[CLS] the electron flow produced by the reaction center ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l pigment ##s is used to pump h ions across the thy ##lak ##oid membrane , setting up a che ##mi ##os ##mot ##ic potential used mainly in the production of atp ( stored chemical energy ) or to reduce nad ##p to nad ##ph . [SEP]
[CLS] nad ##ph is a universal agent used to reduce co into sugar ##s as well as other bio ##sy ##nt ##hetic reactions . [SEP]
[CLS] reaction center ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l â€“ protein complexes are capable of directly absorbing light and performing charge separation events without the assistance of other ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l pigment ##s , but the probability of that happening under a given light intensity is small . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the other ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##ls in the photos ##yst ##em and antenna pigment proteins all cooperative ##ly absorb and funnel light energy to the reaction center . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##ls are numerous in types , but all are defined by the presence of a fifth ring beyond the four p ##yr ##rol ##e - like rings . [SEP]
[CLS] most ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##ls are classified as ch ##lor ##ins , which are reduced relatives to por ##phy ##rin ##s ( found in hem ##og ##lo ##bin ) . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike hem ##es , which feature iron at the center of the te ##tra ##py ##rro ##le ring , ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##ls bind magnesium . [SEP]
[CLS] measurement of the absorption of light is complicated by the solvent used to extract the ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l from plant material , which affects the values obtained , [SEP]
[CLS] by measuring the absorption of light in the red and far red regions , it is possible to estimate the concentration of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l within a leaf . [SEP]
[CLS] by exciting ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l " a " flu ##orescence at a lower wavelength , the ratio of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l flu ##orescence emission at and can provide a linear relationship of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l content when compared to chemical testing . [SEP]
[CLS] in ang ##ios ##per ##m plants , the last step , the conversion of proto ##ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##lide to ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l , is light - dependent and such plants are pale ( et ##iol ##ated ) if grown in darkness . [SEP]
[CLS] ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l itself is bound to proteins and can transfer the absorbed energy in the required direction . [SEP]
[CLS] proto ##ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##lide occurs mostly in the free form and , under light conditions , acts as a photos ##ens ##iti ##zer , forming highly toxic free radicals . [SEP]
[CLS] hence , plants need an efficient mechanism of regulating the amount of ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l precursor . [SEP]
[CLS] soil ph sometimes plays a role in nutrient - caused ch ##lor ##osis ; many plants are adapted to grow in soils with specific ph levels and their ability to absorb nutrients from the soil can be dependent on this . [SEP]
[CLS] the absorb ##ance pattern responsible for the red color of ant ##ho ##cy ##ani ##ns may be complementary to that of green ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l in photos ##yn ##the ##tically active tissues such as young " que ##rcus co ##cci ##fera " leaves . [SEP]
[CLS] land is dark gray , and places where mod ##is could not collect data because of sea ice , polar darkness , or clouds are light gray . the highest ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l concentrations , where tiny surface - dwelling ocean plants are thriving , are in cold polar waters or in places where ocean currents bring cold water to the surface , such as around the equator and along the shores of continents . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , the cool temperatures are often a sign that the water has well ##ed up to the surface from deeper in the ocean , carrying nutrients that have built up over time . [SEP]
[CLS] chefs use ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l to color a variety of foods and beverages green , such as pasta and spirits . [SEP]
[CLS] abs ##int ##he gains its green color naturally from the ch ##lor ##op ##hyl ##l introduced through the large variety of herbs used in its production . [SEP]
