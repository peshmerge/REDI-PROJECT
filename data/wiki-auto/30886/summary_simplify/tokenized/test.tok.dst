[CLS] this improvement over a naturally as ##pi ##rated engine ' s power output is due to the fact that the compressor can force more air — and proportion ##ately more fuel — into the combustion chamber than atmospheric pressure ( and for that matter , ram air intake ##s ) alone . [SEP]
[CLS] the key difference between a turbo ##cha ##rger and a conventional super ##cha ##rger is that a super ##cha ##rger is mechanically driven by the engine , often through a belt connected to the crank ##shaft , whereas a turbo ##cha ##rger is powered by a turbine driven by the engine ' s exhaust gas . [SEP]
[CLS] compared with a mechanically driven super ##cha ##rger , turbo ##cha ##rger ##s tend to be more efficient , but less responsive . [SEP]
[CLS] forced induction dates from the late 19th century , when got ##tl ##ie ##b dai ##mler patented the technique of using a gear - driven pump to force air into an internal combustion engine in 1885 . [SEP]
[CLS] the turbo ##cha ##rger was invented by swiss engineer alfred bu ##chi ( 1879 – 1959 ) , the head of diesel engine research at ge ##br ##uder sul ##zer ( now simply called sul ##zer ) , engine manufacturing company in winter ##th ##ur , who received a patent in 1905 for using a compressor driven by exhaust gases to force air into an internal combustion engine to increase power output , but it took another 20 years for the idea to come to fruit ##ion . [SEP]
[CLS] the engine was tested at pike ##s peak in colorado at 1400 ##0 ft to demonstrate that it could eliminate the power loss usually experienced in internal combustion engines as a result of reduced air pressure and density at high altitude . [SEP]
[CLS] turbo ##cha ##rger ##s were first used in production aircraft engines such as the napier lion ##ess in the 1920s , although they were less common than engine - driven cent ##ri ##fu ##gal super ##cha ##rger ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] turbo ##cha ##rger ##s were also used in aviation , most widely used by the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] during world war ii , notable examples of u . s . aircraft with turbo ##cha ##rger ##s — which included mass - produced ones designed by general electric for american aviation use — include the b - 17 flying fortress , b - 24 li ##ber ##ator , p - 38 lightning , and p - 47 thunder ##bolt . [SEP]
[CLS] the technology was also used in experimental fitting ##s by a number of other manufacturers , notably a variety of experimental inline engine - powered f ##ock ##e - wu ##lf f ##w 190 prototype models , with some developments for their design coming from the d ##v ##l , a predecessor of today ' s dl ##r agency , but the need for advanced high - temperature metals in the turbine , that were not readily available for production purposes during wartime , kept them out of widespread use . [SEP]
[CLS] turbo ##cha ##rger ##s are widely used in car and commercial vehicles because they allow smaller - capacity engines to have improved fuel economy , reduced emissions , higher power and considerably higher torque . [SEP]
[CLS] belts , chains , shafts , and gears are common methods of power ##ing a super ##cha ##rger , placing a mechanical load on the engine . [SEP]
[CLS] this is where the principal disadvantage of a super ##cha ##rger becomes apparent ; the engine must withstand the net power output of the engine plus the power to drive the super ##cha ##rger . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , for a given volume and pressure of air , the turbo ##charged air is cooler , and as a result dense ##r , containing more oxygen molecules , and therefore more potential power than the super ##charged air . [SEP]
[CLS] in practical application the di ##spar ##ity between the two can be dramatic , with turbo ##cha ##rger ##s often producing 15 % to 30 % more power based solely on the differences in adi ##aba ##tic efficiency ( however , due to heat transfer from the hot exhaust , considerable heating does occur ) . [SEP]
[CLS] by comparison , a turbo ##cha ##rger does not place a direct mechanical load on the engine , although turbo ##cha ##rger ##s place exhaust back pressure on engines , increasing pumping losses . [SEP]
[CLS] this is more efficient because while the increased back pressure taxes the piston exhaust stroke , much of the energy driving the turbine is provided by the still - expanding exhaust gas that would otherwise be wasted as heat through the tail ##pipe . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the time between the demand for an increase in power ( the throttle being opened ) and the turbo ##cha ##rger ( s ) providing increased intake pressure , and hence increased power . [SEP]
[CLS] in variable output systems such as automobile engines , exhaust gas pressure at idle , low engine speeds , or low throttle is usually insufficient to drive the turbine . [SEP]
[CLS] only when the engine reaches sufficient speed does the turbine section start to " sp ##ool up , " or spin fast enough to produce intake pressure above atmospheric pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of electro - motive diesel ' s two - stroke engines , the mechanically assisted turbo ##cha ##rger is not specifically a twin ##cha ##rger , as the engine uses the mechanical assistance to charge air only at lower engine speeds and startup . [SEP]
[CLS] this differs from a turbo ##cha ##rger that uses the compressor section of the turbo - compressor only during starting and , as a two - stroke engines cannot naturally as ##pi ##rate , and , according to sa ##e definitions , a two - stroke engine with a mechanically assisted compressor during idle and low throttle is considered naturally as ##pi ##rated . [SEP]
[CLS] in naturally as ##pi ##rated piston engines , intake gases are drawn or " pushed " into the engine by atmospheric pressure filling the volume ##tric void caused by the downward stroke of the piston ( which creates a low - pressure area ) , similar to drawing liquid using a sy ##ring ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] the amount of air actually inspired , compared with the theoretical amount if the engine could maintain atmospheric pressure , is called volume ##tric efficiency . [SEP]
[CLS] the objective of a turbo ##cha ##rger is to improve an engine ' s volume ##tric efficiency by increasing density of the intake gas ( usually air ) allowing more power per engine cycle . [SEP]
[CLS] the turbo ##cha ##rger ' s compressor draws in ambient air and com ##press ##es it before it enters into the intake manifold at increased pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] this results in a greater mass of air entering the cylinders on each intake stroke . [SEP]
[CLS] the power needed to spin the cent ##ri ##fu ##gal compressor is derived from the kinetic energy of the engine ' s exhaust gases . [SEP]
[CLS] in automotive applications , ' boost ' refers to the amount by which intake manifold pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] modern turbo ##cha ##rger ##s can use waste ##gate ##s , blow - off valves and variable geometry , as discussed in later sections . [SEP]
[CLS] in petrol engine turbo ##cha ##rger applications , boost pressure is limited to keep the entire engine system , including the turbo ##cha ##rger , inside its thermal and mechanical design operating range . [SEP]
[CLS] opening the waste ##gate allows the excess energy destined for the turbine to bypass it and pass directly to the exhaust pipe , thus reducing boost pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] the waste ##gate can be either controlled manually ( frequently seen in aircraft ) or by an act ##ua ##tor ( in automotive applications , it is often controlled by the engine control unit ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a turbo ##cha ##rger may also be used to increase fuel efficiency without increasing power . [SEP]
[CLS] this is achieved by divert ##ing exhaust waste energy , from the combustion process , and feeding it back into the turbo ' s " hot " intake side that spins the turbine . [SEP]
[CLS] as the hot turbine side is being driven by the exhaust energy , the cold intake turbine ( the other side of the turbo ) com ##press ##es fresh intake air and drives it into the engine ' s intake . [SEP]
[CLS] by using this otherwise wasted energy to increase the mass of air , it becomes easier to ensure that all fuel is burned before being vent ##ed at the start of the exhaust stage . [SEP]
[CLS] to compensate for lower - density air at higher altitudes ) . [SEP]
[CLS] since atmospheric pressure reduces as the aircraft climbs , power drops as a function of altitude in normally as ##pi ##rated engines . [SEP]
[CLS] systems that use a turbo ##cha ##rger to maintain an engine ' s sea - level power output are called turbo - normal ##ized systems . [SEP]
[CLS] turbo ##cha ##rger la ##g ( turbo la ##g ) is the time required to change power output in response to a throttle change , noticed as a hesitation or slowed " throttle response " when accelerating as compared to a naturally as ##pi ##rated engine . [SEP]
[CLS] this is due to the time needed for the exhaust system and turbo ##cha ##rger to generate the required boost which can also be referred to as sp ##ool ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] super ##cha ##rger ##s do not suffer this problem , because the turbine is eliminated due to the compressor being directly powered by the engine . [SEP]
[CLS] turbo ##cha ##rger applications can be categorized into those that require changes in output power ( such as automotive ) and those that do not ( such as marine , aircraft , commercial automotive , industrial , engine - generators , and locomotives ) . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes turbo la ##g is mistaken for engine speeds that are below boost threshold . [SEP]
[CLS] if engine speed is below a turbo ##cha ##rger ' s boost threshold rpm then the time needed for the vehicle to build speed and rpm could be considerable , maybe even tens of seconds for a heavy vehicle starting at low vehicle speed in a high gear . [SEP]
[CLS] this wait for vehicle speed increase is not turbo la ##g , it is improper gear selection for boost demand . [SEP]
[CLS] once the vehicle reaches sufficient speed to provide the required rpm to reach boost threshold , there will be a far shorter delay while the turbo itself builds rotational energy and transitions to positive boost , only this last part of the delay in achieving positive boost is the turbo la ##g . [SEP]
[CLS] it uses an electric motor to bring the turbo ##cha ##rger up to operating speed quicker than possible using available exhaust gases . [SEP]
[CLS] an alternative to e - boost ##ing is to completely separate the turbine and compressor into a turbine - generator and electric - compressor as in the hybrid turbo ##cha ##rger . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1981 , a similar system that used a hydraulic drive system and overs ##peed clutch arrangement accelerated the turbo ##cha ##rger of the mv " canadian pioneer " ( do ##x ##ford 76 ##j ##4 ##cr engine ) . [SEP]
[CLS] turbo ##cha ##rger ##s start producing boost only when a certain amount of kinetic energy is present in the exhaust gas ##ses . [SEP]
[CLS] without adequate exhaust gas flow to spin the turbine blades , the turbo ##cha ##rger cannot produce the necessary force needed to com ##press the air going into the engine . [SEP]
[CLS] energy provided for the turbine work is converted from the en ##thal ##py and kinetic energy of the gas . [SEP]
[CLS] often the same basic turbo ##cha ##rger assembly is available from the manufacturer with multiple housing choices for the turbine , and sometimes the compressor cover as well . [SEP]
[CLS] the turbine and imp ##eller wheel sizes also di ##cta ##te the amount of air or exhaust that can flow through the system , and the relative efficiency at which they operate . [SEP]
[CLS] in general , the larger the turbine wheel and compressor wheel the larger the flow capacity . [SEP]
[CLS] measurements and shapes can vary , as well as curvature and number of blades on the wheels . [SEP]
[CLS] large turbo ##cha ##rger ##s take more heat and pressure to spin the turbine , creating la ##g at low speed . [SEP]
[CLS] small turbo ##cha ##rger ##s spin quickly , but may not have the same performance at high acceleration . [SEP]
[CLS] twin - turbo or bi - turbo designs have two separate turbo ##cha ##rger ##s operating in either a sequence or in parallel . [SEP]
[CLS] in a parallel configuration , both turbo ##cha ##rger ##s are fed one - half of the engine ' s exhaust . [SEP]
[CLS] in a sequential setup one turbo ##cha ##rger runs at low speeds and the second turns on at a pre ##de ##ter ##mined engine speed or load . [SEP]
[CLS] they are connected in a series so that boost pressure from one turbo ##cha ##rger is multiplied by another , hence the name " 2 - stage . " [SEP]
[CLS] the distribution of exhaust gas is continuously variable , so the transition from using the small turbo ##cha ##rger to the large one can be done inc ##rem ##ental ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] smaller turbo ##cha ##rger ##s have less turbo la ##g than larger ones , so often two small turbo ##cha ##rger ##s are used instead of one large one . [SEP]
[CLS] twin - scroll or divided turbo ##cha ##rger ##s have two exhaust gas inlet ##s and two no ##zzle ##s , a smaller sharpe ##r angled one for quick response and a larger less angled one for peak performance . [SEP]
[CLS] with high - performance cam ##shaft timing , exhaust valves in different cylinders can be open at the same time , overlapping at the end of the power stroke in one cylinder and the end of exhaust stroke in another . [SEP]
[CLS] in twin - scroll designs , the exhaust manifold physically separates the channels for cylinders that can interfere with each other , so that the pu ##ls ##ating exhaust gas ##ses flow through separate spiral ##s ( scrolls ) . [SEP]
[CLS] their angle is adjusted by an act ##ua ##tor to block or increase air flow to the turbine . [SEP]
[CLS] this variability maintains a comparable exhaust velocity and back pressure throughout the engine ' s rev range . [SEP]
[CLS] the compressor increases the mass of intake air entering the combustion chamber . [SEP]
[CLS] ported sh ##roud the flow range of a turbo ##cha ##rger compressor can be increased by allowing air to bleed from a ring of holes or a circular groove around the compressor at a point slightly downstream of the compressor inlet ( but far nearer to the inlet than to the outlet ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the ported sh ##roud is a performance enhancement that allows the compressor to operate at significantly lower flows . [SEP]
[CLS] allowing some air to escape at this location inhibit ##s the onset of surge and widen ##s the operating range . [SEP]
[CLS] increases in compressor efficiency result in slightly cooler ( more dense ) intake air , which improves power . [SEP]
[CLS] the ability of the compressor to provide high boost at low rpm may also be increased marginal ##ly ( because near choke conditions the compressor draws air inward through the bleed path ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the center hub rotating assembly ( ch ##ra ) houses the shaft that connects the compressor imp ##eller and turbine . [SEP]
[CLS] water - cooled models use engine cool ##ant to keep lu ##bri ##cating oil cooler , avoiding possible oil co ##king ( destructive di ##sti ##llation of engine oil ) from the extreme heat in the turbine . [SEP]
[CLS] ball bearings designed to support high speeds and temperatures are sometimes used instead of fluid bearings to support the turbine shaft . [SEP]
[CLS] some variable no ##zzle turbo ##cha ##rger ##s use a rotary electric act ##ua ##tor , which uses a direct steppe ##r motor to open and close the vane ##s , rather than p ##ne ##umatic controllers that operate based on air pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] this occurrence can be explained through gay - lu ##ssa ##c ' s law , stating that the pressure of a given amount of gas held at constant volume is directly proportional to the kelvin temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] with more pressure being added to the engine through the turbo ##cha ##rger , overall temperatures of the engine will also rise . [SEP]
[CLS] the warmer the intake air , the less dense , and the less oxygen available for the combustion event , which reduces volume ##tric efficiency . [SEP]
[CLS] to compensate for the increase in temperature , turbo ##cha ##rger units often make use of an inter ##co ##ole ##r between successive stages of boost to cool down the intake air . [SEP]
[CLS] a " charge air cooler " is an air cooler between the boost stage ( s ) and the app ##lian ##ce that consume ##s the boosted air . [SEP]
[CLS] it can be either mounted on top , parallel to the engine , or mounted near the lower front of the vehicle . [SEP]
[CLS] top - mount inter ##co ##ole ##rs setup ##s will result in a decrease in turbo la ##g , due in part by the location of the inter ##co ##ole ##r being much closer to the turbo ##cha ##rger outlet and throttle body . [SEP]
[CLS] this closer proximity reduces the time it takes for air to travel through the system , producing power sooner , compared to that of a front - mount inter ##co ##ole ##r which has more distance for the air to travel to reach the outlet and throttle . [SEP]
[CLS] front - mount inter ##co ##ole ##rs can have the potential to give better cooling compared to that of a top - mount . [SEP]
[CLS] the area in which a top - mounted inter ##co ##ole ##r is located , is near one of the hottest areas of a car , right above the engine . [SEP]
[CLS] this is why most manufacturers include large hood scoop ##s to help feed air to the inter ##co ##ole ##r while the car is moving , but while idle , the hood scoop provides little to no benefit . [SEP]
[CLS] even while moving , when the atmospheric temperatures begin to rise , top - mount inter ##co ##ole ##rs tend to under ##per ##form compared to front - mount inter ##co ##ole ##rs . [SEP]
[CLS] with more distance to travel , the air circulated through a front - mount inter ##co ##ole ##r may have more time to cool . [SEP]
[CLS] an alternative to inter ##co ##olin ##g is in ##ject ##ing water into the intake air to reduce the temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] when in ##ject ##ing the mixture into the intake stream , the air is cooled as the liquids eva ##por ##ate . [SEP]
[CLS] inside the combustion chamber it slow ##s the flame , acting similar to higher oct ##ane fuel . [SEP]
[CLS] met ##han ##ol / water mixture allows for higher compression because of the less det ##ona ##tion - prone and , thus , safer combustion inside the engine . [SEP]
[CLS] the amount of extra fuel varies , but typically reduces the air - fuel ratio to between 11 and 13 , instead of the st ##oic ##hi ##ometric 14 . 7 ( in petrol engines ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the extra fuel is not burned ( as there is insufficient oxygen to complete the chemical reaction ) , instead it undergoes a phase change from atom ##ized ( liquid ) to gas . [SEP]
[CLS] it can be controlled by a boost pressure assisted , generally vacuum hose attachment point dia ##ph ##rag ##m ( for vacuum and positive pressure to return commonly oil contaminated waste to the emissions system ) to force the spring - loaded dia ##ph ##rag ##m to stay closed until the over ##bo ##ost point is sensed by the ec ##u or a sole ##no ##id operated by the engine ' s electronic control unit or a boost controller , but most production vehicles use a single vacuum hose attachment point spring - loaded dia ##ph ##rag ##m that can alone be pushed open , thus limiting over ##bo ##ost ability due to exhaust gas pressure forcing open the waste ##gate . [SEP]
[CLS] turbo ##charged engines operating at wide open throttle and high rpm require a large volume of air to flow between the turbo ##cha ##rger and the inlet of the engine . [SEP]
[CLS] in this situation , the surge can raise the pressure of the air to a level that can cause damage . [SEP]
[CLS] this is because if the pressure rises high enough , a compressor stall occurs — stored press ##urized air deco ##mp ##resses backward across the imp ##eller and out the inlet . [SEP]
[CLS] the reverse flow back across the turbo ##cha ##rger makes the turbine shaft reduce in speed more quickly than it would naturally , possibly damaging the turbo ##cha ##rger . [SEP]
[CLS] to prevent this from happening , a valve is fitted between the turbo ##cha ##rger and inlet , which vents off the excess air pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] recycling back into the turbo ##cha ##rger inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass - air ##flow fuel injection system , because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the mass air ##flow sensor causes an excessive ##ly rich fuel mixture — because the mass - air ##flow sensor has already accounted for the extra air that is no longer being used . [SEP]
[CLS] valves that rec ##y ##cle the air also short ##en the time needed to re - sp ##ool the turbo ##cha ##rger after sudden engine dec ##ele ##ration , since load on the turbo ##cha ##rger when the valve is active is much lower than if the air charge vents to atmosphere . [SEP]
[CLS] free floating turbo ##cha ##rger ##s produce more horsepower because they have less back ##press ##ure , but are not drive ##able in performance applications without an external waste ##gate . [SEP]
[CLS] today , most automotive diesel ##s are turbo ##charged , since the use of turbo ##cha ##rg ##ing improved efficiency , drive ##ability and performance of diesel engines , greatly increasing their popularity . [SEP]
[CLS] several japanese companies produced turbo ##charged high - performance motorcycles in the early 1980s , such as the c ##x ##500 turbo from honda - a transverse ##ly mounted , liquid cooled v - twin also available in naturally as ##pi ##rated form . [SEP]
[CLS] this is partially due to an abundance of larger displacement , naturally as ##pi ##rated engines being available that offer the torque and power benefits of a smaller displacement engine with turbo ##cha ##rger , but do return more linear power characteristics . [SEP]
[CLS] however , since the charge in the cylinders is pushed in by this air pressure , the engine normally produces only half - power at full throttle at this altitude . [SEP]
[CLS] since the size of the turbo ##cha ##rger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude , the turbo ##cha ##rger is oversized for low altitude . [SEP]
[CLS] the speed of the turbo ##cha ##rger is controlled by a waste ##gate . [SEP]
[CLS] early systems used a fixed waste ##gate , resulting in a turbo ##cha ##rger that functioned much like a super ##cha ##rger . [SEP]
[CLS] as the aircraft climbs and the air density drops , the waste ##gate must continuously close in small inc ##rem ##ents to maintain full power . [SEP]
[CLS] when the aircraft climbs above the critical altitude , engine power output decreases as altitude increases , just as it would in a naturally as ##pi ##rated engine . [SEP]
[CLS] with older super ##charged aircraft without automatic boost control , the pilot must continually adjust the throttle to maintain the required manifold pressure during ascent or descent . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , modern turbo ##cha ##rger systems use an automatic waste ##gate , which controls the manifold pressure within parameters pre ##set by the manufacturer . [SEP]
[CLS] for these systems , as long as the control system is working properly and the pilot ' s control commands are smooth and deliberate , a turbo ##cha ##rger cannot over - boost the engine and damage it . [SEP]
[CLS] yet the majority of world war ii engines used super ##cha ##rger ##s , because they maintained three significant manufacturing advantages over turbo ##cha ##rger ##s , which were larger , involved extra pip ##ing , and required exotic high - temperature materials in the turbine and pre - turbine section of the exhaust system . [SEP]
[CLS] the size of the pip ##ing alone is a serious issue ; american fighters vo ##ught f ##4 ##u and republic p - 47 used the same engine , but the huge barrel - like fuselage of the latter was , in part , needed to hold the pip ##ing to and from the turbo ##cha ##rger in the rear of the plane . [SEP]
[CLS] turbo ##charged piston engines are also subject to many of the same operating restrictions as gas turbine engines . [SEP]
[CLS] pilots must make smooth , slow throttle adjustments to avoid overs ##hoot ##ing their target manifold pressure . [SEP]
[CLS] the fuel / air mixture must often be adjusted far on the rich side of st ##oic ##hi ##ometric combustion needs to avoid pre - ignition or det ##ona ##tion in the engine when running at high power settings . [SEP]
[CLS] in systems using a manually operated waste ##gate , the pilot must be careful not to exceed the turbo ##cha ##rger ' s maximum rpm . [SEP]
[CLS] the great majority of world war ii american heavy bombers used by the usa ##af , particularly the wright r - 1820 " cyclone - 9 " powered b - 17 flying fortress , and pratt & whitney r - 1830 twin wasp powered consolidated b - 24 li ##ber ##ator four - engine bombers both used similar models of general electric - designed turbo ##cha ##rger ##s in service , as did the twin allison v - 1710 - engined lockheed p - 38 lightning american heavy fighter during the war years . [SEP]
[CLS] all of the above wwii aircraft engines had mechanically driven cent ##ri ##fu ##gal super ##cha ##rger ##s as - designed from the start , and the turbo ##su ##per ##cha ##rger ##s ( with inter ##co ##ole ##rs ) were added , effectively as twin ##cha ##rger systems , to achieve desired altitude performance . [SEP]
[CLS] modern aviation piston engines designed to run at high altitudes typically include a turbo ##cha ##rger ( either high pressure or turbo ##nor ##mal ##ized ) rather than a super ##cha ##rger . [SEP]
[CLS] as the turbo ##charged aircraft climbs , however , the pilot ( or automated system ) can close the waste ##gate , forcing more exhaust gas through the turbo ##cha ##rger turbine , thereby maintaining manifold pressure during the climb , at least until the critical pressure altitude is reached ( when the waste ##gate is fully closed ) , after which manifold pressure falls . [SEP]
[CLS] with such systems , modern high - performance piston engine aircraft can cruise at altitudes up to 25 , 000 feet ( above which , rv ##sm certification would be required ) , where low air density results in lower drag and higher true airs ##peed ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in this specific application , mainly electro - motive diesel ( em ##d ) 56 ##7 , 64 ##5 , and 710 series engines , the turbo ##cha ##rger is initially driven by the engine ' s crank ##shaft through a gear train and an overrun ##ning clutch , thereby providing as ##piration for combustion . [SEP]
[CLS] after combustion has been achieved , and after the exhaust gases have reached sufficient heat energy , the overrun ##ning clutch is automatically di ##sen ##ga ##ged , and the turbo - compressor is thereafter driven exclusively by the exhaust gases . [SEP]
[CLS] this is particularly beneficial at high altitudes , as are often encountered on western u . s . railroads . [SEP]
[CLS] it is possible for the turbo ##cha ##rger to rev ##ert to compressor mode momentarily during commands for large increases in engine power . [SEP]
[CLS] honey ##well turbo technologies , borg warner and mitsubishi turbo ##cha ##rger are the largest manufacturers in europe and the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] in europe 67 percent of all vehicles were turbo ##charged in 2014 , which is expected to grow to 69 percent by 2019 . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , more than 90 percent of turbo ##cha ##rger ##s were diesel , however , adoption in gasoline engines is increasing . [SEP]
[CLS] if successful , government subsidies would be based on the corporate average fuel economy ( cafe ) standards rather than supporting specific technologies like electric cars . [SEP]
[CLS] turbo ##cha ##rger sales in the united states increased when the federal government boosted corporate average fuel economy targets to 35 . 5 mp ##g by 2016 . [SEP]
