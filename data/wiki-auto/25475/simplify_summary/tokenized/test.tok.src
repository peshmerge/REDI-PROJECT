[CLS] a role - playing game ( sometimes spelled role ##play ##ing game ; abbreviated rpg ) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting . [SEP]
[CLS] players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative , either through literal acting , or through a process of structured decision - making regarding character development . [SEP]
[CLS] actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines . [SEP]
[CLS] there are several forms of role - playing games . [SEP]
[CLS] the original form , sometimes called the tablet ##op role - playing game ( tr ##pg ) , is conducted through discussion , whereas in live action role - playing ( la ##rp ) , players physically perform their characters ' actions . [SEP]
[CLS] in both of these forms , an arranger called a game master ( gm ) usually decides on the rules and setting to be used , while acting as the referee ; each of the other players takes on the role of a single character . [SEP]
[CLS] several varieties of rpg also exist in electronic media , such as multiplayer text - based multi - user dungeons ( mud ##s ) and their graphics - based successors , massive ##ly multiplayer online role - playing games ( mm ##or ##pg ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] role - playing games also include single - player role - playing video games in which players control a character , or team of characters , who undertake ( s ) quest ##s , and may include player capabilities that advance using statistical mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] these electronic games sometimes share settings and rules with tablet ##op rpg ##s , but emphasize character advancement more than collaborative storytelling . [SEP]
[CLS] this type of game is well - established , so some rpg - related game forms , such as trading / collect ##ible card games ( cc ##gs ) and war ##games , may not be included under the definition . [SEP]
[CLS] some amount of role - playing activity may be present in such games , but it is not the primary focus . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " role - playing game " is also sometimes used to describe games involving role ##play simulation and exercises used in teaching , training , and academic research . [SEP]
[CLS] both authors and major publishers of tablet ##op role - playing games consider them to be a form of interactive and collaborative storytelling . [SEP]
[CLS] events , characters , and narrative structure give a sense of a narrative experience , and the game need not have a strongly - defined storyline . [SEP]
[CLS] interact ##ivity is the crucial difference between role - playing games and traditional fiction . [SEP]
[CLS] whereas a viewer of a television show is a passive observer , a player in a role - playing game makes choices that affect the story . [SEP]
[CLS] such role - playing games extend an older tradition of storytelling games where a small party of friends collaborate to create a story . [SEP]
[CLS] while simple forms of role - playing exist in traditional children ' s games of make believe , role - playing games add a level of so ##phi ##stic ##ation and persistence to this basic idea with additions such as game fa ##ci ##lita ##tors and rules of interaction . [SEP]
[CLS] participants in a role - playing game will generate specific characters and an ongoing plot . [SEP]
[CLS] a consistent system of rules and a more or less realistic campaign setting in games aids suspension of disbelief . [SEP]
[CLS] the level of realism in games ranges from just enough internal consistency to set up a bel ##ie ##vable story or credible challenge up to full - blown simulations of real - world processes . [SEP]
[CLS] role - playing games are played in a wide variety of formats ranging from discussing character interaction in tablet ##op form to physically acting out characters in la ##rp to playing characters virtually in digital media . [SEP]
[CLS] there is also a great variety of systems of rules and game settings . [SEP]
[CLS] games that emphasize plot and character interaction over game mechanics and combat sometimes prefer the name storytelling game . [SEP]
[CLS] these types of games tend to minimize or altogether eliminate the use of dice or other random ##izing elements . [SEP]
[CLS] some games are played with characters created before the game by the gm , rather than those created by the players . [SEP]
[CLS] this type of game is typically played at gaming conventions , or in standalone games that do not form part of a campaign . [SEP]
[CLS] tablet ##op and " pen - and - paper " ( p ##np ) rpg ##s are conducted through discussion in a small social gathering . [SEP]
[CLS] the gm describes the game world and its inhabitants . [SEP]
[CLS] the other players describe the intended actions of their characters , and the gm describes the outcomes . [SEP]
[CLS] some outcomes are determined by the game system , and some are chosen by the gm . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the format in which role - playing games were first popularized . [SEP]
[CLS] the first commercially available rpg , " dungeons & dragons " ( d & d ) , was inspired by fantasy literature and the war ##gami ##ng hobby and was published in 1974 . [SEP]
[CLS] the popularity of d & d led to the birth of the tablet ##op role - playing game industry , which publishes games with many different themes , rules , and styles of play . [SEP]
[CLS] the popularity of tablet ##op games has decreased since the modern releases of online mm ##o rpg ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this format is often referred to simply as a " role - playing game " . [SEP]
[CLS] to distinguish this form of rpg from other formats , the retro ##ny ##ms " tablet ##op role - playing game " or " pen and paper role - playing game " are sometimes used , though neither a table nor pen and paper are strictly necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] a la ##rp is played more like improvisation ##al theatre . [SEP]
[CLS] participants act out their characters ' actions instead of describing them , and the real environment is used to represent the imaginary setting of the game world . [SEP]
[CLS] players are often costume ##d as their characters and use appropriate props , and the venue may be decorated to resemble the fictional setting . [SEP]
[CLS] some live action role - playing games use rock - paper - scissors or comparison of attributes to resolve conflicts symbolic ##ally , while other la ##rp ##s use physical combat with simulated arms such as airs ##oft guns or foam weapons . [SEP]
[CLS] la ##rp ##s vary in size from a handful of players to several thousand , and in duration from a couple of hours to several days . [SEP]
[CLS] because the number of players in a la ##rp is usually larger than in a tablet ##op role - playing game , and the players may be interacting in separate physical spaces , there is typically less of an emphasis on tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players , and game sessions are often managed in a more distributed manner . [SEP]
[CLS] tablet ##op role - playing games have been translated into a variety of electronic formats . [SEP]
[CLS] as early as 1974 , the same year as the release of dungeons & dragons , un ##lice ##nsed versions of it were developed on main ##frame university systems under titles such as " d ##nd " and " dungeon " . [SEP]
[CLS] these early computer rpg ##s influenced all of electronic gaming , as well as spawning the role - playing video game genre . [SEP]
[CLS] some authors divide digital role - playing games into two inter ##twined groups : single player games using rpg - style mechanics , and multiplayer games incorporating social interaction . [SEP]
[CLS] single player role - playing video games form a loosely defined genre of computer and console games with origins in role - playing games such as " dungeons & dragons " , on which they base much of their terminology , settings , and game mechanics . [SEP]
[CLS] this translation changes the experience of the game , providing a visual representation of the world but emphasizing statistical character development over collaborative , interactive storytelling . [SEP]
[CLS] online text - based role - playing games involve many players using some type of text - based interface and an internet connection to play an rpg . [SEP]
[CLS] games played in a real - time way include mud ##s , mu ##sh ##es , and other varieties of mu * . [SEP]
[CLS] games played in a turn - based fashion include play - by - mail games and play - by - post games . [SEP]
[CLS] massive ##ly multiplayer online role - playing games ( mm ##or ##pg ##s ) combine the large - scale social interaction and persistent world of mud ##s with graphic interfaces . [SEP]
[CLS] most mm ##or ##pg ##s do not actively promote in - character role - playing , however players can use the games ' communication functions to role - play so long as other players cooperate . [SEP]
[CLS] the majority of players in mm ##or ##pg ##s do not engage in role - play in this sense . [SEP]
[CLS] computer - assisted gaming can be used to add elements of computer gaming to in - person tablet ##op role - playing , where computers are used for record - keeping and sometimes to resolve combat , while the participants generally make decisions concerning character interaction . [SEP]
[CLS] one common feature of many rpg ##s is the role of game ##master , a participant who has special duties to present the fictional setting , ar ##bit ##rate the results of character actions , and maintain the narrative flow . [SEP]
[CLS] in tablet ##op and live action rpg ##s the gm performs these duties in person . [SEP]
[CLS] in video rpg ##s many of the functions of a gm are fulfilled by the game engine . [SEP]
[CLS] however some multi - player video rpg ##s also allow for a participant to take on a gm role through a visual interface called a " gm tool ##kit " , albeit with abilities limited by the available technology . [SEP]
[CLS] another standard concept in rpg ##s is the player character , a character in the fictional world of the game whose actions the player controls . [SEP]
[CLS] typically each player controls a separate player character , sometimes more , each of whom acts as a protagonist in the story . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast to player characters , non - player characters ( np ##cs ) are controlled by the game ##master or game engine , or by people assisting the game ##master . [SEP]
[CLS] non - player characters fill out the population of the fictional setting and can act as antagonist ##s , by ##stand ##ers or allies of the player characters . [SEP]
