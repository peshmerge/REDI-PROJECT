[CLS] in geometry , a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d is a three - dimensional figure formed by six parallel ##og ##ram ##s ( the term r ##hom ##bo ##id is also sometimes used with this meaning ) . [SEP]
[CLS] by analogy , it relates to a parallel ##og ##ram just as a cube relates to a square or as a cub ##oid to a rec ##tangle . [SEP]
[CLS] in euclidean geometry , its definition encompasses all four concepts ( i . e . , " parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d " , " parallel ##og ##ram " , " cube " , and " square " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in this context of af ##fine geometry , in which angles are not differentiated , its definition admits only " parallel ##og ##ram ##s " and " parallel ##ep ##ipe ##ds " . [SEP]
[CLS] three equivalent definitions of " parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d " are the rectangular cub ##oid ( six rectangular faces ) , cube ( six square faces ) , and the r ##hom ##bo ##hedron ( six r ##hom ##bus faces ) are all specific cases of parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] " parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d " is now usually pronounced , , or ; traditionally it was in accordance with its etymology in greek π ##α ##ρ ##α ##λ ##λ ##η ##λ - ε ##π ##ι ##π ##ε ##δ ##ο ##ν , a body " having parallel planes " . [SEP]
[CLS] parallel ##ep ##ipe ##ds are a sub ##class of the prism ##ato ##ids . [SEP]
[CLS] any of the three pairs of parallel faces can be viewed as the base planes of the prism . [SEP]
[CLS] a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d has three sets of four parallel edges ; the edges within each set are of equal length . [SEP]
[CLS] parallel ##ep ##ipe ##ds result from linear transformations of a cube ( for the non - de ##gen ##erate cases : the bi ##ject ##ive linear transformations ) . [SEP]
[CLS] since each face has point symmetry , a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d is a z ##ono ##hedron . [SEP]
[CLS] also the whole parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d has point symmetry " c " ( see also tri ##cl ##ini ##c ) . [SEP]
[CLS] each face is , seen from the outside , the mirror image of the opposite face . [SEP]
[CLS] the faces are in general chi ##ral , but the parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d is not . [SEP]
[CLS] a space - filling tess ##ella ##tion is possible with cong ##ru ##ent copies of any parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d can be considered as an oblique prism with a parallel ##og ##ram as base . [SEP]
[CLS] hence the volume formula _ 1 of a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d is the product of the base area formula _ 2 and the height formula _ 3 ( see diagram ) . [SEP]
[CLS] with ( where formula _ 5 is the angle between the vectors formula _ 6 and formula _ 7 ) and the height formula _ 8 ( formula _ 9 is the angle between vector formula _ 10 and the normal of the base ) one gets the mixed product of three vectors is called triple product . [SEP]
[CLS] it can be described by a deter ##mina ##nt . [SEP]
[CLS] an alternative representation of the volume uses geometric properties ( angles and length of edges ) only : with formula _ 16 and formula _ 17 the edge lengths . [SEP]
[CLS] let be formula _ 18 the 3 ##x ##3 - matrix , whose columns are the vectors formula _ 19 ( see above ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the volume of any te ##tra ##hedron that shares three con ##ver ##ging edges of a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d has a volume equal to one sixth of the volume of that parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d ( see proof ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a " perfect parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d " is a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d with integer - length edges , face diagonal ##s , and space diagonal ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2009 , dozens of perfect parallel ##ep ##ipe ##ds were shown to exist , answering an open question of richard guy . [SEP]
[CLS] one example has edges 271 , 106 , and 103 , minor face diagonal ##s 101 , 266 , and 255 , major face diagonal ##s 183 , 312 , and 323 , and space diagonal ##s 37 ##4 , 300 , 278 , and 272 . [SEP]
[CLS] some perfect parallel ##op ##ipe ##ds having two rectangular faces are known . [SEP]
[CLS] but it is not known whether there exist any with all faces rectangular ; such a case would be called a perfect cub ##oid . [SEP]
[CLS] cox ##eter called the general ##ization of a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d in higher dimensions a parallel ##oto ##pe . [SEP]
[CLS] specifically in " n " - dimensional space it is called " n " - dimensional parallel ##oto ##pe , or simply " n " - parallel ##oto ##pe . [SEP]
[CLS] thus a parallel ##og ##ram is a 2 - parallel ##oto ##pe and a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d is a 3 - parallel ##oto ##pe . [SEP]
[CLS] more generally a parallel ##oto ##pe , or " vo ##ron ##oi parallel ##oto ##pe " , has parallel and cong ##ru ##ent opposite face ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] so a 2 - parallel ##oto ##pe is a parallel ##ogo ##n which can also include certain he ##xa ##gon ##s , and a 3 - parallel ##oto ##pe is a parallel ##oh ##ed ##ron , including 5 types of poly ##hed ##ra . [SEP]
[CLS] the diagonal ##s of an " n " - parallel ##oto ##pe intersect at one point and are bis ##ect ##ed by this point . [SEP]
[CLS] inversion in this point leaves the " n " - parallel ##oto ##pe unchanged . [SEP]
[CLS] see also fixed points of iso ##metry groups in euclidean space . [SEP]
[CLS] the edges radiating from one vertex of a " k " - parallel ##oto ##pe form a " k " - frame formula _ 25 of the vector space , and the parallel ##oto ##pe can be recovered from these vectors , by taking linear combinations of the vectors , with weights between 0 and 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] the " n " - volume of an " n " - parallel ##oto ##pe embedded in formula _ 26 where formula _ 27 can be computed by means of the gram deter ##mina ##nt . [SEP]
[CLS] if " m " = " n " , this amounts to the absolute value of the deter ##mina ##nt of the " n " vectors . [SEP]
[CLS] another formula to compute the volume of an " n " - parallel ##oto ##pe " p " in formula _ 29 , whose " n " + 1 vertices are formula _ 30 , is [SEP]
[CLS] where formula _ 32 is the row vector formed by the con ##cate ##nation of formula _ 33 and 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , the deter ##mina ##nt is unchanged if formula _ 34 is sub ##tracted from formula _ 32 ( " i " > 0 ) , and placing formula _ 34 in the last position only changes its sign . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , the volume of any " n " - simple ##x that shares " n " con ##ver ##ging edges of a parallel ##oto ##pe has a volume equal to one 1 / " n " ! [SEP]
[CLS] of the volume of that parallel ##oto ##pe . [SEP]
[CLS] the word appears as " parallel ##ip ##ipe ##don " in sir henry billings ##ley ' s translation of eu ##cl ##id ' s elements , dated 1570 . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1644 edition of his " cu ##rs ##us math ##ema ##ticus " , pierre her ##igo ##ne used the spelling " parallel ##ep ##ipe ##du ##m " . [SEP]
[CLS] the " oxford english dictionary " cites the present - day " parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d " as first appearing in walter char ##leton ' s " cho ##rea gig ##ant ##um " ( 1663 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] charles hutton ' s dictionary ( 1795 ) shows " parallel ##op ##ipe ##d " and " parallel ##op ##ipe ##don " , showing the influence of the combining form " parallel ##o - " , as if the second element were " pipe ##don " rather than " ep ##ipe ##don " . [SEP]
[CLS] noah webster ( 1806 ) includes the spelling " parallel ##op ##ipe ##d " . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1989 edition of the " oxford english dictionary " describes " parallel ##op ##ipe ##d " ( and " parallel ##ip ##ipe ##d " ) explicitly as incorrect forms , but these are listed without comment in the 2004 edition , and only pronunciation ##s with the emphasis on the fifth syllable " pi " ( / pa ##ɪ / ) are given . [SEP]
[CLS] a change away from the traditional pronunciation has hidden the different partition suggested by the greek roots , with " ep ##i - " ( " on " ) and " pe ##don " ( " ground " ) combining to give " ep ##ipe ##d " , a flat " plane " . [SEP]
[CLS] thus the faces of a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d are plan ##ar , with opposite faces being parallel . [SEP]
