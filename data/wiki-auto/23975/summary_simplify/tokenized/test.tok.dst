[CLS] in geometry , a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d is a three - dimensional figure formed by six parallel ##og ##ram ##s ( the term r ##hom ##bo ##id is also sometimes used with this meaning ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in this context of af ##fine geometry , in which angles are not differentiated , its definition admits only " parallel ##og ##ram ##s " and " parallel ##ep ##ipe ##ds " . [SEP]
[CLS] three equivalent definitions of " parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d " are the rectangular cub ##oid ( six rectangular faces ) , cube ( six square faces ) , and the r ##hom ##bo ##hedron ( six r ##hom ##bus faces ) are all specific cases of parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] any of the three pairs of parallel faces can be viewed as the base planes of the prism . [SEP]
[CLS] a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d has three sets of four parallel edges ; the edges within each set are of equal length . [SEP]
[CLS] since each face has point symmetry , a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d is a z ##ono ##hedron . [SEP]
[CLS] the faces are in general chi ##ral , but the parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d is not . [SEP]
[CLS] a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d can be considered as an oblique prism with a parallel ##og ##ram as base . [SEP]
[CLS] hence the volume formula _ 1 of a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d is the product of the base area formula _ 2 and the height formula _ 3 ( see diagram ) . [SEP]
[CLS] with ( where formula _ 5 is the angle between the vectors formula _ 6 and formula _ 7 ) and the height formula _ 8 ( formula _ 9 is the angle between vector formula _ 10 and the normal of the base ) one gets the mixed product of three vectors is called triple product . [SEP]
[CLS] an alternative representation of the volume uses geometric properties ( angles and length of edges ) only : with formula _ 16 and formula _ 17 the edge lengths . [SEP]
[CLS] the volume of any te ##tra ##hedron that shares three con ##ver ##ging edges of a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d has a volume equal to one sixth of the volume of that parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d ( see proof ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2009 , dozens of perfect parallel ##ep ##ipe ##ds were shown to exist , answering an open question of richard guy . [SEP]
[CLS] cox ##eter called the general ##ization of a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d in higher dimensions a parallel ##oto ##pe . [SEP]
[CLS] so a 2 - parallel ##oto ##pe is a parallel ##ogo ##n which can also include certain he ##xa ##gon ##s , and a 3 - parallel ##oto ##pe is a parallel ##oh ##ed ##ron , including 5 types of poly ##hed ##ra . [SEP]
[CLS] the diagonal ##s of an " n " - parallel ##oto ##pe intersect at one point and are bis ##ect ##ed by this point . [SEP]
[CLS] see also fixed points of iso ##metry groups in euclidean space . [SEP]
[CLS] the edges radiating from one vertex of a " k " - parallel ##oto ##pe form a " k " - frame formula _ 25 of the vector space , and the parallel ##oto ##pe can be recovered from these vectors , by taking linear combinations of the vectors , with weights between 0 and 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] the " n " - volume of an " n " - parallel ##oto ##pe embedded in formula _ 26 where formula _ 27 can be computed by means of the gram deter ##mina ##nt . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , the volume of any " n " - simple ##x that shares " n " con ##ver ##ging edges of a parallel ##oto ##pe has a volume equal to one 1 / " n " ! [SEP]
[CLS] the word appears as " parallel ##ip ##ipe ##don " in sir henry billings ##ley ' s translation of eu ##cl ##id ' s elements , dated 1570 . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1644 edition of his " cu ##rs ##us math ##ema ##ticus " , pierre her ##igo ##ne used the spelling " parallel ##ep ##ipe ##du ##m " . [SEP]
[CLS] the " oxford english dictionary " cites the present - day " parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d " as first appearing in walter char ##leton ' s " cho ##rea gig ##ant ##um " ( 1663 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] charles hutton ' s dictionary ( 1795 ) shows " parallel ##op ##ipe ##d " and " parallel ##op ##ipe ##don " , showing the influence of the combining form " parallel ##o - " , as if the second element were " pipe ##don " rather than " ep ##ipe ##don " . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1989 edition of the " oxford english dictionary " describes " parallel ##op ##ipe ##d " ( and " parallel ##ip ##ipe ##d " ) explicitly as incorrect forms , but these are listed without comment in the 2004 edition , and only pronunciation ##s with the emphasis on the fifth syllable " pi " ( / pa ##Éª / ) are given . [SEP]
[CLS] thus the faces of a parallel ##ep ##ipe ##d are plan ##ar , with opposite faces being parallel . [SEP]
