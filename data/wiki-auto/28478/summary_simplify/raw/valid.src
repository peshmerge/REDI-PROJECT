Skiing can be a means of transport, a recreational activity or a competitive winter sport in which the participant uses skis to glide on snow.
Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski Federation (FIS).
The word "ski" is one of a handful of words that Norway has exported to the international community.
Asymmetrical skis were used in northern Finland and Sweden until at least the late 19th century.
The underside of the short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use, while the long ski supporting the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in a similar manner to modern ski waxing.
Skiing was primarily used for transport until the mid-19th century, but since then has also become a recreation and sport.
Military ski races were held in Norway during the 18th century, and ski warfare was studied in the late 18th century.
As equipment evolved and ski lifts were developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, two main genres of skiing emerged—Alpine (downhill) skiing and Nordic skiing.
Facilities at resorts can include night skiing, après-ski, and glade skiing under the supervision of the ski patrol and the ski school.
Alpine skiing branched off from the older Nordic type of skiing around the 1920s when the advent of ski lifts meant that it was not necessary to walk any longer.
Alpine equipment has specialized to the point where it can now only be used with the help of lifts.
The Nordic disciplines include cross-country skiing and ski jumping, which both use bindings that attach at the toes of the skier's boots but not at the heels.
Telemark skiing is a ski turning technique and FIS-sanctioned discipline, which is named after the Telemark region of Norway.
It uses equipment similar to Nordic skiing, where the ski bindings are attached only at the toes of the ski boots, allowing the skier's heel to be raised throughout the turn.
The following disciplines are sanctioned by the FIS.
Many have their own world cups and are included in the Winter Olympic Games.
New parabolic designs like the Elan SCX have enabled the more modern carve turn.
A treadmill-like surface can also be used, to enable skiing while staying in the same place.
