[CLS] skiing can be a means of transport , a recreational activity or a competitive winter sport in which the participant uses ski ##s to glide on snow . [SEP]
[CLS] many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the international olympic committee ( ioc ) , and the international ski federation ( fis ) . [SEP]
[CLS] skiing has a history of almost five millennia . [SEP]
[CLS] although modern skiing has evolved from beginnings in scandinavia , it may have been practiced more than 100 centuries ago in what is now china , according to an interpretation of ancient paintings . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " ski " is one of a handful of words that norway has exported to the international community . [SEP]
[CLS] it comes from the old norse word " ski ##ð " which means " split piece of wood or fire ##wood " . [SEP]
[CLS] as ##ym ##metric ##al ski ##s were used in northern finland and sweden until at least the late 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] on one foot , the skier wore a long straight non - arching ski for sliding , and a shorter ski was worn on the other foot for kicking . [SEP]
[CLS] the underside of the short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use , while the long ski supporting the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in a similar manner to modern ski wax ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] early skier ##s used one long pole or spear . [SEP]
[CLS] the first depiction of a skier with two ski poles dates to 1741 . [SEP]
[CLS] skiing was primarily used for transport until the mid - 19th century , but since then has also become a recreation and sport . [SEP]
[CLS] military ski races were held in norway during the 18th century , and ski warfare was studied in the late 18th century . [SEP]
[CLS] as equipment evolved and ski lifts were developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries , two main genres of skiing emerged — alpine ( downhill ) skiing and nordic skiing . [SEP]
[CLS] the main difference between the two is the type of ski binding ( the way in which the ski boots are attached to the ski ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] also called " downhill skiing " , alpine skiing typically takes place on a pi ##ste at a ski resort . [SEP]
[CLS] it is characterized by fixed - heel binding ##s that attach at both the toe and the heel of the skier ' s boot . [SEP]
[CLS] ski lifts , including chair ##lift ##s , bring skier ##s up the slope . [SEP]
[CLS] back ##co ##unt ##ry skiing can be accessed by helicopter , snow ##cat , hiking and snow ##mobile . [SEP]
[CLS] facilities at resorts can include night skiing , apr ##es - ski , and glad ##e skiing under the supervision of the ski patrol and the ski school . [SEP]
[CLS] alpine skiing branched off from the older nordic type of skiing around the 1920s when the advent of ski lifts meant that it was not necessary to walk any longer . [SEP]
[CLS] alpine equipment has specialized to the point where it can now only be used with the help of lifts . [SEP]
[CLS] the nordic disciplines include cross - country skiing and ski jumping , which both use binding ##s that attach at the toes of the skier ' s boots but not at the heels . [SEP]
[CLS] cross - country skiing may be practiced on groom ##ed trails or in undeveloped back ##co ##unt ##ry areas . [SEP]
[CLS] ski jumping is practiced in certain areas that are reserved exclusively for ski jumping . [SEP]
[CLS] tel ##ema ##rk skiing is a ski turning technique and fis - sanctioned discipline , which is named after the tel ##ema ##rk region of norway . [SEP]
[CLS] it uses equipment similar to nordic skiing , where the ski binding ##s are attached only at the toes of the ski boots , allowing the skier ' s heel to be raised throughout the turn . [SEP]
[CLS] the following disciplines are sanctioned by the fis . [SEP]
[CLS] many have their own world cups and are included in the winter olympic games . [SEP]
[CLS] technique has evolved along with ski technology and ski geometry . [SEP]
[CLS] early techniques included the tel ##ema ##rk turn , the stem , the stem christie , snow ##pl ##ough , and parallel turn . [SEP]
[CLS] new para ##bolic designs like the el ##an sc ##x have enabled the more modern car ##ve turn . [SEP]
[CLS] originally and primarily a winter sport , skiing can also be practiced indoors without snow , outdoors on grass , on dry ski slopes , with ski simulator ##s , or with roller ski ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] a tread ##mill - like surface can also be used , to enable skiing while staying in the same place . [SEP]
[CLS] sand skiing involves sliding on sand instead of snow , but the skier uses conventional ski ##s , ski poles , binding ##s and boots . [SEP]
