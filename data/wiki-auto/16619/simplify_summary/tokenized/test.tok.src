[CLS] the ki ##logram ( also ki ##logram ##me ) is the base unit of mass in the metric system , formally the international system of units ( si ) , having the unit symbol kg . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a widely used measure in science , engineering , and commerce worldwide , and is often called a ki ##lo . [SEP]
[CLS] the ki ##logram is almost exactly the mass of one litre of water . [SEP]
[CLS] the ki ##logram was originally defined in 1795 as the mass of a litre of water . [SEP]
[CLS] this was a simple definition , but hard to replicate precisely . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1799 , the " ki ##logram ##me des archives " , a platinum arte ##fa ##ct , replaced it as the standard of mass . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1879 a cylinder of platinum - ir ##idium , the international prototype of the ki ##logram ( ip ##k ) became the standard of the unit of mass for the metric system , and remained so until may 20 , 2019 , making the ki ##logram the last of the metric base units to be defined by a physical arte ##fa ##ct . [SEP]
[CLS] despite best efforts to maintain it , evidence accumulated that the mass of the international prototype ki ##logram had been changing ; the ip ##k had diver ##ged from its replica ##s by approximately 50 micro ##gram ##s since their manufacture late in the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] this led to several competing efforts to develop measurement technology precise enough to allow replacing the ki ##logram arte ##fa ##ct with a definition based directly on physical fundamental constant ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this culminated in 2018 with a red ##ef ##ini ##tion of the ki ##logram in terms of the planck constant . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result of this red ##ef ##ini ##tion , the ki ##logram is now defined in terms of the second and the metre , replacing the ip ##k as primary standard . [SEP]
[CLS] the new definition was approved by the general conference on weights and measures ( c ##gp ##m ) on november 16 , 2018 . [SEP]
[CLS] physical standard masses such as the ip ##k and its replica ##s still serve as secondary standards . [SEP]
[CLS] the ki ##logram is defined in terms of three fundamental physical constant ##s : the speed of light c , a specific atomic transition frequency δ " ν " , and the planck constant h . [SEP]
[CLS] this definition makes the ki ##logram consistent with the older definitions : the mass remains almost exactly the same as the mass of a litre of water . [SEP]
[CLS] the development of the first metric system began about 1790 . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial mass unit was the grave , defined in 1793 . [SEP]
[CLS] within three years it was replaced by the ki ##logram . [SEP]
[CLS] the gram , 1 / 1000 of a ki ##logram , was provisional ##ly defined in 1795 as the mass of one cubic cent ##ime ##tre of water at the melting point of ice . [SEP]
[CLS] the ki ##logram ##me des archives was manufactured as a prototype in 1799 and served as a basis for the international prototype ki ##logram ( ip ##k ) in 1875 . [SEP]
[CLS] it had a mass equal to the mass of 1 d ##m of water under atmospheric pressure and at the temperature of its maximum density , which is approximately 4 °c . [SEP]
[CLS] the international prototype ki ##logram was commissioned by the general conference on weights and measures ( c ##gp ##m ) under the authority of the metre convention ( 1875 ) , and is in the custody of the international bureau of weights and measures ( bi ##pm ) who hold it on behalf of the c ##gp ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] the ip ##k was rarely used or handled . [SEP]
[CLS] copies of the ip ##k kept by national metro ##logy laboratories around the world were compared with the ip ##k in 1889 , 1948 , and 1989 to provide trace ##ability of measurements of mass anywhere in the world back to the ip ##k . [SEP]
[CLS] the ki ##logram was the last si unit that was directly defined by an arte ##fa ##ct rather than fundamental physical properties that could be independently reproduced in different laboratories . [SEP]
[CLS] three other base units ( cd , a , mo ##l ) and 17 derived units ( n , pa , j , w , c , v , f , ω , s , wb , t , h , kat , g ##y , sv , l ##m , l ##x ) in the si system were defined in relation to the ki ##logram , and thus its stability was important . [SEP]
[CLS] the definitions of only eight other named si units did not depend on the ki ##logram : those of temperature ( k , °c ) , time and frequency ( s , hz , b ##q ) , length ( m ) , and angle ( ra ##d , sr ) . [SEP]
[CLS] after the international prototype ki ##logram had been found to vary in mass over time relative to its reproduction ##s , the international committee for weights and measures ( ci ##pm ) recommended in 2005 that the ki ##logram be red ##efined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature . [SEP]
[CLS] at its 2011 meeting , the c ##gp ##m agreed in principle that the ki ##logram should be red ##efined in terms of the planck constant , " h " . [SEP]
[CLS] the decision was originally def ##erre ##d until 2014 ; in 2014 it was def ##erre ##d again until the next meeting . [SEP]
[CLS] ci ##pm proposed revised definitions of the si base units for consideration at the 26th c ##gp ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] the formal vote on 16 november 2018 approved the change . [SEP]
[CLS] the ki ##logram is the only base si unit with an si prefix ( " ki ##lo " ) as part of its name . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " ki ##logram ##me " or " ki ##logram " is derived from the french , which itself was a learned coinage , prefix ##ing the greek stem of " a thousand " to , a late latin term for " a small weight " , itself from greek . [SEP]
[CLS] the word was written into french law in 1795 , in the " decree of 18 ge ##rmin ##al " , which revised the provisional system of units introduced by the french national convention two years earlier , where the had been defined as weight of a cubic cent ##ime ##tre of water , equal to 1 / 1000 of a . [SEP]
[CLS] in the decree of 1795 , the term thus replaced , and replaced . [SEP]
[CLS] the french spelling was adopted in great britain when the word was used for the first time in english in 1795 , with the spelling " ki ##logram " being adopted in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united kingdom both spelling ##s are used , with " ki ##logram " having become by far the more common . [SEP]
[CLS] uk law regulating the units to be used when trading by weight or measure does not prevent the use of either spelling . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 19th century the french word , a short ##ening of , was imported into the english language where it has been used to mean both ki ##logram and kilometre . [SEP]
[CLS] while " ki ##lo " as an alternative is acceptable , to " the economist " for example , the canadian government ' s term ##ium plus system states that " si ( international system of units ) usage , followed in scientific and technical writing " does not allow its usage and it is described as " a common informal name " on russ row ##lett ' s dictionary of units of measurement . [SEP]
[CLS] when the united states congress gave the metric system legal status in 1866 , it permitted the use of the word " ki ##lo " as an alternative to the word " ki ##logram " , but in 1990 revoked the status of the word " ki ##lo " . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 19th century , the standard system of metric units was the cent ##ime ##tre – gram – second system of units , treating the gram as the fundamental unit of mass and the " ki ##logram " as a derived unit . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1901 , however , following the discovery by james clerk maxwell that electric measurements could not be explained solely in terms of the three fundamental units of length , mass and time , giovanni gi ##org ##i proposed a new standard system that would include a fourth fundamental unit to measure quantities in electro ##ma ##gne ##tism . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1935 this was adopted by the iec as the " gi ##org ##i system " , now also known as mk ##s system , and in 1946 the ci ##pm approved a proposal to adopt the amp ##ere as the electromagnetic unit of the " mk ##sa system " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1948 the c ##gp ##m commissioned the ci ##pm " to make recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement , suitable for adoption by all countries ad ##hering to the metre convention " . [SEP]
[CLS] this led to the launch of si in 1960 and the subsequent publication of the " si bro ##chu ##re " , which stated that " it is not per ##missible to use abbreviation ##s for unit symbols or unit names . . . " . [SEP]
[CLS] the c ##gs and mk ##s systems co - existed during much of the early - to - mid 20th century , but as a result of the decision to adopt the " gi ##org ##i system " as the international system of units in 1960 , the ki ##logram is now the si base unit for mass , while the definition of the gram is derived from that of the ki ##logram . [SEP]
[CLS] the ki ##logram is a unit of mass . [SEP]
[CLS] mass is an " in ##ert ##ial " property ; that is , it is related to the tendency of an object at rest to remain at rest , or if in motion to remain in motion at a constant velocity , unless acted upon by a force . [SEP]
[CLS] while the weight of an object is dependent on the strength of the local gravitational field , the mass of an object is independent of gravity , as mass is a measure of the quantity of matter . [SEP]
[CLS] accordingly , for astronauts in micro ##gra ##vity , no effort is required to hold objects off the cabin floor ; they are " weight ##less " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , since objects in micro ##gra ##vity still retain their mass and in ##ert ##ia , an astronaut must ex ##ert ten times as much force to accelerate a 10 ##ki ##logram object at the same rate as a 1 ##ki ##logram object . [SEP]
[CLS] because at any given point on earth the weight of an object is proportional to its mass , the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard mass , whose mass is known in kilograms , using a device called a weighing scale . [SEP]
[CLS] the ratio of the force of gravity on the two objects , measured by the scale , is equal to the ratio of their masses . [SEP]
[CLS] the international committee for weights and measures ( ci ##pm ) approved a red ##ef ##ini ##tion of the si base units in november 2018 that defines the ki ##logram by defining the planck constant to be exactly , effectively defining the ki ##logram in terms of the second and the metre . [SEP]
[CLS] the new definition took effect on 20 may 2019 . [SEP]
[CLS] prior to the red ##ef ##ini ##tion , the ki ##logram and several other si units based on the ki ##logram were defined by a man - made metal arte ##fa ##ct : the " ki ##logram ##me des archives " from 1799 to 1889 , and the international prototype ki ##logram from 1889 onward . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1960 , the metre , previously similarly having been defined with reference to a single platinum - ir ##idium bar with two marks on it , was red ##efined in terms of an invariant physical constant ( the wavelength of a particular emission of light emitted by k ##ry ##pton , and later the speed of light ) so that the standard can be independently reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification . [SEP]
[CLS] at the 94 ##th meeting of the international committee for weights and measures ( ci ##pm ) in 2005 , it was recommended that the same be done with the ki ##logram . [SEP]
[CLS] in october 2010 , the ci ##pm voted to submit a resolution for consideration at the general conference on weights and measures ( c ##gp ##m ) , to " take note of an intention " that the ki ##logram be defined in terms of the planck constant , " h " ( which has dimensions of energy times time ) together with other physical constant ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] this resolution was accepted by the 24th conference of the c ##gp ##m in october 2011 and further discussed at the 25th conference in 2014 . [SEP]
[CLS] although the committee recognised that significant progress had been made , they concluded that the data did not yet appear sufficiently robust to adopt the revised definition , and that work should continue to enable the adoption at the 26th meeting , scheduled for 2018 . [SEP]
[CLS] such a definition would theoretically permit any apparatus that was capable of del ##ine ##ating the ki ##logram in terms of the planck constant to be used as long as it possessed sufficient precision , accuracy and stability . [SEP]
[CLS] the ki ##bble balance is one way to do this . [SEP]
[CLS] as part of this project , a variety of very different technologies and approaches were considered and explored over many years . [SEP]
[CLS] some of these approaches were based on equipment and procedures that would enable the rep ##rod ##ucible production of new , ki ##logram - mass prototypes on demand ( albeit with extraordinary effort ) using measurement techniques and material properties that are ultimately based on , or trace ##able to , physical constant ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] others were based on devices that measured either the acceleration or weight of hand - tuned ki ##logram test masses and which expressed their magnitude ##s in electrical terms via special components that permit trace ##ability to physical constant ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] all approaches depend on converting a weight measurement to a mass , and therefore require the precise measurement of the strength of gravity in laboratories . [SEP]
[CLS] all approaches would have precisely fixed one or more constant ##s of nature at a defined value . [SEP]
[CLS] because si prefix ##es may not be con ##cate ##nated ( serial ##ly linked ) within the name or symbol for a unit of measure , si prefix ##es are used with the unit " gram " , not " ki ##logram " , which already has a prefix as part of its name . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , one - million ##th of a ki ##logram is 1 ##mg ( one mill ##ig ##ram ) , not 1 ##μ ##k ##g ( one micro ##ki ##logram ) . [SEP]
