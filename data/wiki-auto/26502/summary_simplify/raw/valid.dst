With a career of several commercially successful works, beginning with "Urusei Yatsura" in 1978, Takahashi is one of Japan's most affluent manga artists.
Her works are popular worldwide, where they have been translated into a variety of languages, with over 200 million copies in circulation.
She has won the Shogakukan Manga Award twice, once in 1980 for "Urusei Yatsura" and again in 2001 for "Inuyasha", and the Seiun Award twice, once in 1987 for "Urusei Yatsura" and again in 1989 for "Mermaid Saga".
She also received the Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême in 2019, becoming the second woman and second Japanese to win the prize.
In an interview in 2000, Takahashi said that she had always wanted to become a professional comic author since she was a child.
During her university years, she enrolled in Gekiga Sonjuku, a manga school founded by Kazuo Koike, author of "Crying Freeman" and "Lone Wolf and Cub".
Under his guidance Takahashi began to publish her first "dōjinshi" creations in 1975, such as "Bye-Bye Road" and "Star of Futile Dust".
Her first published work was the one-shot "Katte na Yatsura" ("Those Selfish Aliens"), which garnered her an honorable mention at that year's Shogakukan New Comics Contest.
Later that same year, she began her first serialized story in "Weekly Shōnen Sunday"; "Urusei Yatsura", a comedic science fiction story.
During the run of the series, she shared a small apartment with two assistants, and often slept in a closet due to a lack of space.
During the same year, she published "Time Warp Trouble", "Shake Your Buddha", and the "Golden Gods of Poverty" in "Weekly Shōnen Sunday" magazine, which would remain the home to most of her major works for the next twenty years.
Written for an older audience, "Maison Ikkoku" is a romantic comedy, and Takahashi used her own experience living in an apartment complex to create the series.
Takahashi managed to work on the series on and off simultaneously with "Urusei Yatsura".
She concluded both series in 1987, with "Urusei Yatsura" ending at 34 volumes, and "Maison Ikkoku" at 15.
In 1984, during the writing of "Urusei Yatsura" and "Maison Ikkoku", Takahashi took a different approach to storytelling and began the dark, macabre "Mermaid Saga".
The series continued for nearly a decade until 1996, when it ended at 38 volumes.
"Ranma 1⁄2" and its anime adaption are cited as some of the first of their mediums to have become popular in the United States.
During the latter half of the 1990s, Rumiko Takahashi continued with short stories and her installments of "Mermaid Saga" and "One-Pound Gospel" until beginning her fourth major work, "Inuyasha".
Unlike the majority of her works, "Inuyasha" has a darker tone more akin to "Mermaid Saga" and, having been serialized in "Weekly Shōnen Sunday" from 1996 to 2008, is her longest to date.
On March 5, 2009, Rumiko Takahashi released her one-shot "Unmei No Tori".
On March 16, 2009, she collaborated with Mitsuru Adachi, creator of "Touch" and "Cross Game", to release a one-shot called "My Sweet Sunday".
This is Rumiko Takahashi's first new manga series since her previous manga series "Inuyasha" ended in June 2008.
Takahashi will start her new series "MAO" in the issue #23 of "Weekly Shōnen Sunday" on May 8, 2019.
Rumiko Takahashi started a new manga series entitled "MAO" in "Weekly Shōnen Sunday" issue #23 released on May 8, 2019.
This series first aired on Japanese television on October 14, and went through multiple director changes during its run.
Though the 195-episode TV series ended in March 1986, "Urusei Yatsura" was kept alive in anime form through OVA and movie releases through 1991.
AnimEigo has released the entire TV series and all of the OVAs and movies except for "Beautiful Dreamer" (which was released by Central Park Media in the U.S.) in the United States in English-subtitled format, with English dubs also made for the first two TV episodes (as "Those Obnoxious Aliens") and for all of the movies.
Kitty Films, the studio that produced "Urusei Yatsura" with animation assistance from Studio Pierrot and then Studio Deen, continued their cooperation and adapted Rumiko Takahashi's second work, "Maison Ikkoku" in 1986; it debuted the week after the final TV episode of "UY".
The TV series ended in 1992 amid internal turmoil within Kitty; Kitty and Studio Deen continued to produce "Ranma" OVAs until 1996.
The first anime ended before the manga did, thus wrapping up inconclusively.
However, a second Inuyasha anime series called "Inuyasha the Final Act" debuted in Japan in the fall of 2009 and ended in March 2010, finishing the series.
The year 2008 marked the 50th anniversary of "Weekly Shōnen Sunday" and the 30th anniversary of the first publication of "Urusei Yatsura", and Rumiko Takahashi's manga work was honoured in "It's a Rumic World", a special exhibition held from July 30 to August 11 at the Matsuya Ginza department store in Tokyo.
Several new pieces of animation accompanied the exhibit, including new half-hour "Ranma 1⁄2" and "Inuyasha" ("Black Tetsusaiga") OVAs and an introductory sequence featuring characters from "Urusei Yatsura", "Ranma" and "Inuyasha" (starring the characters' original anime voice talents), which has become a popular video on YouTube.
The "It's a Rumic World" exhibit was scheduled to re-open in Sendai in December 2008, at which time a new half-hour "Urusei Yatsura" OVA was scheduled to premiere.
A special DVD release containing all three new OVAs was announced as coming out on January 29, 2010, with a trailer posted in September 2009.
"Rumiko Takahashi Anthology", animated by TMS Entertainment adapts many of her short stories from the 80s.
Also, a TV series of "Mermaid Saga" was produced in 2003, animating 8 of her stories.
Many of Takahashi's works have been translated into English, as well as other European languages.
When I see an American comedy, even though the jokes are translated, there's always a moment when I feel puzzled and think, 'Ah, Americans would probably laugh at this more'.
I feel confident that there's enough substance to them that people from a variety of cultural backgrounds can have a lot of fun reading them."
Artists that have cited Takahashi and her work as an influence include Canadian Bryan Lee O'Malley on his series "Scott Pilgrim", American Colleen Coover on her erotic series "Small Favors", Japanese Chihiro Tamaki on her manga "Walkin' Butterfly", Chinese-Australian Queenie Chan, and Thai Wisut Ponnimit.
Matt Bozon, creator of the "Shantae" video game series, cited "Ranma 1⁄2" as a big influence on his work.
In 2016, ComicsAlliance listed Takahashi as one of twelve women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition, stating that "Any one of her projects would be the career highlight of another talent."
In July 2018, Takahashi was inducted into the Eisner Hall of Fame.
In January 2019, Takahashi won the Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême, becoming the second woman and second manga artist to win the award at the Angoulême International Comics Festival.
