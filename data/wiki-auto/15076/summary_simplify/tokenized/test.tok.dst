[CLS] in crypt ##ography , the international data encryption algorithm ( idea ) , originally called improved proposed encryption standard ( ip ##es ) , is a symmetric - key block cipher designed by james massey of et ##h zurich and xu ##ej ##ia lai and was first described in 1991 . [SEP]
[CLS] the algorithm was intended as a replacement for the data encryption standard ( des ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the cipher was patented in a number of countries but was freely available for non - commercial use . [SEP]
[CLS] the last patents expired in 2012 , and idea is now patent - free and thus completely free for all uses . [SEP]
[CLS] idea was used in pretty good privacy ( pg ##p ) v ##2 . 0 and was incorporated after the original cipher used in v ##1 . 0 , bass ##oma ##tic , was found to be ins ##ecure . [SEP]
[CLS] idea operates on 64 - bit blocks using a 128 - bit key and consists of a series of 8 identical transformations ( a " round " , see the illustration ) and an output transformation ( the " half - round " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] idea derives much of its security by inter ##lea ##ving operations from different groups — modular addition and multiplication , and bit ##wise exclusive or ( x ##or ) — which are algebraic ##ally " incompatible " in some sense . [SEP]
[CLS] to work with 16 - bit words ( meaning 4 inputs instead of 2 for the 64 - bit block size ) , idea uses the lai – massey scheme twice in parallel , with the two parallel round functions being inter ##wo ##ven with each other . [SEP]
[CLS] the first 8 sub - keys are extracted directly from the key , with k ##1 from the first round being the lower 16 bits ; further groups of 8 keys are created by rotating the main key left 25 bits between each group of 8 . [SEP]
[CLS] this means that it is rotated less than once per round , on average , for a total of 6 rotation ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] dec ##ry ##ption works like encryption , but the order of the round keys is inverted , and the sub ##key ##s for the odd rounds are inverse ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , the values of sub ##key ##s k ##1 – k ##4 are replaced by the inverse of k ##49 – k ##52 for the respective group operation , k ##5 and k ##6 of each group should be replaced by k ##47 and k ##48 for dec ##ry ##ption . [SEP]
[CLS] the designers anal ##yse ##d idea to measure its strength against differential crypt ##analysis and concluded that it is immune under certain assumptions . [SEP]
[CLS] s of 2007 , the best attack applied to all keys could break idea reduced to 6 rounds ( the full idea cipher uses 8 . 5 rounds ) . [SEP]
[CLS] note that a " break " is any attack that requires less than 2 operations ; the 6 - round attack requires 2 known plain ##text ##s and 2 operations . [SEP]
[CLS] however , by 1999 he was no longer recommend ##ing idea due to the availability of faster algorithms , some progress in its crypt ##analysis , and the issue of patents . [SEP]
[CLS] independently in 2012 , full 8 . 5 - round idea was broken using a narrow - bi ##cl ##iques attack , with a reduction of crypt ##ographic strength of about 2 bits , similar to the effect of the previous bi ##cl ##iques attack on ae ##s ; however , this attack does not threaten the security of idea in practice . [SEP]
[CLS] the very simple key schedule makes idea subject to a class of weak keys ; some keys containing a large number of 0 bits produce weak encryption . [SEP]
[CLS] these are of little concern in practice , being sufficiently rare that they are unnecessary to avoid explicitly when generating keys randomly . [SEP]
[CLS] this is still of ne ##gli ##gible probability to be a concern to a randomly chosen key , and some of the problems are fixed by the constant x ##or proposed earlier , but the paper is not certain if all of them are . [SEP]
[CLS] media ##cr ##yp ##t ag is now offering a successor to idea and focuses on its new cipher ( official release on may 2005 ) idea n ##xt , which was previously called fox . [SEP]
