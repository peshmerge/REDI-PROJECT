[CLS] the geologic time scale ( gt ##s ) is a system of chronological dating that relates geological strata ( st ##rat ##igraphy ) to time . [SEP]
[CLS] it is used by geologist ##s , pale ##ont ##ologists , and other earth scientists to describe the timing and relationships of events that have occurred during earth ' s history . [SEP]
[CLS] the table of geologic time spans , presented here , agree with the nomenclature , dates and standard color codes set forth by the international commission on st ##rat ##igraphy ( ic ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary defined divisions of time are e ##ons , in sequence the had ##ean , the arch ##ean , the pro ##ter ##oz ##oic and the ph ##ane ##ro ##zo ##ic . [SEP]
[CLS] the first three of these can be referred to collectively as the pre ##cam ##bria ##n super ##eon . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##ons are divided into eras , which are in turn divided into periods , epoch ##s and ages . [SEP]
[CLS] the following four timeline ##s show the geologic time scale . [SEP]
[CLS] the first shows the entire time from the formation of the earth to the present , but this gives little space for the most recent e ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , the second timeline shows an expanded view of the most recent e ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] in a similar way , the most recent era is expanded in the third timeline , and the most recent period is expanded in the fourth timeline . [SEP]
[CLS] corresponding to e ##ons , eras , periods , epoch ##s and ages , the terms " [ e ##ono ##the ##m ] " , " [ era ##the ##m ] " , " [ system ( st ##rat ##igraphy ) | system ] " , " [ series ( st ##rat ##igraphy ) | series ] " , " [ stage ( st ##rat ##igraphy ) | stage ] " are used to refer to the layers of rock that belong to these stretches of geologic time in earth ' s history . [SEP]
[CLS] geologist ##s qualify these units as " early " , " mid " , and " late " when referring to time , and " lower " , " middle " , and " upper " when referring to the corresponding rocks . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the lower jurassic series in [ ch ##ron ##ost ##rat ##igraphy ] corresponds to the early jurassic epoch in [ geo ##ch ##ron ##ology ] . [SEP]
[CLS] the adjective ##s are capital ##ized when the subdivision is formally recognized , and lower case when not ; thus " early miocene " but " early jurassic . " [SEP]
[CLS] evidence from [ radio ##metric dating ] indicates that earth is about [ age of the earth | 4 . 54 billion years old ] . [SEP]
[CLS] the geology or " [ deep time ] " of earth ' s past has been organized into various units according to events which took place . [SEP]
[CLS] different spans of time on the gt ##s are usually marked by corresponding [ st ##rat ##igraphy | changes in the composition of strata ] which indicate major geological or [ pale ##ont ##ology | pale ##ont ##ological ] events , such as [ mass extinction ] s . for example , the boundary between the [ cretaceous ] period and the [ pale ##ogen ##e ] period is defined by the [ cretaceous â€“ pale ##ogen ##e extinction event ] , which marked the demise of the non - av ##ian [ dinosaur ] s and many other groups of life . [SEP]
[CLS] older time spans , which pre ##date the reliable fossil record ( before the [ pro ##ter ##oz ##oic e ##on ] ) , are defined by their absolute age . [SEP]
[CLS] geologic units from the same time but different parts of the world often look different and contain different fossils , so the same time - span was historically given different names in different local ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in north america , the lower [ cambrian ] is called the wa ##uc ##ob ##an series that is then subdivided into zones based on succession of [ tri ##lo ##bit ##a | tri ##lo ##bit ##es ] . [SEP]
[CLS] in [ east asia ] and [ siberia ] , the same unit is split into [ alexia ##n ] , [ at ##da ##ban ##ian ] , and [ bot ##omi ##an ] stages . [SEP]
[CLS] a key aspect of the work of the international commission on st ##rat ##igraphy is to reconcile this conflicting terminology and define universal [ horizon ( geology ) | horizons ] that can be used around the world . [SEP]
[CLS] some other [ planet # solar system | planets ] and [ natural satellite | moons ] in the solar system have sufficiently rigid structures to have preserved records of their own histories , for example , [ geology of venus | venus ] , [ geology of mars | mars ] and the [ geology of the moon | earth ' s moon ] . [SEP]
[CLS] dominant ##ly fluid planets , such as the [ gas giant ] s , do not preserve their history in a comparable manner . [SEP]
[CLS] apart from the [ late heavy bombardment ] , events on other planets probably had little direct influence on the earth , and events on earth had corresponding ##ly little effect on those planets . [SEP]
[CLS] construction of a time scale that links the planets is , therefore , of only limited relevance to the earth ' s time scale , except in a solar system context . [SEP]
[CLS] the existence , timing , and terrestrial effects of the late heavy bombardment are still a matter of debate . [SEP]
