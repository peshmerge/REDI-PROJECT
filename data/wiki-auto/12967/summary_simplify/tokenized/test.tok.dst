[CLS] it is used by geologist ##s , pale ##ont ##ologists , and other earth scientists to describe the timing and relationships of events that have occurred during earth ' s history . [SEP]
[CLS] the table of geologic time spans , presented here , agree with the nomenclature , dates and standard color codes set forth by the international commission on st ##rat ##igraphy ( ic ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] e ##ons are divided into eras , which are in turn divided into periods , epoch ##s and ages . [SEP]
[CLS] the first shows the entire time from the formation of the earth to the present , but this gives little space for the most recent e ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] in a similar way , the most recent era is expanded in the third timeline , and the most recent period is expanded in the fourth timeline . [SEP]
[CLS] the adjective ##s are capital ##ized when the subdivision is formally recognized , and lower case when not ; thus " early miocene " but " early jurassic . " [SEP]
[CLS] evidence from [ radio ##metric dating ] indicates that earth is about [ age of the earth | 4 . 54 billion years old ] . [SEP]
[CLS] the geology or " [ deep time ] " of earth ' s past has been organized into various units according to events which took place . [SEP]
[CLS] different spans of time on the gt ##s are usually marked by corresponding [ st ##rat ##igraphy | changes in the composition of strata ] which indicate major geological or [ pale ##ont ##ology | pale ##ont ##ological ] events , such as [ mass extinction ] s . for example , the boundary between the [ cretaceous ] period and the [ pale ##ogen ##e ] period is defined by the [ cretaceous â€“ pale ##ogen ##e extinction event ] , which marked the demise of the non - av ##ian [ dinosaur ] s and many other groups of life . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in north america , the lower [ cambrian ] is called the wa ##uc ##ob ##an series that is then subdivided into zones based on succession of [ tri ##lo ##bit ##a | tri ##lo ##bit ##es ] . [SEP]
[CLS] a key aspect of the work of the international commission on st ##rat ##igraphy is to reconcile this conflicting terminology and define universal [ horizon ( geology ) | horizons ] that can be used around the world . [SEP]
[CLS] some other [ planet # solar system | planets ] and [ natural satellite | moons ] in the solar system have sufficiently rigid structures to have preserved records of their own histories , for example , [ geology of venus | venus ] , [ geology of mars | mars ] and the [ geology of the moon | earth ' s moon ] . [SEP]
[CLS] dominant ##ly fluid planets , such as the [ gas giant ] s , do not preserve their history in a comparable manner . [SEP]
[CLS] apart from the [ late heavy bombardment ] , events on other planets probably had little direct influence on the earth , and events on earth had corresponding ##ly little effect on those planets . [SEP]
[CLS] construction of a time scale that links the planets is , therefore , of only limited relevance to the earth ' s time scale , except in a solar system context . [SEP]
