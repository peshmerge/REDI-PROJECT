[CLS] the six - bit character code was an often used implementation in early encoding systems and computers using six - bit and nine - bit bytes were common in the 1960s . [SEP]
[CLS] in this era , bit grouping ##s in the instruction stream were often referred to as " syllables " , before the term " byte " became common . [SEP]
[CLS] the modern " de facto " standard of eight bits , as documented in iso / iec 238 ##2 - 1 : 1993 , is a convenient power of two permitting the binary - encoded values 0 through 255 for one byte â€” 2 to the power 8 is 256 . [SEP]
[CLS] many types of applications use information represent ##able in eight or fewer bits and processor designers opt ##imi ##ze for this common usage . [SEP]
[CLS] the unit symbol for the byte was designated as the upper - case letter " b " by the international electro ##tech ##nical commission ( iec ) and institute of electrical and electronics engineers ( ieee ) in contrast to the bit , whose ieee symbol is a lower - case " b " . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " byte " was coined by werner bu ##ch ##holz in june 1956 , during the early design phase for the ibm stretch computer , which had addressing to the bit and variable field length ( vfl ) instructions with a byte size encoded in the instruction . [SEP]
[CLS] another origin of " byte " for bit groups smaller than a computers ' s word size , and in particular groups of four bits , is on record by louis g . doo ##ley , who claimed he coined the term while working with jules schwartz and dick bee ##ler on an air defense system called sage at mit lincoln laboratory in 1956 or 1957 , which was jointly developed by rand , mit , and ibm . [SEP]
[CLS] early computers used a variety of four - bit binary - coded decimal ( bc ##d ) representations and the six - bit codes for print ##able graphic patterns common in the u . s . army ( field ##ata ) and navy . [SEP]
[CLS] these sets were expanded in 1963 to seven bits of coding , called the american standard code for information interchange ( as ##ci ##i ) as the federal information processing standard , which replaced the incompatible tel ##ep ##rin ##ter codes in use by different branches of the u . s . government and universities during the 1960s . [SEP]
[CLS] as ##ci ##i included the distinction of upper - and lower ##case alphabet ##s and a set of control characters to facilitate the transmission of written language as well as printing device functions , such as page advance and line feed , and the physical or logical control of data flow over the transmission media . [SEP]
[CLS] during the early 1960s , while also active in as ##ci ##i standardization , ibm simultaneously introduced in its product line of system / 360 the eight - bit extended binary coded decimal interchange code ( e ##bc ##dic ) , an expansion of their six - bit binary - coded decimal ( bc ##dic ) representations used in earlier card punches . [SEP]
[CLS] the prominence of the system / 360 led to the ubiquitous adoption of the eight - bit storage size , while in detail the e ##bc ##dic and as ##ci ##i encoding schemes are different . [SEP]
[CLS] this large investment promised to reduce transmission costs for eight - bit data . [SEP]
[CLS] micro ##pro ##ces ##sor ##s such as the intel 800 ##8 , the direct predecessor of the 80 ##80 and the 80 ##86 , used in early personal computers , could also perform a small number of operations on the four - bit pairs in a byte , such as the decimal - add - adjust ( da ##a ) instruction . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , the term " oct ##ad " or " oct ##ade " was used to denote eight bits as well at least in western europe ; however , this usage is no longer common . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , ieee 154 ##1 specifies the lower case character " b " as the symbol for the bit , but iec 800 ##00 - 13 and metric - interchange - format specify the symbol as " bit " , providing di ##sam ##bi ##gua ##tion from b for byte . [SEP]
[CLS] in the international system of quantities ( is ##q ) , b is the symbol of the " bel " , a unit of log ##ari ##th ##mic power ratios named after alexander graham bell , creating a conflict with the iec specification . [SEP]
[CLS] however , little danger of confusion exists , because the bel is a rarely used unit . [SEP]
[CLS] it is used primarily in its dec ##adi ##c fraction , the dec ##ibe ##l ( db ) , for signal strength and sound pressure level measurements , while a unit for one tenth of a byte , the dec ##ib ##yte , and other fraction ##s , are only used in derived units , such as transmission rates . [SEP]
[CLS] the lower ##case letter o for oct ##et is defined as the symbol for oct ##et in iec 800 ##00 - 13 and is commonly used in languages such as french and romanian , and is also combined with metric prefix ##es for multiple ##s , for example ko and mo . [SEP]
[CLS] the usage of the term " oct ##ad ( e ) " for eight bits is no longer common . [SEP]
[CLS] despite standardization efforts , ambiguity still exists in the meanings of the si ( or metric ) prefix ##es used with the unit byte , especially concerning the prefix ##es " ki ##lo " ( k or k ) , " mega " ( m ) , and " gig ##a " ( g ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in some fields of the software and computer hardware industries a binary prefix is used for bytes and bits , while producers of computer storage devices practice adherence to decimal si multiple ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] while the numerical difference between the decimal and binary interpretations is relatively small for the prefix ##es ki ##lo and mega , it grows to over 20 % for prefix yo ##tta . [SEP]
[CLS] the c and c + + programming languages define " byte " as an " " address ##able unit of data storage large enough to hold any member of the basic character set of the execution environment " " ( clause 3 . 6 of the c standard ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the c standard requires that the integral data type " unsigned char " must hold at least 256 different values , and is represented by at least eight bits ( clause 5 . 2 . 4 . 2 . 1 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , the c and c + + standards require that there are no " gaps " between two bytes . [SEP]
[CLS] in data transmission systems , the byte is defined as a contiguous sequence of bits in a serial data stream representing the smallest distinguished unit of data . [SEP]
