[CLS] the great rift valley is a series of contiguous geographic trenches , approximately 6000 km in total length , that runs from the be ##qa ##a valley in lebanon in asia to mozambique in southeastern africa . [SEP]
[CLS] while the name continues in some usage ##s , it is rarely used in geology as it is considered an imp ##re ##cise merging of separate though related rift and fault systems . [SEP]
[CLS] today , the term is most often used to refer to the valley of the east african rift , the diver ##gent plate boundary which extends from the afar triple junction southward across eastern africa , and is in the process of splitting the african plate into two new separate plates . [SEP]
[CLS] geologist ##s generally refer to these inc ##ip ##ient plates as the nu ##bian plate and the somali plate . [SEP]
[CLS] today these rift ##s and faults are seen as distinct , although connected , but originally , the great rift valley was thought to be a single feature that extended from lebanon in the north to mozambique in the south , where it constitutes one of two distinct ph ##ys ##io ##graphic provinces of the east african mountains . [SEP]
[CLS] it included what today is called the lebanese section of the dead sea transform , the jordan rift valley , red sea rift and the east african rift . [SEP]
[CLS] these rift ##s and faults were formed 35 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] the northernmost part of the rift corresponds to the central section of what is called today the dead sea transform ( ds ##t ) or rift . [SEP]
[CLS] this mid ##section of the ds ##t forms the be ##qa ##a valley in lebanon , separating the lebanon from the anti - lebanon mountains . [SEP]
[CLS] further south it is known as the hu ##la valley separating the galilee mountains and the go ##lan heights . [SEP]
[CLS] the jordan river begins here and flows southward through lake hu ##la into the sea of galilee in israel . [SEP]
[CLS] the rift then continues south through the jordan rift valley into the dead sea on the israeli - jordanian border . [SEP]
[CLS] from the dead sea southward ##s , the rift is occupied by the wadi arab ##ah , then the gulf of a ##qa ##ba , and then the red sea . [SEP]
[CLS] off the southern tip of sinai in the red sea , the dead sea transform meets the red sea rift which runs the length of the red sea . [SEP]
[CLS] the red sea rift comes ashore to meet the east african rift and the aden ridge in the afar depression of east africa . [SEP]
[CLS] the junction of these three rift ##s is called the afar triple junction . [SEP]
[CLS] the east african rift has two branches , the western rift valley and the eastern rift valley . [SEP]
[CLS] the western rift , also called the albert ##ine rift , is bordered by some of the highest mountains in africa , including the vi ##run ##ga mountains , mit ##umb ##a mountains , and ru ##wen ##zo ##ri range . [SEP]
[CLS] it contains the rift valley lakes , which include some of the deepest lakes in the world ( up to 147 ##0 m deep at lake tang ##any ##ika ) . [SEP]
[CLS] much of this area lies within the boundaries of national parks such as vi ##run ##ga national park in the democratic republic of congo , r ##wen ##zo ##ri national park and queen elizabeth national park in uganda , and volcanoes national park in rwanda . [SEP]
[CLS] lake victoria is considered to be part of the rift valley system although it actually lies between the two branches . [SEP]
[CLS] all of the african great lakes were formed as the result of the rift , and most lie within its rift valley . [SEP]
[CLS] in kenya , the valley is deepest to the north of nairobi . [SEP]
[CLS] as the lakes in the eastern rift have no outlet to the sea and tend to be shallow , they have a high mineral content as the eva ##por ##ation of water leaves the salts behind . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , lake mag ##adi has high concentrations of soda ( sodium carbonate ) and lake elm ##ente ##ita , lake bog ##oria , and lake nak ##uru are all strongly al ##kali ##ne , while the freshwater springs supplying lake na ##iva ##sha are essential to support its current biological variety . [SEP]
[CLS] the southern section of the rift valley includes lake malawi , the third - deepest freshwater body in the world , reaching 70 ##6 m in depth and separating the ny ##ass ##a plateau of northern mozambique from malawi ; it ends in the za ##mbe ##zi valley . [SEP]
