The Great Rift Valley is a series of contiguous geographic trenches, approximately 6000 km in total length, that runs from the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon in Asia to Mozambique in southeastern Africa.
While the name continues in some usages, it is rarely used in geology as it is considered an imprecise merging of separate though related rift and fault systems.
Today, the term is most often used to refer to the valley of the East African Rift, the divergent plate boundary which extends from the Afar Triple Junction southward across eastern Africa, and is in the process of splitting the African Plate into two new separate plates.
Today these rifts and faults are seen as distinct, although connected, but originally, the Great Rift Valley was thought to be a single feature that extended from Lebanon in the north to Mozambique in the south, where it constitutes one of two distinct physiographic provinces of the East African mountains.
It included what today is called the Lebanese section of the Dead Sea Transform, the Jordan Rift Valley, Red Sea Rift and the East African Rift.
The Jordan River begins here and flows southward through Lake Hula into the Sea of Galilee in Israel.
The Rift then continues south through the Jordan Rift Valley into the Dead Sea on the Israeli-Jordanian border.
Off the southern tip of Sinai in the Red Sea, the Dead Sea Transform meets the Red Sea Rift which runs the length of the Red Sea.
The junction of these three rifts is called the Afar Triple Junction.
The East African rift has two branches, the Western Rift Valley and the Eastern Rift Valley.
Lake Victoria is considered to be part of the rift valley system although it actually lies between the two branches.
In Kenya, the valley is deepest to the north of Nairobi.
As the lakes in the Eastern Rift have no outlet to the sea and tend to be shallow, they have a high mineral content as the evaporation of water leaves the salts behind.
The southern section of the Rift Valley includes Lake Malawi, the third-deepest freshwater body in the world, reaching 706 m in depth and separating the Nyassa plateau of Northern Mozambique from Malawi; it ends in the Zambezi valley.
