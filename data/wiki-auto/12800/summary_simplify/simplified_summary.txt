the great rift valley is a series of contiguous geographic trenches .
while the name continues in some usages , it is rarely used in geology .
today , the term is most often used to refer to the valley of the east african rift .
today these rifts and faults are seen as distinct , although connected , but originally , the great rift valley was thought to be a single feature that extended from lebanon in the north to mozambique in the south .
it includes what today is called the lebanese section of the dead sea transform , the jordan rift valley , red sea rift and the east african rift .
the jordan river begins here .
the rift then continues south through the jordan rift valley into the dead sea on the israeli-jordanian border .
off sinai in the red sea , the sea becomes the red sea rift .
the junction of these three rifts is called the afar triple junction .
the rift valley is divided into two branches : the western rift valley and the eastern rift valley .
it is between the two branches .
in kenya , the valley is deepest to the north of nairobi .
they have a high mineral content as the evaporation of water leaves the salts behind .
the southern section of the rift valley includes lake malawi , the third deepest freshwater body in the world , reaching 706 m in depth and separating the nyassa plateau of northern mozambique from malawi .
