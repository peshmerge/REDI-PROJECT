[CLS] schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal behavior , strange speech , and a decreased ability to understand reality . [SEP]
[CLS] other symptoms may include false beliefs , unclear or confused thinking , hearing voices that do not exist , reduced social engagement and emotional expression , and lack of motivation . [SEP]
[CLS] people with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety , depression , or substance - use disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia does not imply a " split personality " or di ##sso ##cia ##tive identity disorder , conditions with which it is often confused in public perception . [SEP]
[CLS] in more serious situations where there is risk to self or others , involuntary hospital ##ization may be necessary , although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were . [SEP]
[CLS] the average life expect ##ancy of people with the disorder is 10 – 25 years less than that of the general population . [SEP]
[CLS] people with schizophrenia may experience hall ##uc ##inations ( most reported are hearing voices ) , del ##usions ( often bizarre or per ##se ##cut ##ory in nature ) , and di ##sor ##gan ##ized thinking and speech . [SEP]
[CLS] distortion ##s of self - experience such as feeling as if one ' s thoughts or feelings are not really one ' s own to believing thoughts are being inserted into one ' s mind , sometimes termed pass ##ivity phenomena , are also common . [SEP]
[CLS] in one uncommon sub ##type , the person may be largely mute , remain motionless in bizarre posture ##s , or exhibit purpose ##less agitation , all signs of cat ##aton ##ia . [SEP]
[CLS] it is unclear if the phenomenon called " thought blocking " , where a talking person suddenly becomes silent for a few seconds to minutes , occurs in schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] about 30 to 50 percent of people with schizophrenia fail to accept that they have an illness or comply with their recommended treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] people with schizophrenia may have a high rate of ir ##rita ##ble bow ##el syndrome , but they often do not mention it unless specifically asked . [SEP]
[CLS] psycho ##genic poly ##di ##ps ##ia , or excessive fluid intake in the absence of physiological reasons to drink , is relatively common in people with schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia is often described in terms of positive and negative ( or deficit ) symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] " negative symptoms " are deficit ##s of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes , and are less responsive to medication . [SEP]
[CLS] they commonly include flat expressions or little emotion , poverty of speech , inability to experience pleasure , lack of desire to form relationships , and lack of motivation . [SEP]
[CLS] negative symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life , functional ability , and the burden on others than positive symptoms do . [SEP]
[CLS] people with greater negative symptoms often have a history of poor adjustment before the onset of illness , and response to medication is often limited . [SEP]
[CLS] the validity of the positive and negative construct has been challenged by factor analysis studies observing a three dimension grouping of symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] deficit ##s in cognitive abilities are widely recognized as a core feature of schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] the extent of the cognitive deficit ##s someone experiences is a predict ##or of how functional they will be , the quality of occupational performance , and how successful they will be in maintaining treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in people with schizophrenia has been reported to be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] deficit ##s in verbal memory are the most pronounced in someone with schizophrenia , and are not accounted for by deficit in attention . [SEP]
[CLS] verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in those with schizophrenia to semantic ##ally en ##code ( process information relating to meaning ) , which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long - term memory . [SEP]
[CLS] when given a list of words , healthy people remember positive words more frequently ( known as the polly ##anna principle ) , but people with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their con ##not ##ations , suggesting that the experience of an ##hed ##onia imp ##air ##s the semantic encoding of the words . [SEP]
[CLS] first - degree family members of those with schizophrenia and other high - risk people also show a degree of deficit in cognitive abilities , and specifically in working memory . [SEP]
[CLS] a review of the literature on cognitive deficit ##s in people with schizophrenia shows that the deficit ##s may be present in early adolescence , or as early as childhood . [SEP]
[CLS] the deficit ##s which a person with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients , or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables . [SEP]
[CLS] although the evidence that cognitive deficit ##s remain stable over time is reliable and abundant , much of the research in this domain focuses on methods to improve attention and working memory . [SEP]
[CLS] efforts to improve learning ability in people with schizophrenia using a high - versus low - reward condition and an instruction - absent or instruction - present condition revealed that increasing reward leads to poorer performance while providing instruction leads to improved performance , highlighting that some treatments may exist to increase cognitive performance . [SEP]
[CLS] this type of training , known as self - instructional ( si ) training , produced benefits such as lower number of nonsense verbal ##izations and improved recall when distracted . [SEP]
[CLS] late adolescence and early adulthood are peak periods for the onset of schizophrenia , critical years in a young adult ' s social and vocational development . [SEP]
[CLS] to minimize the developmental disruption associated with schizophrenia , much work has recently been done to identify and treat the pro ##dro ##mal ( pre - onset ) phase of the disorder , which has been detected up to 30 months before the onset of symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] those who go on to develop schizophrenia may experience transient or self - limiting psychotic symptoms and the non - specific symptoms of social withdrawal , ir ##rita ##bility , d ##ys ##ph ##oria , and cl ##ums ##iness before the onset of the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] children who go on to develop schizophrenia may also demonstrate decreased intelligence , decreased motor development ( reaching milestone ##s such as walking slowly ) , isolated play preference , social anxiety , and poor school performance . [SEP]
[CLS] a combination of genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] people with a family history of schizophrenia who have a transient psycho ##sis have a 20 – 40 % chance of being diagnosed one year later . [SEP]
[CLS] estimates of the her ##ita ##bility of schizophrenia are around 80 % , which implies that 80 % of the individual differences in risk to schizophrenia is associated with genetics . [SEP]
[CLS] the greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first - degree relative with the disease ( risk is 6 . 5 % ) ; more than 40 % of mono ##zy ##go ##tic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected . [SEP]
[CLS] results of candidate gene studies of schizophrenia have generally failed to find consistent associations , and the genetic lo ##ci identified by genome - wide association studies as associated with schizophrenia explain only a small fraction of the variation in the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] the sum ##mation of these effect sizes into a poly ##genic risk score can explain at least 7 % of the variability in liability for schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] these rare cn ##vs increase the risk of someone developing the disorder by as much as 20 - fold , and are frequently como ##rb ##id with autism and intellectual disabilities . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , an inverse genetic correlation with intelligence and no genetic correlation with immune disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] the question of how schizophrenia could be primarily genetically influenced , given that people with schizophrenia have lower fertility rates , is a paradox . [SEP]
[CLS] it is expected that genetic variants that increase the risk of schizophrenia would be selected against due to their negative effects on reproductive fitness . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of potential explanations have been proposed , including that all ##eles associated with schizophrenia risk con ##fers a fitness advantage in unaffected individuals . [SEP]
[CLS] while some evidence has not supported this idea , others propose that a large number of all ##eles each contributing a small amount can persist . [SEP]
[CLS] environmental factors associated with the development of schizophrenia include the living environment , drug use , and pre ##nat ##al stress ##ors . [SEP]
[CLS] maternal stress has been associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia , possibly in association with reel ##in . [SEP]
[CLS] maternal nutritional def ##iciencies , such as those observed during a famine , as well as maternal obesity have also been identified as possible risk factors for schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] both maternal stress and infection have been demonstrated to alter fetal ne ##uro ##dev ##elo ##pment through pro - inflammatory proteins such as il - 8 and tn ##f . [SEP]
[CLS] parenting style seems to have no major effect , although people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents . [SEP]
[CLS] childhood trauma , death of a parent , and being bull ##ied or abused increase the risk of psycho ##sis . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized that in some people , development of schizophrenia is related to int ##estinal tract dysfunction such as seen with non - celia ##c g ##lu ##ten sensitivity or abnormalities in the int ##estinal flora . [SEP]
[CLS] a subgroup of persons with schizophrenia present an immune response to g ##lu ##ten different from that found in people with celia ##c , with elevated levels of certain serum bio ##mark ##ers of g ##lu ##ten sensitivity such as anti - g ##lia ##din i ##gg or anti - g ##lia ##din i ##ga antibodies . [SEP]
[CLS] amp ##het ##amine , cocaine , and to a lesser extent alcohol , can result in a transient st ##im ##ula ##nt psycho ##sis or alcohol - related psycho ##sis that presents very similarly to schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] although it is not generally believed to be a cause of the illness , people with schizophrenia use nico ##tine at much higher rates than the general population . [SEP]
[CLS] alcohol use is not associated with an earlier onset of psycho ##sis . [SEP]
[CLS] cannabis may be a contributor ##y factor in schizophrenia , potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk . [SEP]
[CLS] the increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual . [SEP]
[CLS] other drugs may be used only as coping mechanisms by people who have schizophrenia , to deal with depression , anxiety , boredom , and loneliness . [SEP]
[CLS] factors such as h ##yp ##ox ##ia and infection , or stress and mal ##nut ##rit ##ion in the mother during fetal development , may result in a slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life . [SEP]
[CLS] people diagnosed with schizophrenia are more likely to have been born in winter or spring ( at least in the northern hemisphere ) , which may be a result of increased rates of viral exposure ##s in ut ##ero . [SEP]
[CLS] while the mechanism of schizophrenia is unknown , a number of attempts have been made to explain the link between altered brain function and schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the most common is the do ##pa ##mine hypothesis , which attributes psycho ##sis to the mind ' s faulty interpretation of the mis ##fi ##ring of do ##pa ##mine ##rg ##ic neurons . [SEP]
[CLS] abnormal do ##pa ##mine signalling has been implicated in schizophrenia based on the useful ##ness of medications that effect the do ##pa ##mine receptor and the observation that do ##pa ##mine levels are increased during acute psycho ##sis . [SEP]
[CLS] studies demonstrate reduced nm ##da receptor expression and nm ##da receptor block ##ers mimic both schizophrenia symptoms and the physiological abnormalities associated with schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] post - mort ##em studies consistently find that a subset of these neurons fail to express ga ##d ##6 ##7 , in addition to abnormalities in morphology . [SEP]
[CLS] the subset ##s of intern ##eur ##ons that are abnormal in schizophrenia are responsible for the sync ##hr ##oni ##zing of neural ensembles that is necessary during working memory tasks , a process that is electro ##phy ##sio ##logical ##ly reflected in gamma frequency ( 30 – 80 hz ) os ##ci ##llation ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] before the onset of schizophrenia there is often impairment ##s in cognition , social functioning , and motor skills . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia usually emerges 18 - 25 , an age period that overlap ##s with certain stages of ne ##uro ##dev ##elo ##pment that are implicated in schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] although these functions are di ##sso ##cia ##ble , their dysfunction in schizophrenia may reflect an underlying deficit in the ability to represent goal related information in working memory , and to utilize this to direct cognition and behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] these abnormalities may be linked to the consistent post - mort ##em finding of reduced ne ##uro ##pi ##l , evidenced by increased pyramid ##al cell density and reduced dent ##rit ##ic spine density . [SEP]
[CLS] these cellular and functional abnormalities may also be reflected in structural ne ##uro ##ima ##ging studies that find reduced grey matter volume in association with deficit ##s in working memory tasks . [SEP]
[CLS] positive and negative symptoms have been linked to reduced co ##rti ##cal thickness in the superior temporal lobe , and orbit ##of ##ron ##tal cortex , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a large body of evidence suggests that he ##don ##ic responses are intact in schizophrenia , and that what is reported to be an ##hed ##onia is a reflection of dysfunction in other processes related to reward . [SEP]
[CLS] overall , a failure of online maintenance and reward ass ##oc ##ia ##tiv ##ity is thought to lead to impairment in the generation of cognition and behavior required to obtain rewards , despite normal he ##don ##ic responses . [SEP]
[CLS] both hall ##uc ##inations and del ##usions have been suggested to reflect improper encoding of prior expectations , thereby causing expectation to excessive ##ly influence sensory perception and the formation of beliefs . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the american psychiatric association ' s ( ap ##a ) fifth edition of the " diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders " ( ds ##m 5 ) or the world health organization ' s international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems ( ic ##d - 10 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these criteria use the self - reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior , followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional . [SEP]
[CLS] symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment before a diagnosis is made . [SEP]
[CLS] the person had to be suffering from del ##usions , hall ##uc ##inations , or di ##sor ##gan ##ized speech . [SEP]
[CLS] the definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of ds ##m ( ds ##m - iv - tr ) , but ds ##m - 5 makes a number of changes . [SEP]
[CLS] the ic ##d - 10 criteria are typically used in european countries ; the ds ##m criteria are used in the united states and some other countries , and are prevailing in research studies . [SEP]
[CLS] psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder , and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified ; sc ##hi ##zo ##af ##fect ##ive disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] if the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance , then the diagnosis is one of a psycho ##sis secondary to that condition . [SEP]
[CLS] it can resemble schizophrenia and be mis ##dia ##gno ##sed as such . [SEP]
[CLS] a more general medical and neurological examination may be needed to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia - like symptoms , such as metabolic disturbance , systemic infection , sy ##phi ##lis , aids dementia complex , ep ##ile ##psy , limb ##ic en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is , and brain lesions . [SEP]
[CLS] stroke , multiple sc ##ler ##osis , hyper ##thy ##roid ##ism , h ##yp ##oth ##yr ##oid ##ism , and dementia ##s such as alzheimer ' s disease , huntington ' s disease , front ##ote ##mp ##ora ##l dementia , and the lew ##y body dementia ##s may also be associated with schizophrenia - like psychotic symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] investigations are not generally repeated for re ##la ##pse unless there is a specific " medical " indication or possible adverse effects from anti ##psy ##cho ##tic medication . [SEP]
[CLS] attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the pro ##drome phase is of uncertain benefit and therefore as of 2009 is not recommended . [SEP]
[CLS] cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psycho ##sis in those at high risk after a year and is recommended in this group , by the national institute for health and care excellence ( nice ) . [SEP]
[CLS] another prevent ##ative measure is to avoid drugs that have been associated with development of the disorder , including cannabis , cocaine , and amp ##het ##amine ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in those on anti ##psy ##cho ##tics , continued use decreases the risk of re ##la ##pse . [SEP]
[CLS] cl ##oza ##pine is an effective treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs ( " treatment - resistant " or " ref ##rac ##tory " schizophrenia ) , but it has the potentially serious side effect of agra ##nu ##lo ##cy ##tosis ( lowered white blood cell count ) in less than 4 % of people . [SEP]
[CLS] people on typical anti ##psy ##cho ##tics tend to have a higher rate of extra ##py ##ram ##idal side effects ; some at ##yp ##ical ##s are associated with considerable weight gain , diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome . [SEP]
[CLS] this is most pronounced with ol ##anza ##pine ; ri ##sper ##idon ##e and que ##tia ##pine are also associated with weight gain . [SEP]
[CLS] it remains unclear whether the newer anti ##psy ##cho ##tics reduce the chances of developing ne ##uro ##le ##ptic mali ##gnant syndrome or tar ##di ##ve d ##ys ##kin ##es ##ia , a rare but serious neurological disorder . [SEP]
[CLS] for people who are unwilling or unable to take medication regularly , long - acting depot preparations of anti ##psy ##cho ##tics may be used to achieve control . [SEP]
[CLS] when used in combination with psycho ##so ##cial interventions , they may improve long - term adherence to treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] the american psychiatric association suggests considering stopping anti ##psy ##cho ##tics in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of psycho ##so ##cial interventions may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia including : family therapy , assert ##ive community treatment , supported employment , cognitive re ##media ##tion , skills training , token economic interventions , and psycho ##so ##cial interventions for substance use and weight management . [SEP]
[CLS] family therapy or education , which addresses the whole family of a patient , may reduce re ##la ##pse ##s and hospital ##izations . [SEP]
[CLS] peer support , in which people with ex ##per ##ient ##ial knowledge of mental illness provide help to each other , is of unclear benefit in schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] this is primarily because of its association with obesity , poor diet , se ##dent ##ary lifestyle ##s , and smoking , with an increased rate of suicide playing a lesser role . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia is a major cause of disability , with active psycho ##sis ranked as the third - most - di ##sa ##bling condition after quad ##rip ##leg ##ia and dementia and ahead of para ##ple ##gia and blindness . [SEP]
[CLS] some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning . [SEP]
[CLS] this has been cited at 10 % , but a more recent analysis rev ##ises the estimate to 4 . 9 % , most often occurring in the period following onset or first hospital admission . [SEP]
[CLS] there are a variety of risk factors , including male gender , depression , and a high intelligence quo ##tie ##nt . [SEP]
[CLS] use of cigarettes is especially high in those diagnosed with schizophrenia , with estimates ranging from 80 to 90 % being regular smoke ##rs , as compared to 20 % of the general population . [SEP]
[CLS] it occurs 1 . 4 times more frequently in males than females and typically appears earlier in men — the peak ages of onset are 25 years for males and 27 years for females . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the prior belief that schizophrenia occurs at similar rates worldwide , its frequency varies across the world , within countries , and at the local and neighborhood level . [SEP]
[CLS] the rate of schizophrenia varies up to three ##fold depending on how it is defined . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2000 , the world health organization found the percentage of people affected and the number of new cases that develop each year is roughly similar around the world , with age - standardized prevalence per 100 , 000 ranging from 343 in africa to 54 ##4 in japan and oceania for men , and from 37 ##8 in africa to 52 ##7 in southeastern europe for women . [SEP]
[CLS] they include del ##usions of being controlled by an external force , the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one ' s conscious mind , the belief that one ' s thoughts are being broadcast to other people , and hearing hall ##uc ##inatory voices that comment on one ' s thoughts or actions or that have a conversation with other hall ##uc ##inated voices . [SEP]
[CLS] although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria , the specific ##ity of first - rank symptoms has been questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] a review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a rec ##on ##firm ##ation nor a rejection of schneider ' s claims , and suggested that first - rank symptoms should be de - emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems . [SEP]
[CLS] the history of schizophrenia is complex and does not lend itself easily to a linear narrative . [SEP]
[CLS] a detailed case report in 1797 concerning james till ##y matthews , and accounts by philippe pine ##l published in 1809 , are often regarded as the earliest cases of the illness in the medical and psychiatric literature . [SEP]
[CLS] the latin ##ized term " dementia pr ##ae ##co ##x " was first used by german alien ##ist heinrich sc ##hul ##e in 1886 and then in 1891 by arnold pick in a case report of a psychotic disorder ( he ##be ##ph ##ren ##ia ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1893 emil k ##rae ##pel ##in borrowed the term from sc ##hul ##e and pick and in 1899 introduced a broad new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between " dementia pr ##ae ##co ##x " and mood disorder ( termed mani ##c depression and including both un ##ip ##olar and bipolar depression ) . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##rae ##pel ##in believed that " dementia pr ##ae ##co ##x " was probably caused by a long - term , sm ##ou ##lder ##ing systemic or " whole body " disease process that affected many organs and peripheral nerves in the body but which affected the brain after pub ##erty in a final decisive cascade . [SEP]
[CLS] this account ignores the fact that there is little to connect more ##l ' s descriptive use of the term and the independent development of the " dementia pr ##ae ##co ##x " disease concept at the end of the nineteenth century . [SEP]
[CLS] b ##le ##ule ##r realized that the illness was " not " a dementia , as some of his patients improved rather than deteriorated , and thus proposed the term schizophrenia instead . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment was revolution ##ized in the mid - 1950s with the development and introduction of ch ##lor ##pro ##ma ##zine . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 1970s , the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were the subject of a number of controversies which eventually led to the operational criteria used today . [SEP]
[CLS] it became clear after the 1971 us – uk diagnostic study that schizophrenia was diagnosed to a far greater extent in america than in europe . [SEP]
[CLS] david rosen ##han ' s 1972 study , published in the journal " science " under the title " on being sane in insane places " , concluded that the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the us was often subjective and unreliable . [SEP]
[CLS] these were some of the factors leading to the revision not only of the diagnosis of schizophrenia , but the revision of the whole ds ##m manual , resulting in the publication of the ds ##m - iii in 1980 . [SEP]
[CLS] the term schizophrenia is commonly misunderstood to mean that affected persons have a " split personality " . [SEP]
[CLS] although some people diagnosed with schizophrenia may hear voices and may experience the voices as distinct personalities , schizophrenia does not involve a person changing among distinct , multiple personalities ; the confusion arises in part due to the literal interpretation of b ##le ##ule ##r ' s term " schizophrenia " ( b ##le ##ule ##r originally associated schizophrenia with di ##sso ##ciation , and included split personality in his category of schizophrenia ) . [SEP]
[CLS] di ##sso ##cia ##tive identity disorder ( having a " split personality " ) was also often mis ##dia ##gno ##sed as schizophrenia based on the loose criteria in the ds ##m - ii . [SEP]
[CLS] rather , the term means a " splitting of mental functions " , reflecting the presentation of the illness . [SEP]
[CLS] the new name was inspired by the bio ##psy ##cho ##so ##cial model ; it increased the percentage of people who were informed of the diagnosis from 37 to 70 % over three years . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , the cost of schizophrenia — including direct costs ( out ##patient , in ##patient , drugs , and long - term care ) and non - health care costs ( law enforcement , reduced workplace productivity , and unemployment ) — was estimated to be $ 62 . 7 billion in 2002 . [SEP]
[CLS] people with severe mental illness , including schizophrenia , are at a significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non - violent crime . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia has been associated with a higher rate of violent acts , but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse . [SEP]
[CLS] rates of homicide linked to psycho ##sis are similar to those linked to substance mis ##use , and parallel the overall rate in a region . [SEP]
[CLS] what role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug mis ##use is controversial , but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors . [SEP]
[CLS] another study found about 8 - 10 % of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2 % of the general population . [SEP]
[CLS] media coverage relating to violent acts by people with schizophrenia reinforce ##s public perception of an association between schizophrenia and violence . [SEP]
[CLS] over 74 % said that people with schizophrenia were either " not very able " or " not able at all " to make decisions concerning their treatment , and 70 . 2 % said the same of money - management decisions . [SEP]
[CLS] the perception of people with psycho ##sis as violent has more than doubled in prevalence since the 1950s , according to one meta - analysis . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia is not believed to occur in non - human species but it may be possible to develop a ph ##arm ##aco ##logical ##ly induced non ##hum ##an primate model of schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] research has found a tentative benefit in using min ##oc ##y ##cl ##ine to treat schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] ni ##dot ##her ##ap ##y or efforts to change the environment of people with schizophrenia to improve their ability to function , is also being studied but there is not enough evidence yet to make conclusions about its effectiveness . [SEP]
[CLS] negative symptoms have proven a challenge to treat , as they are generally not made better by medication . [SEP]
[CLS] there have been trials on drugs with anti - inflammatory activity , based on the premise that inflammation might play a role in the pathology of schizophrenia . [SEP]
