[CLS] schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal behavior , strange speech , and a decreased ability to understand reality . [SEP]
[CLS] other symptoms may include false beliefs , unclear or confused thinking , hearing voices that do not exist , reduced social engagement and emotional expression , and lack of motivation . [SEP]
[CLS] people with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety , depression , or substance - use disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] symptoms typically come on gradually , begin in young adulthood , and , in many cases , never resolve . [SEP]
[CLS] the causes of schizophrenia include environmental and genetic factors . [SEP]
[CLS] possible environmental factors include being raised in a city , cannabis use during adolescence , certain infections , the age of a person ' s parents , and poor nutrition during pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants . [SEP]
[CLS] diagnosis is based on observed behavior , the person ' s reported experiences and reports of others familiar with the person . [SEP]
[CLS] during diagnosis , a person ' s culture must also be taken into account . [SEP]
[CLS] as of 2013 , there is no objective test . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia does not imply a " split personality " or di ##sso ##cia ##tive identity disorder , conditions with which it is often confused in public perception . [SEP]
[CLS] the main ##sta ##y of treatment is anti ##psy ##cho ##tic medication , along with counsel ##ling , job training , and social rehabilitation . [SEP]
[CLS] it is unclear whether typical or at ##yp ##ical anti ##psy ##cho ##tics are better . [SEP]
[CLS] in those who do not improve with other anti ##psy ##cho ##tics , cl ##oza ##pine may be tried . [SEP]
[CLS] in more serious situations where there is risk to self or others , involuntary hospital ##ization may be necessary , although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were . [SEP]
[CLS] about 0 . 3 % to 0 . 7 % of people are affected by schizophrenia during their lifetime ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2013 , there were an estimated 23 . 6 million cases globally . [SEP]
[CLS] males are more often affected and onset is on average earlier in age . [SEP]
[CLS] about 20 % of people eventually do well , and a few recover completely . [SEP]
[CLS] about 50 % have lifelong impairment . [SEP]
[CLS] social problems , such as long - term unemployment , poverty , and homeless ##ness , are common . [SEP]
[CLS] the average life expect ##ancy of people with the disorder is 10 – 25 years less than that of the general population . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the result of increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate ( about 5 % ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2015 , an estimated 17 , 000 people worldwide died from behavior related to , or caused by , schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] people with schizophrenia may experience hall ##uc ##inations ( most reported are hearing voices ) , del ##usions ( often bizarre or per ##se ##cut ##ory in nature ) , and di ##sor ##gan ##ized thinking and speech . [SEP]
[CLS] the last may range from loss of train of thought , to sentences only loosely connected in meaning , to speech that is not understand ##able known as word salad . [SEP]
[CLS] social withdrawal , sl ##op ##pine ##ss of dress and hygiene , and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] distortion ##s of self - experience such as feeling as if one ' s thoughts or feelings are not really one ' s own to believing thoughts are being inserted into one ' s mind , sometimes termed pass ##ivity phenomena , are also common . [SEP]
[CLS] there is often an ob ##ser ##vable pattern of emotional difficulty , for example lack of responsive ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] impairment in social cognition is associated with schizophrenia , as are symptoms of paranoia . [SEP]
[CLS] social isolation commonly occurs . [SEP]
[CLS] difficulties in working and long - term memory , attention , executive functioning , and speed of processing also commonly occur . [SEP]
[CLS] in one uncommon sub ##type , the person may be largely mute , remain motionless in bizarre posture ##s , or exhibit purpose ##less agitation , all signs of cat ##aton ##ia . [SEP]
[CLS] people with schizophrenia often find facial emotion perception to be difficult . [SEP]
[CLS] it is unclear if the phenomenon called " thought blocking " , where a talking person suddenly becomes silent for a few seconds to minutes , occurs in schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] about 30 to 50 percent of people with schizophrenia fail to accept that they have an illness or comply with their recommended treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment may have some effect on insight . [SEP]
[CLS] people with schizophrenia may have a high rate of ir ##rita ##ble bow ##el syndrome , but they often do not mention it unless specifically asked . [SEP]
[CLS] psycho ##genic poly ##di ##ps ##ia , or excessive fluid intake in the absence of physiological reasons to drink , is relatively common in people with schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia is often described in terms of positive and negative ( or deficit ) symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] " positive symptoms " are those that most people do not normally experience , but are present in people with schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] they can include del ##usions , disorder ##ed thoughts and speech , and ta ##ct ##ile , auditory , visual , ol ##factory and gust ##atory hall ##uc ##inations , typically regarded as manifestation ##s of psycho ##sis . [SEP]
[CLS] hall ##uc ##inations are also typically related to the content of the del ##usion ##al theme . [SEP]
[CLS] positive symptoms generally respond well to medication . [SEP]
[CLS] " negative symptoms " are deficit ##s of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes , and are less responsive to medication . [SEP]
[CLS] they commonly include flat expressions or little emotion , poverty of speech , inability to experience pleasure , lack of desire to form relationships , and lack of motivation . [SEP]
[CLS] negative symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life , functional ability , and the burden on others than positive symptoms do . [SEP]
[CLS] people with greater negative symptoms often have a history of poor adjustment before the onset of illness , and response to medication is often limited . [SEP]
[CLS] the validity of the positive and negative construct has been challenged by factor analysis studies observing a three dimension grouping of symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] different terminology is used , but a dimension for hall ##uc ##inations , a dimension for di ##sor ##gan ##ization , and a dimension for negative symptoms are usually described . [SEP]
[CLS] deficit ##s in cognitive abilities are widely recognized as a core feature of schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] the extent of the cognitive deficit ##s someone experiences is a predict ##or of how functional they will be , the quality of occupational performance , and how successful they will be in maintaining treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in people with schizophrenia has been reported to be a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] the deficit ##s impact ##ing the cognitive function are found in a large number of areas : working memory , long - term memory , verbal dec ##lar ##ative memory , semantic processing , ep ##iso ##dic memory , attention , learning ( particularly verbal learning ) . [SEP]
[CLS] deficit ##s in verbal memory are the most pronounced in someone with schizophrenia , and are not accounted for by deficit in attention . [SEP]
[CLS] verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in those with schizophrenia to semantic ##ally en ##code ( process information relating to meaning ) , which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long - term memory . [SEP]
[CLS] when given a list of words , healthy people remember positive words more frequently ( known as the polly ##anna principle ) , but people with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their con ##not ##ations , suggesting that the experience of an ##hed ##onia imp ##air ##s the semantic encoding of the words . [SEP]
[CLS] these deficit ##s have been found in people before the onset of the illness to some extent . [SEP]
[CLS] first - degree family members of those with schizophrenia and other high - risk people also show a degree of deficit in cognitive abilities , and specifically in working memory . [SEP]
[CLS] a review of the literature on cognitive deficit ##s in people with schizophrenia shows that the deficit ##s may be present in early adolescence , or as early as childhood . [SEP]
[CLS] the deficit ##s which a person with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients , or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables . [SEP]
[CLS] although the evidence that cognitive deficit ##s remain stable over time is reliable and abundant , much of the research in this domain focuses on methods to improve attention and working memory . [SEP]
[CLS] efforts to improve learning ability in people with schizophrenia using a high - versus low - reward condition and an instruction - absent or instruction - present condition revealed that increasing reward leads to poorer performance while providing instruction leads to improved performance , highlighting that some treatments may exist to increase cognitive performance . [SEP]
[CLS] training people with schizophrenia to alter their thinking , attention , and language behaviors by verbal ##izing tasks , engaging in cognitive rehearsal , giving self - instructions , giving coping statements to the self to handle failure , and providing self - reinforcement for success , significantly improves performance on recall tasks . [SEP]
[CLS] this type of training , known as self - instructional ( si ) training , produced benefits such as lower number of nonsense verbal ##izations and improved recall when distracted . [SEP]
[CLS] late adolescence and early adulthood are peak periods for the onset of schizophrenia , critical years in a young adult ' s social and vocational development . [SEP]
[CLS] in 40 % of men and 23 % of women diagnosed with schizophrenia , the condition manifested itself before the age of 19 . [SEP]
[CLS] the most general symptoms of schizophrenia tend to appear between ages 16 and 30 . [SEP]
[CLS] the onset of the disorder is usually between ages 18 and 25 for men and between 25 and 35 for women . [SEP]
[CLS] to minimize the developmental disruption associated with schizophrenia , much work has recently been done to identify and treat the pro ##dro ##mal ( pre - onset ) phase of the disorder , which has been detected up to 30 months before the onset of symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] those who go on to develop schizophrenia may experience transient or self - limiting psychotic symptoms and the non - specific symptoms of social withdrawal , ir ##rita ##bility , d ##ys ##ph ##oria , and cl ##ums ##iness before the onset of the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] children who go on to develop schizophrenia may also demonstrate decreased intelligence , decreased motor development ( reaching milestone ##s such as walking slowly ) , isolated play preference , social anxiety , and poor school performance . [SEP]
[CLS] a combination of genetic and environmental factors play a role in the development of schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] people with a family history of schizophrenia who have a transient psycho ##sis have a 20 – 40 % chance of being diagnosed one year later . [SEP]
[CLS] estimates of the her ##ita ##bility of schizophrenia are around 80 % , which implies that 80 % of the individual differences in risk to schizophrenia is associated with genetics . [SEP]
[CLS] these estimates vary because of the difficulty in separating genetic and environmental influences and some have labeled these estimates inaccurate . [SEP]
[CLS] the greatest single risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first - degree relative with the disease ( risk is 6 . 5 % ) ; more than 40 % of mono ##zy ##go ##tic twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected . [SEP]
[CLS] if one parent is affected the risk is about 13 % and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50 % . [SEP]
[CLS] results of candidate gene studies of schizophrenia have generally failed to find consistent associations , and the genetic lo ##ci identified by genome - wide association studies as associated with schizophrenia explain only a small fraction of the variation in the disease . [SEP]
[CLS] many genes are known to be involved in schizophrenia , each of small effect and unknown transmission and expression . [SEP]
[CLS] the sum ##mation of these effect sizes into a poly ##genic risk score can explain at least 7 % of the variability in liability for schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] around 5 % of cases of schizophrenia are understood to be at least partially at ##tri ##bu ##table to rare copy number variants ( cn ##vs ) , including 22 ##q ##11 , 1 ##q ##21 and 16 ##p ##11 . [SEP]
[CLS] these rare cn ##vs increase the risk of someone developing the disorder by as much as 20 - fold , and are frequently como ##rb ##id with autism and intellectual disabilities . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder , an inverse genetic correlation with intelligence and no genetic correlation with immune disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] the question of how schizophrenia could be primarily genetically influenced , given that people with schizophrenia have lower fertility rates , is a paradox . [SEP]
[CLS] it is expected that genetic variants that increase the risk of schizophrenia would be selected against due to their negative effects on reproductive fitness . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of potential explanations have been proposed , including that all ##eles associated with schizophrenia risk con ##fers a fitness advantage in unaffected individuals . [SEP]
[CLS] while some evidence has not supported this idea , others propose that a large number of all ##eles each contributing a small amount can persist . [SEP]
[CLS] environmental factors associated with the development of schizophrenia include the living environment , drug use , and pre ##nat ##al stress ##ors . [SEP]
[CLS] maternal stress has been associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia , possibly in association with reel ##in . [SEP]
[CLS] maternal nutritional def ##iciencies , such as those observed during a famine , as well as maternal obesity have also been identified as possible risk factors for schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] both maternal stress and infection have been demonstrated to alter fetal ne ##uro ##dev ##elo ##pment through pro - inflammatory proteins such as il - 8 and tn ##f . [SEP]
[CLS] parenting style seems to have no major effect , although people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents . [SEP]
[CLS] childhood trauma , death of a parent , and being bull ##ied or abused increase the risk of psycho ##sis . [SEP]
[CLS] living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two , even after taking into account drug use , ethnic group , and size of social group . [SEP]
[CLS] other factors that play an important role include social isolation and immigration related to social ad ##vers ##ity , racial discrimination , family dysfunction , unemployment , and poor housing conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized that in some people , development of schizophrenia is related to int ##estinal tract dysfunction such as seen with non - celia ##c g ##lu ##ten sensitivity or abnormalities in the int ##estinal flora . [SEP]
[CLS] a subgroup of persons with schizophrenia present an immune response to g ##lu ##ten different from that found in people with celia ##c , with elevated levels of certain serum bio ##mark ##ers of g ##lu ##ten sensitivity such as anti - g ##lia ##din i ##gg or anti - g ##lia ##din i ##ga antibodies . [SEP]
[CLS] about half of those with schizophrenia use drugs or alcohol excessive ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] amp ##het ##amine , cocaine , and to a lesser extent alcohol , can result in a transient st ##im ##ula ##nt psycho ##sis or alcohol - related psycho ##sis that presents very similarly to schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] although it is not generally believed to be a cause of the illness , people with schizophrenia use nico ##tine at much higher rates than the general population . [SEP]
[CLS] alcohol abuse can occasionally cause the development of a chronic , substance - induced psychotic disorder via a kind ##ling mechanism . [SEP]
[CLS] alcohol use is not associated with an earlier onset of psycho ##sis . [SEP]
[CLS] cannabis may be a contributor ##y factor in schizophrenia , potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk . [SEP]
[CLS] the increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual . [SEP]
[CLS] among those who are at risk of psycho ##sis , it is associated with twice the rate . [SEP]
[CLS] other drugs may be used only as coping mechanisms by people who have schizophrenia , to deal with depression , anxiety , boredom , and loneliness . [SEP]
[CLS] factors such as h ##yp ##ox ##ia and infection , or stress and mal ##nut ##rit ##ion in the mother during fetal development , may result in a slight increase in the risk of schizophrenia later in life . [SEP]
[CLS] people diagnosed with schizophrenia are more likely to have been born in winter or spring ( at least in the northern hemisphere ) , which may be a result of increased rates of viral exposure ##s in ut ##ero . [SEP]
[CLS] the increased risk is about five to eight percent . [SEP]
[CLS] other infections during pregnancy or around the time of birth including " to ##x ##op ##las ##ma go ##ndi " and " ch ##lam ##yd ##ia " , and some pathogen ##s ser ##op ##osi ##tiv ##ity are linked to an increase in risk . [SEP]
[CLS] viral infections of the brain during childhood are also linked to a risk of psycho ##sis during adulthood . [SEP]
[CLS] while the mechanism of schizophrenia is unknown , a number of attempts have been made to explain the link between altered brain function and schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the most common is the do ##pa ##mine hypothesis , which attributes psycho ##sis to the mind ' s faulty interpretation of the mis ##fi ##ring of do ##pa ##mine ##rg ##ic neurons . [SEP]
[CLS] other possible mechanisms include g ##lu ##tam ##iner ##gic ne ##uro ##tra ##ns ##mission and ne ##uro ##dev ##elo ##pment . [SEP]
[CLS] framework ##s have h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized links between these biological abnormalities and symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] abnormal do ##pa ##mine signalling has been implicated in schizophrenia based on the useful ##ness of medications that effect the do ##pa ##mine receptor and the observation that do ##pa ##mine levels are increased during acute psycho ##sis . [SEP]
[CLS] abnormalities in do ##pa ##mine signalling have been h ##yp ##oth ##es ##ized to under ##lie del ##usions . [SEP]
[CLS] a decrease in d receptors in the pre ##front ##al cortex may also be responsible for deficit ##s in working memory . [SEP]
[CLS] reduced nm ##da receptor signalling is suggested by multiple lines of evidence . [SEP]
[CLS] studies demonstrate reduced nm ##da receptor expression and nm ##da receptor block ##ers mimic both schizophrenia symptoms and the physiological abnormalities associated with schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] post - mort ##em studies consistently find that a subset of these neurons fail to express ga ##d ##6 ##7 , in addition to abnormalities in morphology . [SEP]
[CLS] the subset ##s of intern ##eur ##ons that are abnormal in schizophrenia are responsible for the sync ##hr ##oni ##zing of neural ensembles that is necessary during working memory tasks , a process that is electro ##phy ##sio ##logical ##ly reflected in gamma frequency ( 30 – 80 hz ) os ##ci ##llation ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] both working memory tasks and gamma os ##ci ##llation ##s are impaired in schizophrenia , which may reflect abnormal intern ##eur ##on functionality . [SEP]
[CLS] evidence suggest that schizophrenia has a ne ##uro ##dev ##elo ##pment ##al component . [SEP]
[CLS] before the onset of schizophrenia there is often impairment ##s in cognition , social functioning , and motor skills . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , problems before birth such as maternal infection , maternal mal ##nut ##rit ##ion and complications during pregnancy all increase risk for schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia usually emerges 18 - 25 , an age period that overlap ##s with certain stages of ne ##uro ##dev ##elo ##pment that are implicated in schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] deficit ##s in executive functions , such as planning , inhibition , and working memory , are per ##vas ##ive in schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] although these functions are di ##sso ##cia ##ble , their dysfunction in schizophrenia may reflect an underlying deficit in the ability to represent goal related information in working memory , and to utilize this to direct cognition and behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] these impairment ##s have been linked to a number of ne ##uro ##ima ##ging and ne ##uro ##path ##ological abnormalities . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , functional ne ##uro ##ima ##ging studies report evidence of reduced neural processing efficiency , whereby the do ##rso ##lateral pre ##front ##al cortex is activated to a greater degree to achieve a certain level of performance relative to controls on working memory tasks . [SEP]
[CLS] these abnormalities may be linked to the consistent post - mort ##em finding of reduced ne ##uro ##pi ##l , evidenced by increased pyramid ##al cell density and reduced dent ##rit ##ic spine density . [SEP]
[CLS] these cellular and functional abnormalities may also be reflected in structural ne ##uro ##ima ##ging studies that find reduced grey matter volume in association with deficit ##s in working memory tasks . [SEP]
[CLS] positive and negative symptoms have been linked to reduced co ##rti ##cal thickness in the superior temporal lobe , and orbit ##of ##ron ##tal cortex , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] an ##hed ##onia , traditionally defined as a reduced capacity to experience pleasure , is frequently reported in schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a large body of evidence suggests that he ##don ##ic responses are intact in schizophrenia , and that what is reported to be an ##hed ##onia is a reflection of dysfunction in other processes related to reward . [SEP]
[CLS] overall , a failure of online maintenance and reward ass ##oc ##ia ##tiv ##ity is thought to lead to impairment in the generation of cognition and behavior required to obtain rewards , despite normal he ##don ##ic responses . [SEP]
[CLS] bay ##esian models of brain functioning have been utilized to link abnormalities in cellular functioning to symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] both hall ##uc ##inations and del ##usions have been suggested to reflect improper encoding of prior expectations , thereby causing expectation to excessive ##ly influence sensory perception and the formation of beliefs . [SEP]
[CLS] in canonical models of circuits that media ##te predict ##ive coding , h ##yp ##oa ##ctive nm ##da receptor activation , similar to that seen in schizophrenia , could theoretically result in classic symptoms of schizophrenia such as del ##usions and hall ##uc ##inations . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the american psychiatric association ' s ( ap ##a ) fifth edition of the " diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders " ( ds ##m 5 ) or the world health organization ' s international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems ( ic ##d - 10 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these criteria use the self - reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior , followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional . [SEP]
[CLS] symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment before a diagnosis is made . [SEP]
[CLS] as of 2013 , there is no objective test . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2013 , the american psychiatric association released the fifth edition of the ds ##m ( ds ##m - 5 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] to be diagnosed with schizophrenia , two diagnostic criteria have to be met over much of the time of a period of at least one month , with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months . [SEP]
[CLS] the person had to be suffering from del ##usions , hall ##uc ##inations , or di ##sor ##gan ##ized speech . [SEP]
[CLS] a second sy ##mpt ##om could be negative symptoms , or severely di ##sor ##gan ##ized or cat ##aton ##ic behaviour . [SEP]
[CLS] the definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of ds ##m ( ds ##m - iv - tr ) , but ds ##m - 5 makes a number of changes . [SEP]
[CLS] the ic ##d - 10 criteria are typically used in european countries ; the ds ##m criteria are used in the united states and some other countries , and are prevailing in research studies . [SEP]
[CLS] the ic ##d - 10 criteria put more emphasis on schneider ##ian first - rank symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] in practice , agreement between the two systems is high . [SEP]
[CLS] the current proposal for the ic ##d - 11 criteria for schizophrenia recommends adding self - disorder as a sy ##mpt ##om . [SEP]
[CLS] if signs of disturbance are present for more than a month but less than six months , the diagnosis of sc ##hi ##zo ##ph ##ren ##iform disorder is applied . [SEP]
[CLS] psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder , and various conditions may be classed as psychotic disorder not otherwise specified ; sc ##hi ##zo ##af ##fect ##ive disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] if the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance , then the diagnosis is one of a psycho ##sis secondary to that condition . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of per ##vas ##ive developmental disorder are present unless prominent del ##usions or hall ##uc ##inations are also present . [SEP]
[CLS] with the publication of ds ##m - 5 , the ap ##a removed all sub - classifications of schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] psychotic symptoms may be present in several other mental disorders , including bipolar disorder , border ##line personality disorder , drug into ##xi ##cation , and drug - induced psycho ##sis . [SEP]
[CLS] del ##usions ( " non - bizarre " ) are also present in del ##usion ##al disorder , and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder , avoid ##ant personality disorder and sc ##hi ##zo ##ty ##pal personality disorder . [SEP]
[CLS] sc ##hi ##zo ##ty ##pal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia occurs along with ob ##ses ##sive - com ##pu ##ls ##ive disorder ( o ##cd ) considerably more often than could be explained by chance , although it can be difficult to distinguish obsession ##s that occur in o ##cd from the del ##usions of schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] a few people withdrawing from benz ##od ##ia ##ze ##pine ##s experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time . [SEP]
[CLS] it can resemble schizophrenia and be mis ##dia ##gno ##sed as such . [SEP]
[CLS] a more general medical and neurological examination may be needed to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia - like symptoms , such as metabolic disturbance , systemic infection , sy ##phi ##lis , aids dementia complex , ep ##ile ##psy , limb ##ic en ##ce ##pha ##lit ##is , and brain lesions . [SEP]
[CLS] stroke , multiple sc ##ler ##osis , hyper ##thy ##roid ##ism , h ##yp ##oth ##yr ##oid ##ism , and dementia ##s such as alzheimer ' s disease , huntington ' s disease , front ##ote ##mp ##ora ##l dementia , and the lew ##y body dementia ##s may also be associated with schizophrenia - like psychotic symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] it may be necessary to rule out a del ##iri ##um , which can be distinguished by visual hall ##uc ##inations , acute onset and flu ##ct ##uating level of consciousness , and indicates an underlying medical illness . [SEP]
[CLS] investigations are not generally repeated for re ##la ##pse unless there is a specific " medical " indication or possible adverse effects from anti ##psy ##cho ##tic medication . [SEP]
[CLS] in children hall ##uc ##inations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies . [SEP]
[CLS] prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder . [SEP]
[CLS] there is tentative evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] there is some evidence that early intervention in those with a psychotic episode may improve short - term outcomes , but there is little benefit from these measures after five years . [SEP]
[CLS] attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the pro ##drome phase is of uncertain benefit and therefore as of 2009 is not recommended . [SEP]
[CLS] cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psycho ##sis in those at high risk after a year and is recommended in this group , by the national institute for health and care excellence ( nice ) . [SEP]
[CLS] another prevent ##ative measure is to avoid drugs that have been associated with development of the disorder , including cannabis , cocaine , and amp ##het ##amine ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the primary treatment of schizophrenia is anti ##psy ##cho ##tic medications , often in combination with psychological and social supports . [SEP]
[CLS] hospital ##ization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or ( if mental health legislation allows it ) in ##vo ##lun ##tar ##ily . [SEP]
[CLS] long - term hospital ##ization is uncommon since dei ##nst ##it ##ution ##ali ##zation beginning in the 1950s , although it still occurs . [SEP]
[CLS] community support services including drop - in centers , visits by members of a community mental health team , supported employment and support groups are common . [SEP]
[CLS] some evidence indicates that regular exercise has a positive effect on the physical and mental health of those with schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] as of 2015 it is unclear if trans ##cr ##anial magnetic stimulation ( t ##ms ) is useful for schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] the first - line psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia is anti ##psy ##cho ##tic medication , which can reduce the positive symptoms of psycho ##sis in about 7 to 14 days . [SEP]
[CLS] anti ##psy ##cho ##tics fail to significantly improve the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction . [SEP]
[CLS] in those on anti ##psy ##cho ##tics , continued use decreases the risk of re ##la ##pse . [SEP]
[CLS] there is little evidence regarding effects from their use beyond two or three years . [SEP]
[CLS] use of anti - psychotic ##s can lead to do ##pa ##mine hyper ##sen ##sit ##ivity increasing the risk of symptoms if anti ##psy ##cho ##tics are stopped . [SEP]
[CLS] the choice of which anti ##psy ##cho ##tic to use is based on benefits , risks , and costs . [SEP]
[CLS] it is de ##bat ##able whether , as a class , typical or at ##yp ##ical anti ##psy ##cho ##tics are better . [SEP]
[CLS] ami ##sul ##pr ##ide , ol ##anza ##pine , ri ##sper ##idon ##e , and cl ##oza ##pine may be more effective but are associated with greater side effects . [SEP]
[CLS] typical anti ##psy ##cho ##tics have equal drop - out and sy ##mpt ##om re ##la ##pse rates to at ##yp ##ical ##s when used at low to moderate dos ##ages . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a good response in 40 – 50 % , a partial response in 30 – 40 % , and treatment resistance ( failure of symptoms to respond sat ##is ##fa ##ctor ##ily after six weeks to two or three different anti ##psy ##cho ##tics ) in 20 % of people . [SEP]
[CLS] cl ##oza ##pine is an effective treatment for those who respond poorly to other drugs ( " treatment - resistant " or " ref ##rac ##tory " schizophrenia ) , but it has the potentially serious side effect of agra ##nu ##lo ##cy ##tosis ( lowered white blood cell count ) in less than 4 % of people . [SEP]
[CLS] most people on anti ##psy ##cho ##tics have side effects . [SEP]
[CLS] people on typical anti ##psy ##cho ##tics tend to have a higher rate of extra ##py ##ram ##idal side effects ; some at ##yp ##ical ##s are associated with considerable weight gain , diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome . [SEP]
[CLS] this is most pronounced with ol ##anza ##pine ; ri ##sper ##idon ##e and que ##tia ##pine are also associated with weight gain . [SEP]
[CLS] ri ##sper ##idon ##e has a similar rate of extra ##py ##ram ##idal symptoms to halo ##per ##ido ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] it remains unclear whether the newer anti ##psy ##cho ##tics reduce the chances of developing ne ##uro ##le ##ptic mali ##gnant syndrome or tar ##di ##ve d ##ys ##kin ##es ##ia , a rare but serious neurological disorder . [SEP]
[CLS] for people who are unwilling or unable to take medication regularly , long - acting depot preparations of anti ##psy ##cho ##tics may be used to achieve control . [SEP]
[CLS] they reduce the risk of re ##la ##pse to a greater degree than oral medications . [SEP]
[CLS] when used in combination with psycho ##so ##cial interventions , they may improve long - term adherence to treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] the american psychiatric association suggests considering stopping anti ##psy ##cho ##tics in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of psycho ##so ##cial interventions may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia including : family therapy , assert ##ive community treatment , supported employment , cognitive re ##media ##tion , skills training , token economic interventions , and psycho ##so ##cial interventions for substance use and weight management . [SEP]
[CLS] family therapy or education , which addresses the whole family of a patient , may reduce re ##la ##pse ##s and hospital ##izations . [SEP]
[CLS] evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive - behavioral therapy ( cb ##t ) in either reducing symptoms or preventing re ##la ##pse is minimal . [SEP]
[CLS] evidence for meta ##co ##gni ##tive training is mixed with some reviews finding benefit and another not . [SEP]
[CLS] art or drama therapy have not been well - researched . [SEP]
[CLS] peer support , in which people with ex ##per ##ient ##ial knowledge of mental illness provide help to each other , is of unclear benefit in schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia has great human and economic costs . [SEP]
[CLS] it results in a decreased life expect ##ancy by 10 – 25 years . [SEP]
[CLS] this is primarily because of its association with obesity , poor diet , se ##dent ##ary lifestyle ##s , and smoking , with an increased rate of suicide playing a lesser role . [SEP]
[CLS] anti ##psy ##cho ##tic medications may also increase the risk . [SEP]
[CLS] these differences in life expect ##ancy increased between the 1970s and 1990s . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia is a major cause of disability , with active psycho ##sis ranked as the third - most - di ##sa ##bling condition after quad ##rip ##leg ##ia and dementia and ahead of para ##ple ##gia and blindness . [SEP]
[CLS] approximately three - fourth ##s of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with re ##la ##pse ##s and 16 . 7 million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition . [SEP]
[CLS] some people do recover completely and others function well in society . [SEP]
[CLS] most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support . [SEP]
[CLS] about 85 % are unemployed . [SEP]
[CLS] some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning . [SEP]
[CLS] in people with a first episode of psycho ##sis a good long - term outcome occurs in 42 % , an intermediate outcome in 35 % and a poor outcome in 27 % . [SEP]
[CLS] outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world . [SEP]
[CLS] these conclusions have been questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a higher than average suicide rate associated with schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] this has been cited at 10 % , but a more recent analysis rev ##ises the estimate to 4 . 9 % , most often occurring in the period following onset or first hospital admission . [SEP]
[CLS] several times more ( 20 to 40 % ) attempt suicide at least once . [SEP]
[CLS] there are a variety of risk factors , including male gender , depression , and a high intelligence quo ##tie ##nt . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia and smoking have shown a strong association in studies worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] use of cigarettes is especially high in those diagnosed with schizophrenia , with estimates ranging from 80 to 90 % being regular smoke ##rs , as compared to 20 % of the general population . [SEP]
[CLS] those who smoke tend to smoke heavily , and additionally smoke cigarettes with high nico ##tine content . [SEP]
[CLS] some propose that this is in an effort to improve symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] among people with schizophrenia use of cannabis is also common . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia affects around 0 . 3 – 0 . 7 % of people at some point in their life , or 24 million people worldwide as of 2011 . [SEP]
[CLS] it occurs 1 . 4 times more frequently in males than females and typically appears earlier in men — the peak ages of onset are 25 years for males and 27 years for females . [SEP]
[CLS] onset in childhood is much rare ##r , as is onset in middle or old age . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the prior belief that schizophrenia occurs at similar rates worldwide , its frequency varies across the world , within countries , and at the local and neighborhood level . [SEP]
[CLS] this variation has been estimated to be five ##fold . [SEP]
[CLS] it causes approximately one percent of worldwide disability adjusted life years and resulted in 20 , 000 deaths in 2010 . [SEP]
[CLS] the rate of schizophrenia varies up to three ##fold depending on how it is defined . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2000 , the world health organization found the percentage of people affected and the number of new cases that develop each year is roughly similar around the world , with age - standardized prevalence per 100 , 000 ranging from 343 in africa to 54 ##4 in japan and oceania for men , and from 37 ##8 in africa to 52 ##7 in southeastern europe for women . [SEP]
[CLS] about 1 . 1 % of adults have schizophrenia in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 20th century , the psychiatrist kurt schneider listed the forms of psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] these are called " first - rank symptoms " or schneider ' s first - rank symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] they include del ##usions of being controlled by an external force , the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one ' s conscious mind , the belief that one ' s thoughts are being broadcast to other people , and hearing hall ##uc ##inatory voices that comment on one ' s thoughts or actions or that have a conversation with other hall ##uc ##inated voices . [SEP]
[CLS] although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria , the specific ##ity of first - rank symptoms has been questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] a review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a rec ##on ##firm ##ation nor a rejection of schneider ' s claims , and suggested that first - rank symptoms should be de - emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems . [SEP]
[CLS] the absence of first - rank symptoms should raise suspicion of a medical disorder . [SEP]
[CLS] the history of schizophrenia is complex and does not lend itself easily to a linear narrative . [SEP]
[CLS] accounts of a schizophrenia - like syndrome are thought to be rare in historical records before the 19th century , although reports of irrational , un ##int ##elli ##gible , or un ##con ##tro ##lled behavior were common . [SEP]
[CLS] a detailed case report in 1797 concerning james till ##y matthews , and accounts by philippe pine ##l published in 1809 , are often regarded as the earliest cases of the illness in the medical and psychiatric literature . [SEP]
[CLS] the latin ##ized term " dementia pr ##ae ##co ##x " was first used by german alien ##ist heinrich sc ##hul ##e in 1886 and then in 1891 by arnold pick in a case report of a psychotic disorder ( he ##be ##ph ##ren ##ia ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1893 emil k ##rae ##pel ##in borrowed the term from sc ##hul ##e and pick and in 1899 introduced a broad new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between " dementia pr ##ae ##co ##x " and mood disorder ( termed mani ##c depression and including both un ##ip ##olar and bipolar depression ) . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##rae ##pel ##in believed that " dementia pr ##ae ##co ##x " was probably caused by a long - term , sm ##ou ##lder ##ing systemic or " whole body " disease process that affected many organs and peripheral nerves in the body but which affected the brain after pub ##erty in a final decisive cascade . [SEP]
[CLS] his use of the term " pr ##ae ##co ##x " distinguished it from other forms of dementia such as alzheimer ' s disease which typically occur later in life . [SEP]
[CLS] it is sometimes argued that the use of the term " dem ##ence pre ##co ##ce " in 1852 by the french physician benedict more ##l constitutes the medical discovery of schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] this account ignores the fact that there is little to connect more ##l ' s descriptive use of the term and the independent development of the " dementia pr ##ae ##co ##x " disease concept at the end of the nineteenth century . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " schizophrenia " — which translates roughly as " splitting of the mind " and comes from the greek roots " sc ##hi ##ze ##in " ( σ ##χ ##ι ##ζ ##ε ##ι ##ν , " to split " ) and " ph ##ren " , " ph ##ren - " ( φ ##ρ ##η ##ν , φ ##ρ ##ε ##ν - , " mind " ) — was coined by eugen b ##le ##ule ##r in 1908 and was intended to describe the separation of function between personality , thinking , memory , and perception . [SEP]
[CLS] american and british interpretations of b ##le ##ule ##r led to the claim that he described its main symptoms as four " a " ' s : flattened " affect " , " autism " , impaired " association " of ideas , and " am ##bi ##vale ##nce " . [SEP]
[CLS] b ##le ##ule ##r realized that the illness was " not " a dementia , as some of his patients improved rather than deteriorated , and thus proposed the term schizophrenia instead . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment was revolution ##ized in the mid - 1950s with the development and introduction of ch ##lor ##pro ##ma ##zine . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 1970s , the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were the subject of a number of controversies which eventually led to the operational criteria used today . [SEP]
[CLS] it became clear after the 1971 us – uk diagnostic study that schizophrenia was diagnosed to a far greater extent in america than in europe . [SEP]
[CLS] this was partly due to loose ##r diagnostic criteria in the us , which used the ds ##m - ii manual , contrasting with europe and its ic ##d - 9 . [SEP]
[CLS] david rosen ##han ' s 1972 study , published in the journal " science " under the title " on being sane in insane places " , concluded that the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the us was often subjective and unreliable . [SEP]
[CLS] these were some of the factors leading to the revision not only of the diagnosis of schizophrenia , but the revision of the whole ds ##m manual , resulting in the publication of the ds ##m - iii in 1980 . [SEP]
[CLS] the term schizophrenia is commonly misunderstood to mean that affected persons have a " split personality " . [SEP]
[CLS] although some people diagnosed with schizophrenia may hear voices and may experience the voices as distinct personalities , schizophrenia does not involve a person changing among distinct , multiple personalities ; the confusion arises in part due to the literal interpretation of b ##le ##ule ##r ' s term " schizophrenia " ( b ##le ##ule ##r originally associated schizophrenia with di ##sso ##ciation , and included split personality in his category of schizophrenia ) . [SEP]
[CLS] di ##sso ##cia ##tive identity disorder ( having a " split personality " ) was also often mis ##dia ##gno ##sed as schizophrenia based on the loose criteria in the ds ##m - ii . [SEP]
[CLS] the first known mis ##use of the term to mean " split personality " was in an article by the poet t . s . eliot in 1933 . [SEP]
[CLS] other scholars have traced earlier roots . [SEP]
[CLS] rather , the term means a " splitting of mental functions " , reflecting the presentation of the illness . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2002 , the term for schizophrenia in japan was changed from se ##ish ##in - bun ##ret ##su - by ##o ( [UNK] 神 分 [UNK] [UNK] , lit . [SEP]
[CLS] " mind - split disease " ) to togo - shit ##cho - sho ( [UNK] 合 [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] , lit . [SEP]
[CLS] " integration disorder " ) to reduce stigma . [SEP]
[CLS] the new name was inspired by the bio ##psy ##cho ##so ##cial model ; it increased the percentage of people who were informed of the diagnosis from 37 to 70 % over three years . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar change was made in south korea in 2012 . [SEP]
[CLS] a professor of psychiatry , jim van os , has proposed changing the english term to " psycho ##sis spectrum syndrome " . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , the cost of schizophrenia — including direct costs ( out ##patient , in ##patient , drugs , and long - term care ) and non - health care costs ( law enforcement , reduced workplace productivity , and unemployment ) — was estimated to be $ 62 . 7 billion in 2002 . [SEP]
[CLS] the book and film " a beautiful mind " chronicles the life of john forbes nash , a mathematician who won the nobel prize for economics and was diagnosed with schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] people with severe mental illness , including schizophrenia , are at a significantly greater risk of being victims of both violent and non - violent crime . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia has been associated with a higher rate of violent acts , but most appear to be related to associated substance abuse . [SEP]
[CLS] rates of homicide linked to psycho ##sis are similar to those linked to substance mis ##use , and parallel the overall rate in a region . [SEP]
[CLS] what role schizophrenia has on violence independent of drug mis ##use is controversial , but certain aspects of individual histories or mental states may be factors . [SEP]
[CLS] about 11 % of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia and 21 % have mood disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] another study found about 8 - 10 % of people with schizophrenia had committed a violent act in the past year compared to 2 % of the general population . [SEP]
[CLS] media coverage relating to violent acts by people with schizophrenia reinforce ##s public perception of an association between schizophrenia and violence . [SEP]
[CLS] in a large , representative sample from a 1999 study , 12 . 8 % of americans believed that those with schizophrenia were " very likely " to do something violent against others , and 48 . 1 % said that they were " somewhat likely " to . [SEP]
[CLS] over 74 % said that people with schizophrenia were either " not very able " or " not able at all " to make decisions concerning their treatment , and 70 . 2 % said the same of money - management decisions . [SEP]
[CLS] the perception of people with psycho ##sis as violent has more than doubled in prevalence since the 1950s , according to one meta - analysis . [SEP]
[CLS] schizophrenia is not believed to occur in non - human species but it may be possible to develop a ph ##arm ##aco ##logical ##ly induced non ##hum ##an primate model of schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] research has found a tentative benefit in using min ##oc ##y ##cl ##ine to treat schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] ni ##dot ##her ##ap ##y or efforts to change the environment of people with schizophrenia to improve their ability to function , is also being studied but there is not enough evidence yet to make conclusions about its effectiveness . [SEP]
[CLS] negative symptoms have proven a challenge to treat , as they are generally not made better by medication . [SEP]
[CLS] various agents have been explored for possible benefits in this area . [SEP]
[CLS] there have been trials on drugs with anti - inflammatory activity , based on the premise that inflammation might play a role in the pathology of schizophrenia . [SEP]
