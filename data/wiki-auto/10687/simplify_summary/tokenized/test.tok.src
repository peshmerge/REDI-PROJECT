[CLS] a fr ##is ##bee ( pronounced , origin of the term dates to 1957 , also called a flying disc or simply a disc ) is a gliding toy or sporting item that is generally plastic and roughly 8 to in diameter with a pronounced lip . [SEP]
[CLS] it is used recreational ##ly and competitive ##ly for throwing and catching , as in flying disc games . [SEP]
[CLS] the shape of the disc is an air ##foil in cross - section which allows it to fly by generating lift as it moves through the air . [SEP]
[CLS] spinning it imp ##arts a stab ##ili ##zing g ##yr ##os ##copic force , allowing it to be both aimed and thrown for distance . [SEP]
[CLS] a wide range is available of flying disc variants . [SEP]
[CLS] those for disc golf are usually smaller but dense ##r and tailored for particular flight profiles to increase or decrease stability and distance . [SEP]
[CLS] the longest recorded disc throw is by david wig ##gins , jr . with a distance of 110 ##9 feet . [SEP]
[CLS] disc dog sports use relatively slow - flying discs made of more pl ##iable material to better resist a dog ' s bite and prevent injury to the dog . [SEP]
[CLS] flying rings are also available which typically travel significantly farther than any traditional flying disc . [SEP]
[CLS] illuminated discs are made of ph ##os ##ph ##ores ##cent plastic or contain che ##mi ##lum ##ines ##cent fluid or battery - powered led ##s for play after dark . [SEP]
[CLS] others whistle when they reach a certain velocity in flight . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " fr ##is ##bee " is often used generic ##ally to describe all flying discs , but fr ##is ##bee is a registered trademark of the w ##ham - o toy company . [SEP]
[CLS] this protection results in organized sports such as ultimate or disc golf having to for ##go use of the word " fr ##is ##bee " . [SEP]
[CLS] humans have been tossing disc - shaped objects since time im ##me ##mori ##al . [SEP]
[CLS] at first these were found objects such as rocks worn smooth in stream beds . [SEP]
[CLS] some were tossed for fun while others were used as weapons such as the discus . [SEP]
[CLS] throwing the discus became an event in the olympic games of ancient greece . [SEP]
[CLS] later , objects such as mats , hats , lids , pie tin ##s , and cake pan ##s were found to be perfect for tossing . [SEP]
[CLS] walter frederick morrison and his future wife luc ##ile had fun tossing a popcorn can lid after a thanksgiving day dinner in 1937 . [SEP]
[CLS] they soon discovered a market for a light duty flying disc when they were offered 25 cents for a cake pan that they were tossing back and forth on a beach near los angeles , california . [SEP]
[CLS] " that got the wheels turning , because you could buy a cake pan for five cents , and if people on the beach were willing to pay a quarter for it , well — there was a business , " morrison told " the virginia ##n - pilot " newspaper in 2007 . [SEP]
[CLS] the morrison ##s continued their business until world war ii , when he served in the army air force flying p - 47 ##s , and then was a prisoner of war . [SEP]
[CLS] after the war , morrison sketch ##ed a design for an aerodynamic ##ally improved flying disc that he called the w ##hir ##lo - way . [SEP]
[CLS] after the famous racehorse . [SEP]
[CLS] he and business partner warren fran ##sc ##ion ##i began producing the first plastic discs by 1948 , after design modifications and experimentation with several prototypes . [SEP]
[CLS] they renamed them the fly ##in - sauce ##r in the wake of reported unidentified flying object - sighting ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] " we worked fairs , demonstrating it , " morrison told the " virginia ##n - pilot " . [SEP]
[CLS] the two of them once overheard someone saying that the pair were using wires to make the discs hove ##r , so they developed a sales pitch : " the fly ##in - sauce ##r is free , but the invisible wire is $ 1 . " [SEP]
[CLS] " that ' s where we learned we could sell these things , " he said , because people were enthusiastic about them . [SEP]
[CLS] morrison and fran ##sc ##ion ##i ended their partnership in early 1950 , and morrison formed his own company in 1954 called american trends to buy and sell fly ##in sauce ##rs , which were being made of a flexible poly ##pro ##py ##lene plastic by southern california plastics , the original mold ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] he discovered that he could produce his own disc more cheap ##ly , and he designed a new model in 1955 called the pluto platt ##er , the arch ##ety ##pe of all modern flying discs . [SEP]
[CLS] he sold the rights to w ##ham - o on january 23 , 1957 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1958 , morrison was awarded u . s . design patent for his product . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 1957 , w ##ham - o co - founders richard kn ##er ##r and arthur " sp ##ud " mel ##in gave the disc the brand name " fr ##is ##bee " after learning that college students were calling the pluto platt ##er by that term , which was derived from the connecticut - based pie manufacturer fr ##is ##bie pie company , a supplier of pie ##s to yale university where students had started a campus cr ##az ##e tossing empty pie tin ##s stamped with the company ' s logo — the way that morrison and his wife had in 1937 . [SEP]
[CLS] the man behind the fr ##is ##bee ' s success , however , was southern california ##n edward head ##rick , hired in 1964 as w ##ham - o ' s general manager and vice president of marketing . [SEP]
[CLS] head ##rick redesigned the pluto platt ##er by re ##working the mold , mainly to remove the names of the planets , but fort ##uit ##ously increasing the rim thickness and mass in the process , creating a more control ##lab ##le disc that could be thrown more accurately . [SEP]
[CLS] w ##ham - o changed their marketing strategy to promote fr ##is ##bee use as a new sport , and sales sky ##rock ##ete ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1964 , the first professional model went on sale . [SEP]
[CLS] head ##rick patented its design ; it featured raised ridges ( the " rings of head ##rick " ) that were claimed to stabilize flight . [SEP]
[CLS] head ##rick became known as the father of fr ##is ##bee sports ; he founded the international fr ##is ##bee association and appointed dan rod ##dick as its head . [SEP]
[CLS] rod ##dick began establishing north american series ( nas ) tournament standards for various fr ##is ##bee sports , such as freestyle , guts , double disc court , and overall events . [SEP]
[CLS] head ##rick later helped to develop the sport of disc golf by in ##venting standardized targets called " pole holes " , that was first played with fr ##is ##bee ##s and later with more aerodynamic be ##vel ##ed rim discs . [SEP]
[CLS] when head ##rick died , he was cremated , and his ashes were molded into memorial discs and given to family and close friends and sold to benefit the ed head ##rick memorial museum . [SEP]
[CLS] the world record is currently held by richard and may bra ##ate ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] the record is 122 caught fr ##is ##bee ##s in a row without a single drop . [SEP]
[CLS] it was set september 2 , 2012 , in man ##lius , ny . [SEP]
[CLS] the fr ##is ##bee was inducted into the national toy hall of fame in 1998 . [SEP]
[CLS] the if ##t guts competitions in northern michigan , the canadian open fr ##is ##bee championships ( 1972 ) , toronto , on , the vancouver open fr ##is ##bee championships ( 1974 ) , vancouver , bc , the oct ##ad ( 1974 ) , new jersey , the american flying disc open ( 1974 ) , rochester , ny and the world fr ##is ##bee championships ( 1974 ) , pasadena , ca are the earliest fr ##is ##bee competitions that presented the fr ##is ##bee as a new disc sport . [SEP]
[CLS] before these tournaments , the fr ##is ##bee was considered a toy and used for recreation . [SEP]
[CLS] double disc court was invented and introduced in 1974 by jim palmer ##i , a sport played with two flying discs and two teams of two players . [SEP]
[CLS] each team defend ##s its court and tries to land a flying disc in the opposing court . [SEP]
[CLS] dogs and their human flying disc throw ##ers compete in events such as distance catching and somewhat choreographed freestyle catching . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a precision and accuracy sport in which individual players throw a flying disc at a target pole hole . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1926 , in b ##lad ##worth , saskatchewan , canada , ronald gibson and a group of his b ##lad ##worth elementary school chu ##ms played a game using metal lids , they called " tin lid golf . " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1976 , the game of disc golf was standardized with targets called " pole holes " invented and developed by w ##ham - o ' s ed head ##rick . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1974 , freestyle competition was created and introduced by ken west ##er ##field and disc ##raf ##ts jim ken ##ner . [SEP]
[CLS] teams of two or three players are judged as they perform a routine that consists of a series of creative throwing and catching techniques set to music . [SEP]
[CLS] a half - court disc game derived from ultimate , similar to hot box . [SEP]
[CLS] the object is to advance the disc on the field of play by passing , and score points by throwing the flying disc to a teammate in a small scoring area . [SEP]
[CLS] the game of guts was invented by the healy brothers in the 1950s and developed at the international fr ##is ##bee tournament ( if ##t ) in eagle harbor , michigan . [SEP]
[CLS] two teams of one to five team members stand in parallel lines facing each other across a court and throw flying discs at members of the opposing team . [SEP]
[CLS] a patented game scoring points by throwing and def ##le ##cting the flying disc and hitting or entering the goal . [SEP]
[CLS] the game ends when a team scores exactly 21 points or " cho ##gs " the disc for an instant win . [SEP]
[CLS] the most widely played disc game began in the late 1960s with joel silver and jared ka ##ss . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1970s it developed as an organized sport with the creation of the ultimate players association by dan rod ##dick , tom kennedy and ir ##v ka ##lb . [SEP]
[CLS] the object of the game is to advance the disc and score points by eventually passing the disc to a team member in the opposing team ' s end zone . [SEP]
[CLS] players may not run while holding the disc . [SEP]
