[CLS] ama ##las ##unt ##ha ( 495 30 april 53 ##4 / 53 ##5 ) ruled the os ##tro ##go ##ths as regent during the minority of her son from 52 ##6 to 53 ##4 and then as queen reg ##nant from 53 ##4 to 53 ##5 . [SEP]
[CLS] she was the youngest daughter of theo ##der ##ic the great , and firmly believed in the uphold ##ing of roman virtues and values . [SEP]
[CLS] she is best known for her diplomatic relationship with justin ##ian i , who invaded italy in response to her assassination . [SEP]
[CLS] in 51 ##5 , ama ##las ##unt ##ha married eu ##tha ##ric ( c . 480 52 ##2 ) , an os ##tro ##go ##th noble of the old ama ##li dynasty who had been previously living in the aria ##n kingdom of his ##pani ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] her husband was the son of wider ##ich ( born c . 450 ) , grandson of be ##ris ##mund ( born c . 410 ) , and great - grandson of thor ##ism ##und ( died after 400 ) , king of the os ##tro ##go ##ths c . 400 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was important to ama ##las ##unt ##ha ' s father , theo ##der ##ic the great , that she marry into a legitimate royal family , lest her own family ' s legitimacy be questioned . [SEP]
[CLS] she was very much an intellectual , and was well known for her extensive knowledge , which included the study of three languages , latin , greek and gothic . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , she was a student of philosophy and was said to possess the wisdom of solomon . [SEP]
[CLS] ama ##las ##unt ##ha was also described in her day as possessing all of the central roman virtues expected of a noble woman : happiness , fertility , and patience , although more emphasis was placed on her virtues within the political realm versus the feminine , something that separates her from other os ##tro ##go ##th princess ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] like most os ##tro ##go ##ths , ama ##las ##unt ##ha was an aria ##n christian . [SEP]
[CLS] eu ##tha ##ric died , apparently in the early years of his marriage to ama ##las ##unt ##ha , leaving her with two children , at ##hala ##ric and mata ##sun ##tha ( c . 51 ##7 after 550 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] on the death of her father on 30 august 52 ##6 , her son succeeded him at the age of ten , but she held the power as regent for her son . [SEP]
[CLS] her tremendous influence in her position as regent can be seen in a dip ##ty ##ch she appears in alongside her son , at ##hala ##ric , in 530 . [SEP]
[CLS] deeply im ##bu ##ed with the old roman culture , she gave to that son ' s education a more refined and literary turn than suited the ideas of her gothic subjects . [SEP]
[CLS] conscious of her unpopular ##ity she banished — and afterwards put to death — three gothic nobles whom she suspected of con ##sp ##iring against her rule . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time , she opened negotiations with the byzantine emperor justin ##ian i with the view of removing herself and the gothic treasure to constantinople . [SEP]
[CLS] her son ' s death on 2 october 53 ##4 initially made little apparent change in the state of affairs . [SEP]
[CLS] after at ##hala ##ric ' s death , ama ##las ##unt ##ha became queen , ruling alone only for a short while before making her cousin theo ##dah ##ad co - ruler ( not , as sometimes stated , her husband , for his wife was still living ) , with the intent of strengthening her position . [SEP]
[CLS] theo ##dah ##ad was a prominent leader of the gothic military aristocracy , the very group that so opposed her pro - roman stance ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] ama ##las ##unt ##ha believed this pairing would help to make supporters out of her harsh ##est critics . [SEP]
[CLS] the choice was unfortunate , for theo ##dah ##ad foster ##ed the di ##sa ##ffe ##ction of the goth ##s , and either by his orders or with his permission , ama ##las ##unt ##ha was imprisoned in the island of marta ##na in the tu ##scan lake of bo ##ls ##ena , where on 30 april in the spring of 53 ##4 / 53 ##5 she was murdered in her bath . [SEP]
[CLS] the death of ama ##las ##unt ##ha gave justin ##ian i a reason to go to war with the os ##tro ##go ##ths and attempt to take italy . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the eastern roman historian pro ##co ##pi ##us , it is believed that ama ##las ##unt ##ha and justin ##ian i had a very close diplomatic relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] more specifically , pro ##co ##pi ##us believed that ama ##las ##unt ##ha was thinking about handing over italy to justin ##ian around the time of her death . [SEP]
[CLS] shortly after ama ##las ##unt ##ha ' s murder , theo ##dah ##ad was replaced by wit ##ig ##is , ama ##las ##unt ##ha ' s son - in - law . [SEP]
[CLS] with the people ' s support , wit ##ig ##is had theo ##dah ##ad put to death . [SEP]
[CLS] the letters of cass ##io ##dor ##us , chief minister and literary adviser of ama ##las ##unt ##ha , and the histories of pro ##co ##pi ##us and jordan ##es , give us our chief information as to the character of ama ##las ##unt ##ha . [SEP]
[CLS] cass ##io ##dor ##us was a part of a greater pro - roman party that desired to romani ##ze the traditional os ##tro ##go ##thic kings ##hip , further evidence of the pro - roman circle that ama ##las ##unt ##ha surrounded herself with . [SEP]
[CLS] the life of ama ##las ##unt ##ha was made the subject of a tragedy , the first play written by the young carlo gold ##oni and presented at milan in 1733 . [SEP]
[CLS] romanian poet george co ##sb ##uc wrote a poem entitled " the queen of the os ##tro ##go ##ths " in which ama ##las ##unt ##ha speaks to theo ##dah ##ad ( named te ##oda ##t in the poem ) shortly before he kills her . [SEP]
[CLS] asteroid 650 ama ##las ##unt ##ha is named in her honour . [SEP]
