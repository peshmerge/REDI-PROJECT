[CLS] in evolutionary biology , adaptive radiation is a process in which organisms divers ##ify rapidly from an ancestral species into a multitude of new forms , particularly when a change in the environment makes new resources available , creates new challenges , or opens new environmental niche ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] starting with a recent single ancestor , this process results in the spec ##iation and ph ##eno ##typic adaptation of an array of species exhibiting different morphological and physiological traits . [SEP]
[CLS] the proto ##typical example of adaptive radiation is finch spec ##iation on the gala ##pa ##gos ( " darwin ' s finch ##es " ) , but examples are known from around the world . [SEP]
[CLS] darwin ' s finch ##es are an often - used textbook example of adaptive radiation . [SEP]
[CLS] today represented by approximately 15 species , darwin ' s finch ##es are gala ##pa ##gos endemic ##s famously adapted for a specialized feeding behavior ( although one species , the coco ##s finch ( " pin ##aro ##lo ##xia ##s in ##orn ##ata " ) , is not found in the gala ##pa ##gos but on the island of coco ##s south of costa rica ) . [SEP]
[CLS] darwin ' s finch ##es are not actually finch ##es in the true sense , but are members of the tan ##ager family th ##ra ##up ##idae , and are derived from a single ancestor that arrived in the gala ##pa ##gos from mainland south america perhaps just 3 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] excluding the coco ##s finch , each species of darwin ' s finch is generally widely distributed in the gala ##pa ##gos and fills the same niche on each island . [SEP]
[CLS] for the ground finch ##es , this niche is a diet of seeds , and they have thick bills to facilitate the consumption of these hard materials . [SEP]
[CLS] the ground finch ##es are further specialized to eat seeds of a particular size : the large ground finch ( " geo ##sp ##iza mag ##nir ##ost ##ris " ) is the largest species of darwin ' s finch and has the thick ##est beak for breaking open the tough ##est seeds , the small ground finch ( " geo ##sp ##iza fu ##li ##gin ##osa " ) has a smaller beak for eating smaller seeds , and the medium ground finch ( " geo ##sp ##iza fort ##is " ) has a beak of intermediate size for optimal consumption of intermediate ##ly sized seeds ( relative to " g . mag ##nir ##ost ##ris " and " g . fu ##li ##gin ##osa " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there is some overlap : for example , the most robust medium ground finch ##es could have beak ##s larger than those of the smallest large ground finch ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] because of this overlap , it can be difficult to tell the species apart by eye , though their songs differ . [SEP]
[CLS] these three species often occur sy ##mp ##at ##rica ##lly , and during the rainy season in the gala ##pa ##gos when food is pl ##ent ##iful , they special ##ize little and eat the same , easily accessible foods . [SEP]
[CLS] it was not well - understood why their beak ##s were so adapted until peter and rosemary grant studied their feeding behavior in the long dry season , and discovered that when food is scarce , the ground finch ##es use their specialized beak ##s to eat the seeds that they are best suited to eat and thus avoid starvation . [SEP]
[CLS] the other finch ##es in the gala ##pa ##gos are similarly uniquely adapted for their particular niche . [SEP]
[CLS] the cactus finch ##es ( " geo ##sp ##iza " sp . ) have somewhat longer beak ##s than the ground finch ##es that serve the dual purpose of allowing them to feed on op ##unt ##ia cactus nectar and pollen while these plants are flowering , but on seeds during the rest of the year . [SEP]
[CLS] the war ##bler - finch ##es ( " ce ##rth ##ide ##a " sp . ) have short , pointed beak ##s for eating insects . [SEP]
[CLS] the wood ##pe ##cker finch ( " cam ##ar ##hy ##nch ##us pal ##lid ##us " ) has a slender beak which it uses to pick at wood in search of insects ; it also uses small sticks to reach insect prey inside the wood , making it one of the few animals that use tools . [SEP]
[CLS] the mechanism by which the finch ##es initially diversified is still an area of active research . [SEP]
[CLS] one proposition is that the finch ##es were able to have a non - adaptive , all ##opa ##tric spec ##iation event on separate islands in the archipelago , such that when they rec ##on ##ver ##ged on some islands , they were able to maintain reproductive isolation . [SEP]
[CLS] once they occurred in sy ##mp ##at ##ry , niche specialization was favored so that the different species competed less directly for resources . [SEP]
[CLS] this second , sy ##mp ##at ##ric event was adaptive radiation . [SEP]
[CLS] the ha ##pl ##och ##rom ##ine ci ##ch ##lid fishes in the great lakes of the east african rift ( particularly in lake tang ##any ##ika , lake malawi , and lake victoria ) form the most spec ##ios ##e modern example of adaptive radiation . [SEP]
[CLS] these lakes are believed to be home to about 2 , 000 different species of ci ##ch ##lid , spanning a wide range of ecological roles and morphological characteristics . [SEP]
[CLS] ci ##ch ##lid ##s in these lakes fill nearly all of the roles typically filled by a large number of fish families , including those of predators , sc ##ave ##nger ##s , and herb ##ivo ##res , with varying dent ##ition ##s and head shapes to match their dietary habits . [SEP]
[CLS] in each case , the radiation events are only a few million years old , making the very high level of spec ##iation particularly remarkable . [SEP]
[CLS] several factors could be responsible for this diversity : the availability of a multitude of niche ##s probably favored specialization , as few other fish taxa are present in the lakes ( meaning that sy ##mp ##at ##ric spec ##iation was the most probable mechanism for initial specialization ) . [SEP]
[CLS] also , continual changes in the water level of the lakes during the pleistocene ( which often turned the largest lakes into several smaller ones ) could have created the conditions for secondary all ##opa ##tric spec ##iation . [SEP]
[CLS] lake tang ##any ##ika is the site from which nearly all the ci ##ch ##lid lineage ##s of east africa ( including both river ##ine and lake species ) originated . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the species in the lake constitute a single adaptive radiation event but do not form a single mono ##phy ##let ##ic clade . [SEP]
[CLS] lake tang ##any ##ika is also the least spec ##ios ##e of the three largest african great lakes , with only around 200 species of ci ##ch ##lid ; however , these ci ##ch ##lid ##s are more morphological ##ly diver ##gent and ecological ##ly distinct than their counterparts in lakes malawi and victoria , an artifact of lake tang ##any ##ika ' s older ci ##ch ##lid fauna . [SEP]
[CLS] lake tang ##any ##ika itself is believed to have formed 9 – 12 million years ago , putting a recent cap on the age of the lake ' s ci ##ch ##lid fauna . [SEP]
[CLS] many of tang ##any ##ika ' s ci ##ch ##lid ##s live very specialized lifestyle ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the giant or emperor ci ##ch ##lid ( " bo ##ule ##nger ##och ##rom ##is micro ##le ##pis " ) is a pi ##sc ##ivo ##re often ranked the largest of all ci ##ch ##lid ##s ( though it competes for this title with south america ' s " ci ##ch ##la te ##men ##sis " , the spec ##kled peacock bass ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it is thought that giant ci ##ch ##lid ##s spawn only a single time , breeding in their third year and defending their young until they reach a large size , before dying of starvation some time thereafter . [SEP]
[CLS] the three species of " alto ##lam ##pro ##log ##us " are also pi ##sc ##ivo ##res , but with lateral ##ly compressed bodies and thick scales enabling them to chase prey into thin cracks in rocks without damaging their skin . [SEP]
[CLS] " pl ##ec ##od ##us st ##rae ##len ##i " has evolved large , strangely curved teeth that are designed to scrape scales off of the sides of other fish , scales being its main source of food . [SEP]
[CLS] " g ##nath ##och ##rom ##is per ##max ##illa ##ris " possesses a large mouth with a protruding upper lip , and feeds by opening this mouth downward onto the sandy lake bottom , sucking in small invertebrates . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of tang ##any ##ika ' s ci ##ch ##lid ##s are shell - brood ##ers , meaning that mating pairs lay and fe ##rti ##li ##ze their eggs inside of empty shells on the lake bottom . [SEP]
[CLS] " lamp ##rol ##og ##us call ##ip ##ter ##us " is the most unique egg - brooding species , with 15 cm - long males ama ##ssing collections of shells and guarding them in the hopes of attracting females ( about 6 cm in length ) to lay eggs in these shells . [SEP]
[CLS] these dominant males must defend their territories from three types of rival : ( 1 ) other dominant males looking to steal shells ; ( 2 ) younger , " sneak ##er " males looking to fe ##rti ##li ##ze eggs in a dominant male ' s territory ; and ( 3 ) tiny , 2 – 4 cm " parasitic dwarf " males that also attempt to rush in and fe ##rti ##li ##ze eggs in the dominant male ' s territory . [SEP]
[CLS] these parasitic dwarf males never grow to the size of dominant males , and the male offspring of dominant and parasitic dwarf males grow with 100 % fidelity into the form of their fathers . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of other highly specialized tang ##any ##ika ci ##ch ##lid ##s exist aside from these examples , including those adapted for life in open lake water up to 200 ##m deep . [SEP]
[CLS] the ci ##ch ##lid ##s of lake malawi constitute a " species flock " of up to 1000 endemic species . [SEP]
[CLS] only seven ci ##ch ##lid species in lake malawi are not a part of the species flock : the eastern happy ( " as ##tat ##ot ##ila ##pia call ##ip ##tera " ) , the sung ##wa ( " serra ##no ##ch ##rom ##is robust ##us " ) , and five til ##ap ##ia species ( genera " ore ##och ##rom ##is " and " cop ##to ##don " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] all of the other ci ##ch ##lid species in the lake are descendants of a single original colon ##ist species , which itself was descended from tang ##any ##ika ##n ancestors . [SEP]
[CLS] the common ancestor of malawi ' s species flock is believed to have reached the lake 3 . 4 million years ago at the earliest , making malawi ci ##ch ##lid ##s ' divers ##ification into their present numbers particularly rapid . [SEP]
[CLS] malawi ' s ci ##ch ##lid ##s span a similarly range of feeding behaviors to those of tang ##any ##ika , but also show signs of a much more recent origin . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , all members of the malawi species flock are mouth - brood ##ers , meaning the female keeps her eggs in her mouth until they hatch ; in almost all species , the eggs are also fe ##rti ##lized in the female ' s mouth , and in a few species , the females continue to guard their fry in their mouth after they hatch . [SEP]
[CLS] males of most species display predominantly blue coloration when mating . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a number of particularly diver ##gent species are known from malawi , including the pi ##sc ##ivo ##rous " ni ##mbo ##ch ##rom ##is living ##ton ##ii " , which lies on its side in the substrate until small ci ##ch ##lid ##s , perhaps drawn to its broken white pattern ##ing , come to inspect the predator - at which point they are swiftly eaten . [SEP]
[CLS] lake victoria ' s ci ##ch ##lid ##s are also a species flock , once composed of some 500 or more species . [SEP]
[CLS] the deliberate introduction of the nile perch ( " late ##s ni ##lot ##icus " ) in the 1950s proved disastrous for victoria ci ##ch ##lid ##s , and the collective biomass of the victoria ci ##ch ##lid species flock has decreased substantially and an unknown number of species have become extinct . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the original range of morphological and behavioral diversity seen in the lake ' s ci ##ch ##lid fauna is still mostly present today , if endangered . [SEP]
[CLS] these again include ci ##ch ##lid ##s specialized for niche ##s across the tr ##op ##hic spectrum , as in tang ##any ##ika and malawi , but again , there are stand ##outs . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria is famously home to a large number of pi ##sc ##ivo ##rous ci ##ch ##lid species , some of which feed by sucking the contents out of mouth ##bro ##od ##ing females ' mouths . [SEP]
[CLS] victoria ' s ci ##ch ##lid ##s constitute a far younger radiation than even that of lake malawi , with estimates of the age of the flock ranging from 200 , 000 years to as little as 14 , 000 . [SEP]
[CLS] hawaii has served as the site of a number of adaptive radiation events , owing to its isolation , recent origin , and large land area . [SEP]
[CLS] the three most famous examples of these radiation ##s are presented below , though insects like the hawaiian dr ##oso ##phi ##lid flies and " h ##yp ##os ##mo ##com ##a " moths have also undergone adaptive radiation . [SEP]
[CLS] the hawaiian honey ##cre ##ep ##ers form a large , highly morphological ##ly diverse species group that began radiating in the early days of the hawaiian archipelago . [SEP]
[CLS] while today only 17 species are known to persist in hawaii ( 3 more may or may not be extinct ) , there were more than 50 species prior to poly ##nesian colonization of the archipelago ( between 18 and 21 species have gone extinct since the discovery of the islands by western ##ers ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the hawaiian honey ##cre ##ep ##ers are known for their beak ##s , which are specialized to satisfy a wide range of dietary needs : for example , the beak of the ʻ ##aki ##ap ##ola ##ʻ ##au ( " hem ##ign ##ath ##us wilson ##i " ) is characterized by a short , sharp lower man ##di ##ble for scraping bark off of trees , and the much longer , curved upper man ##di ##ble is used to probe the wood underneath for insects . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , the ʻ ##i ##ʻi ##wi ( " dr ##ep ##ani ##s co ##cci ##nea " ) has a very long curved beak for reaching nectar deep in " lobe ##lia " flowers . [SEP]
[CLS] an entire clade of hawaiian honey ##cre ##ep ##ers , the tribe psi ##tti ##ros ##tri ##ni , is composed of thick - billed , mostly seed - eating birds , like the lays ##an finch ( " tel ##es ##pi ##za can ##tan ##s " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in at least some cases , similar mor ##ph ##ologies and behaviors appear to have evolved converge ##ntly among the hawaiian honey ##cre ##ep ##ers ; for example , the short , pointed beak ##s of " lo ##x ##ops " and " ore ##omy ##stis " evolved separately despite once forming the justification for lump ##ing the two genera together . [SEP]
[CLS] the hawaiian honey ##cre ##ep ##ers are believed to have descended from a single common ancestor some 15 to 20 million years ago , though estimates range as low as 3 . 5 million years . [SEP]
[CLS] adaptive radiation is not a strictly ve ##rte ##brate phenomenon , and examples are also known from among plants . [SEP]
[CLS] the most famous example of adaptive radiation in plants is quite possibly the hawaiian silver ##sw ##ord ##s , named for alpine desert - dwelling " ar ##gy ##ro ##xi ##phi ##um " species with long , silvery leaves that live for up to 20 years before growing a single flowering stalk and then dying . [SEP]
[CLS] the hawaiian silver ##sw ##ord alliance consists of twenty - eight species of hawaiian plants which , aside from the namesake silver ##sw ##ord ##s , includes trees , shrubs , vines , cushion plants , and more . [SEP]
[CLS] the silver ##sw ##ord alliance is believed to have originated in hawaii no more than 6 million years ago , making this one of hawaii ' s youngest adaptive radiation events . [SEP]
[CLS] this means that the silver ##sw ##ord ##s evolved on hawaii ' s modern high islands , and descended from a single common ancestor that arrived on ka ##ua ##i from western north america . [SEP]
[CLS] the closest modern relatives of the silver ##sw ##ord ##s today are california tar ##weed ##s of the family as ##tera ##ceae . [SEP]
[CLS] hawaii is also the site of a separate major floral adaptive radiation event : the hawaiian lobe ##lio ##ids . [SEP]
[CLS] the hawaiian lobe ##lio ##ids are significantly more spec ##ios ##e than the silver ##sw ##ord ##s , perhaps because they have been present in hawaii for so much longer : they descended from a single common ancestor who arrived in the archipelago up to 15 million years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] today the hawaiian lobe ##lio ##ids form a clade of over 125 species , including su ##cc ##ulent ##s , trees , shrubs , ep ##ip ##hy ##tes , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] a large number of species have been lost to extinction and many of the surviving species endangered . [SEP]
[CLS] an ##ole lizards are distributed broadly in the new world , from the southeastern us to south america . [SEP]
[CLS] with over 400 species currently recognized , often placed in a single genus ( " an ##olis " ) , they constitute one of the largest radiation events among all lizards . [SEP]
[CLS] an ##ole radiation on the mainland has largely been a process of spec ##iation , and is not adaptive to any great degree , but an ##oles on each of the greater antilles ( cuba , his ##pani ##ola , puerto rico , and jamaica ) have adaptive ##ly radiated in separate , converge ##nt ways . [SEP]
[CLS] on each of these islands , an ##oles have evolved with such a consistent set of morphological adaptations that each species can be assigned to one of six " eco ##mo ##rp ##hs " : trunk – ground , trunk – crown , grass – bush , crown – giant , t ##wig , and trunk . [SEP]
[CLS] take , for example , crown – giants from each of these islands : the cuban " an ##olis lu ##te ##og ##ular ##is " , his ##pani ##ola ' s " an ##olis rico ##rdi ##i " , puerto rico ' s " an ##olis cu ##vier ##i " , and jamaica ' s " an ##olis ga ##rman ##i " ( cuba and his ##pani ##ola are both home to more than one species of crown – giant ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these an ##oles are all large , canopy - dwelling species with large heads and large lame ##lla ##e ( scales on the underside ##s of the fingers and toes that are important for traction in climbing ) , and yet none of these species are particularly closely related and appear to have evolved these similar traits independently . [SEP]
[CLS] the same can be said of the other five eco ##mo ##rp ##hs across the caribbean ' s four largest islands . [SEP]
[CLS] much like in the case of the ci ##ch ##lid ##s of the three largest african great lakes , each of these islands is home to its own converge ##nt " an ##olis " adaptive radiation event . [SEP]
[CLS] presented above are the most well - documented examples of modern adaptive radiation , but other examples are known . [SEP]
[CLS] on madagascar , birds of the family van ##gi ##dae are marked by very distinct beak shapes to suit their ecological roles . [SEP]
[CLS] mad ##aga ##scan man ##tell ##id frogs have radiated into forms that mirror other tropical frog fauna ##s , with the brightly colored man ##tell ##as ( " man ##tell ##a " ) having evolved converge ##ntly with the neo ##tropical poison dart frogs of den ##dro ##bat ##idae , while the arbor ##eal " boo ##phi ##s " species are the mad ##aga ##scan equivalent of tree frogs and glass frogs . [SEP]
[CLS] the pseudo ##xy ##rh ##op ##hi ##ine snakes of madagascar have evolved into f ##oss ##oria ##l , arbor ##eal , terrestrial , and semi - aquatic forms that converge with the col ##ub ##roid fauna ##s in the rest of the world . [SEP]
[CLS] these mad ##aga ##scan examples are significantly older than most of the other examples presented here : madagascar ' s fauna has been evolving in isolation since the island split from india some 88 million years ago , and the man ##tell ##idae originated around 50 my ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] older examples are known : the k - pg extinction event , which caused the disappearance of the dinosaurs and most other rep ##ti ##lian mega ##fa ##una 65 million years ago , is seen as having triggered a global adaptive radiation event that created the mammal diversity that exists today . [SEP]
