[CLS] the name " pokemon " is the port ##man ##tea ##u of the japanese brand " pocket monsters " . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " pokemon " , in addition to referring to the " pokemon " franchise itself , also collectively refers to the 82 ##3 fictional species that have made appearances in " pokemon " media as of the release of the seventh generation titles " pokemon " is identical in the singular and plural , as is each individual species name ; it is grammatical ##ly correct to say " one pokemon " and " many pokemon " , as well as " one pi ##ka ##chu " and " many pi ##ka ##chu " . [SEP]
[CLS] " pokemon " executive director sato ##shi ta ##ji ##ri first thought of " pokemon " , albeit with a different concept and name , around 1989 , when the game boy was released . [SEP]
[CLS] the concept of the pokemon universe , in both the video games and the general fictional world of " pokemon " , stems from the hobby of insect collecting , a popular past ##ime which ta ##ji ##ri enjoyed as a child . [SEP]
[CLS] players are designated as pokemon trainers and have three general goals : to complete the regional poked ##ex by collecting all of the available pokemon species found in the fictional region where a game takes place , to complete the national poked ##ex by transferring pokemon from other regions , and to train a team of powerful pokemon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other trainers so they may eventually win the pokemon league and become the regional champion . [SEP]
[CLS] these themes of collecting , training , and battling are present in almost every version of the pokemon franchise , including the video games , the anime and manga series , and the pokemon trading card game . [SEP]
[CLS] in most incarnation ##s of the pokemon universe , a trainer who encounters a wild pokemon is able to capture that pokemon by throwing a specially designed , mass - pro ##du ##ci ##ble spherical tool called a poke ball at it . [SEP]
[CLS] if the pokemon is unable to escape the confines of the poke ball , it is considered to be under the ownership of that trainer . [SEP]
[CLS] afterwards , it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new trainer , unless the trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the pokemon would rather act on its own accord . [SEP]
[CLS] trainers can send out any of their pokemon to wage non - lethal battles against other pokemon ; if the opposing pokemon is wild , the trainer can capture that pokemon with a poke ball , increasing their collection of creatures . [SEP]
[CLS] in " pokemon go " , and in " pokemon : let ' s go , pi ##ka ##chu ! " [SEP]
[CLS] and " let ' s go , ee ##ve ##e ! " , [SEP]
[CLS] , wild pokemon encountered by players can be caught in poke balls , but generally cannot be battled . [SEP]
[CLS] pokemon already owned by other trainers cannot be captured , except under special circumstances in certain side games . [SEP]
[CLS] if a pokemon fully defeats an opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out ( " faint ##s " ) , the winning pokemon gains experience points and may level up . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning with " pokemon x " and " y " , experience points are also gained from catching pokemon in poke balls . [SEP]
[CLS] when level ##ing up , the pokemon ' s battling apt ##itude statistics ( " stats " , such as " attack " and " speed " ) increase . [SEP]
[CLS] at certain levels , the pokemon may also learn new moves , which are techniques used in battle . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , many species of pokemon can undergo a form of meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of pokemon , a process called evolution ; this process occurs spontaneously under differing circumstances , and is itself a central theme of the series . [SEP]
[CLS] some species of pokemon may undergo a maximum of two evolutionary transformations , while others may undergo only one , and others may not evolve at all . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the pokemon pic ##hu may evolve into pi ##ka ##chu , which in turn may evolve into rai ##chu , following which no further evolution ##s may occur . [SEP]
[CLS] " pokemon x " and " y " introduced the concept of " mega evolution , " by which certain fully evolved pokemon may temporarily undergo an additional evolution into a stronger form for the purpose of battling ; this evolution is considered a special case , and unlike other evolutionary stages , it is rev ##ers ##ible . [SEP]
[CLS] in the main series , each game ' s single - player mode requires the trainer to raise a team of pokemon to defeat many non - player character ( np ##c ) trainers and their pokemon . [SEP]
[CLS] each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a specific region of the " pokemon " world for the trainer to journey through , completing events and battling opponents along the way ( including foil ##ing the plans of an ' evil ' team of pokemon trainers who serve as antagonist ##s to the player ) . [SEP]
[CLS] excluding " pokemon sun " and " moon " and " pokemon ultra sun " and " ultra moon " , the games feature eight powerful trainers , referred to as gym leaders , that the trainer must defeat in order to progress . [SEP]
[CLS] as a reward , the trainer receives a gym badge , and once all eight badges are collected , the trainer is eligible to challenge the region ' s pokemon league , where four talented trainers ( referred to collectively as the " elite four " ) challenge the trainer to four pokemon battles in succession . [SEP]
[CLS] if the trainer can overcome this gaunt ##let , they must challenge the regional champion , the master trainer who had previously defeated the elite four . [SEP]
[CLS] any trainer who wins this last battle becomes the new champion . [SEP]
[CLS] all of the licensed " pokemon " properties overseen by the pokemon company international are divided roughly by generation . [SEP]
[CLS] these generations are roughly chronological divisions by release ; every several years , when a sequel to the 1996 role - playing video games " pokemon red " and " green " is released that features new pokemon , characters , and gameplay concepts , that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise . [SEP]
[CLS] the main " pokemon " video games and their spin - offs , the anime , manga , and trading card game are all updated with the new pokemon properties each time a new generation begins . [SEP]

[CLS] a debate among fans exists over which of the two franchises came first . [SEP]

[CLS] a significant community around the " pokemon " video games ' meta ##game has existed for a long time , analyzing the best ways to use each pokemon to their full potential in competitive battles . [SEP]
[CLS] the most prolific competitive community is sm ##ogo ##n university , which has created a widely accepted tier - based battle system . [SEP]
[CLS] sm ##ogo ##n is affiliated with an online " pokemon " game called " pokemon showdown " , in which players create a team and battle against other players around the world using the competitive tier ##s created by sm ##ogo ##n . [SEP]

[CLS] if they do not succeed in capturing that pokemon , there are no second chances . [SEP]
[CLS] when a pokemon faint ##s , it is considered " dead " and must be released or stored in the pc permanently . [SEP]
