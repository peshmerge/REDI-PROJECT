[SEP]
[CLS] " pokemon " executive director sato ##shi ta ##ji ##ri first thought of " pokemon " , albeit with a different concept and name , around 1989 , when the game boy was released . [SEP]
[CLS] the concept of the pokemon universe , in both the video games and the general fictional world of " pokemon " , stems from the hobby of insect collecting , a popular past ##ime which ta ##ji ##ri enjoyed as a child . [SEP]
[CLS] players are designated as pokemon trainers and have three general goals : to complete the regional poked ##ex by collecting all of the available pokemon species found in the fictional region where a game takes place , to complete the national poked ##ex by transferring pokemon from other regions , and to train a team of powerful pokemon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other trainers so they may eventually win the pokemon league and become the regional champion . [SEP]
[CLS] these themes of collecting , training , and battling are present in almost every version of the pokemon franchise , including the video games , the anime and manga series , and the pokemon trading card game . [SEP]

[CLS] in addition , many species of pokemon can undergo a form of meta ##mo ##rp ##hosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of pokemon , a process called evolution ; this process occurs spontaneously under differing circumstances , and is itself a central theme of the series . [SEP]

[CLS] " pokemon x " and " y " introduced the concept of " mega evolution , " by which certain fully evolved pokemon may temporarily undergo an additional evolution into a stronger form for the purpose of battling ; this evolution is considered a special case , and unlike other evolutionary stages , it is rev ##ers ##ible . [SEP]
[CLS] in the main series , each game ' s single - player mode requires the trainer to raise a team of pokemon to defeat many non - player character ( np ##c ) trainers and their pokemon . [SEP]
[CLS] each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a specific region of the " pokemon " world for the trainer to journey through , completing events and battling opponents along the way ( including foil ##ing the plans of an ' evil ' team of pokemon trainers who serve as antagonist ##s to the player ) . [SEP]
[CLS] as a reward , the trainer receives a gym badge , and once all eight badges are collected , the trainer is eligible to challenge the region ' s pokemon league , where four talented trainers ( referred to collectively as the " elite four " ) challenge the trainer to four pokemon battles in succession .
