The franchise copyright is shared by all three companies, but Nintendo is the sole owner of the trademark.
The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995, and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon", which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport.
The franchise began as "Pokémon Red" and "Green" (later released outside of Japan as "Pokémon Red" and "Blue"), a pair of video games for the original Game Boy that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo in February 1996.
"Pokémon" has since gone on to become the highest-grossing media franchise of all time, with $ in total franchise revenue.
The original video game series is the second best-selling video game franchise (behind Nintendo's "Mario" franchise) with more than 340million copies sold and 1billion mobile downloads, and it spawned a hit anime television series that has become the most successful video game adaptation with over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes in 169 countries.
In addition, the "Pokémon" franchise includes the world's top-selling toy brand, the top-selling trading card game with over 27.2billion cards sold, an anime film series, a live-action film, books, manga comics, music, merchandise, and a theme park.
The franchise is also represented in other Nintendo media, such as the "Super Smash Bros." series.
In 2016, The Pokémon Company celebrated "Pokémon"' s 20th anniversary by airing an ad during Super Bowl 50 in January, issuing re-releases of "Pokémon Red" and "Blue" and the 1998 Game Boy game "Pokémon Yellow" as downloads for the Nintendo 3DS in February, and redesigning the way the games are played.
The first live-action film in the franchise, "Pokémon Detective Pikachu", based on "Detective Pikachu", was released in 2019.
The upcoming and latest games in the main series, "Pokémon Sword and Shield", are scheduled to be released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch on November 15, 2019.
The term "Pokémon", in addition to referring to the "Pokémon" franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 823 fictional species that have made appearances in "Pokémon" media as of the release of the seventh generation titles "Pokémon" is identical in the singular and plural, as is each individual species name; it is grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many Pokémon", as well as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu".
"Pokémon" executive director Satoshi Tajiri first thought of "Pokémon", albeit with a different concept and name, around 1989, when the Game Boy was released.
The concept of the Pokémon universe, in both the video games and the general fictional world of "Pokémon", stems from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which Tajiri enjoyed as a child.
Players are designated as Pokémon Trainers and have three general goals: to complete the regional Pokédex by collecting all of the available Pokémon species found in the fictional region where a game takes place, to complete the national Pokédex by transferring Pokémon from other regions, and to train a team of powerful Pokémon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers so they may eventually win the Pokémon League and become the regional Champion.
These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost every version of the Pokémon franchise, including the video games, the anime and manga series, and the Pokémon Trading Card Game.
In most incarnations of the Pokémon universe, a Trainer who encounters a wild Pokémon is able to capture that Pokémon by throwing a specially designed, mass-producible spherical tool called a Poké Ball at it.
If the Pokémon is unable to escape the confines of the Poké Ball, it is considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer.
Afterwards, it will obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pokémon would rather act on its own accord.
Trainers can send out any of their Pokémon to wage non-lethal battles against other Pokémon; if the opposing Pokémon is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pokémon with a Poké Ball, increasing their collection of creatures.
At certain levels, the Pokémon may also learn new moves, which are techniques used in battle.
In addition, many species of Pokémon can undergo a form of metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of Pokémon, a process called evolution; this process occurs spontaneously under differing circumstances, and is itself a central theme of the series.
Some species of Pokémon may undergo a maximum of two evolutionary transformations, while others may undergo only one, and others may not evolve at all.
"Pokémon X" and "Y" introduced the concept of "Mega Evolution," by which certain fully evolved Pokémon may temporarily undergo an additional evolution into a stronger form for the purpose of battling; this evolution is considered a special case, and unlike other evolutionary stages, it is reversible.
In the main series, each game's single-player mode requires the Trainer to raise a team of Pokémon to defeat many non-player character (NPC) Trainers and their Pokémon.
Each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a specific region of the "Pokémon" world for the Trainer to journey through, completing events and battling opponents along the way (including foiling the plans of an 'evil' team of Pokémon Trainers who serve as antagonists to the player).
As a reward, the Trainer receives a Gym Badge, and once all eight badges are collected, the Trainer is eligible to challenge the region's Pokémon League, where four talented trainers (referred to collectively as the "Elite Four") challenge the Trainer to four Pokémon battles in succession.
If the trainer can overcome this gauntlet, they must challenge the Regional Champion, the master Trainer who had previously defeated the Elite Four.
All of the licensed "Pokémon" properties overseen by The Pokémon Company International are divided roughly by generation.
These generations are roughly chronological divisions by release; every several years, when a sequel to the 1996 role-playing video games "Pokémon Red" and "Green" is released that features new Pokémon, characters, and gameplay concepts, that sequel is considered the start of a new generation of the franchise.
The main "Pokémon" video games and their spin-offs, the anime, manga, and trading card game are all updated with the new Pokémon properties each time a new generation begins.
"Pokémon Sword" and "Shield" will begin the eighth generation on the Nintendo Switch and are scheduled to be released in late 2019.
The anime follows the quest of the main character, Ash Ketchum (known as Satoshi in Japan), a Pokémon Master in training, as he and a small group of friends travel around the world of Pokémon along with their Pokémon partners.

The Jewish civil rights group Anti-Defamation League complained because the symbol is the reverse of a swastika, a Nazi symbol.
The cards were intended for sale in Japan only, but the popularity of "Pokémon" led to import into the United States with approval from Nintendo.
The Anti-Defamation League understood that the issue symbol was not intended to offend and acknowledged the sensitivity that Nintendo showed by removing the product.
In 1999, two nine-year-old boys from Merrick, New York sued Nintendo because they claimed the Pokémon Trading Card Game caused their problematic gambling.
In 2001, Saudi Arabia banned "Pokémon" games and the trading cards, alleging that the franchise promoted Zionism by displaying the Star of David in the trading cards (a six-pointed star is featured in the card game) as well as other religious symbols such as crosses they associated with Christianity and triangles they associated with Freemasonry; the games also involved gambling, which is in violation of Muslim doctrine.
"Pokémon" has also been accused of promoting materialism.

In November 2001, Nintendo opened a store called the Pokémon Center in New York, in Rockefeller Center, modeled after the two other Pokémon Center stores in Tokyo and Osaka and named after a staple of the video game series.
Pokémon Centers are fictional buildings where Trainers take their injured Pokémon to be healed after combat.
The store sold Pokémon merchandise on a total of two floors, with items ranging from collectible shirts to stuffed Pokémon plushies.
The store also featured a Pokémon Distributing Machine in which players would place their game to receive an egg of a Pokémon that was being given out at that time.
The store also had tables that were open for players of the Pokémon Trading Card Game to duel each other or an employee.
The store was closed and replaced by the Nintendo World Store on May 14, 2005.
Four Pokémon Center kiosks were put in malls in the Seattle area.
The Pokémon Center online store was relaunched on August 6, 2014.
Professor of Education Joseph Tobin theorizes that the success of the franchise was due to the long list of names that could be learned by children and repeated in their peer groups.
Children can pick their favourite Pokémon and affirm their individuality while at the same time affirming their conformance to the values of the group, and they can distinguish themselves from others by asserting what they liked and what they did not like from every chapter.
"Pokémon" gained popularity because it provides a sense of identity to a wide variety of children, and lost it quickly when many of those children found that the identity groups were too big and searched for identities that would distinguish them into smaller groups.
Described as "the other 'mon'" by IGN's Juan Castro, "Digimon" has not enjoyed "Pokémon"' s level of international popularity or success, but has maintained a dedicated fanbase.
The two have been noted for conceptual and stylistic similarities by sources such as GameZone.
In actuality, the first "Pokémon" media, "Pokémon Red" and "Green", were released initially on February 27, 1996; whereas the "Digimon" virtual pet was released on June 26, 1997.

A challenge called the Nuzlocke Challenge was created in order for older players of the series to enjoy "Pokémon" again—but with a twist.
The player is only allowed to capture the first Pokémon encountered in each area.
When a Pokémon faints, it is considered "dead" and must be released or stored in the PC permanently.
If the player faints, the game is considered over, and the player must restart.
There are many fan made "Pokémon" games that contain a game mode similar to the Nuzlocke Challenge, such as "Pokémon Uranium".
A study at Stanford Neurosciences published in "Nature" performed magnetic resonance imaging scans of 11 Pokemon experts and 11 controls, finding that seeing Pokemon stimulated activity in the visual cortex, in a different place than is triggered by recognizing faces, places or words, demonstrating the brain's ability to create such specialized areas.
