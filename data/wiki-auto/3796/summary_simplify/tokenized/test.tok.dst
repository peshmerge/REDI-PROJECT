[CLS] it is composed mainly in biblical hebrew , and its sept ##ua ##gin ##t is the main textual source for the christian greek old testament . [SEP]
[CLS] the first part of christian bible ##s is the greek old testament , which contains , at minimum , the above 24 books of the tan ##akh but divided into 39 books and ordered differently . [SEP]
[CLS] the second part is the greek new testament , containing 27 books ; the four canonical gospels , acts of the apostles , 21 ep ##istles or letters and the book of revelation . [SEP]
[CLS] the eastern orthodox , oriental orthodox , and assyrian christian churches may have minor differences in their lists of accepted books . [SEP]
[CLS] the king james bible — which has been called " the most influential version of the most influential book in the world , in what is now its most influential language " and which in the united states is the most used translation , being still considered a standard among protestant churches and being used liturgical ##ly in the orthodox church in america — contains 80 books : 39 in its old testament , 14 in its ap ##oc ##ry ##pha , and 27 in its new testament . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no scholarly consensus as to when the hebrew bible canon was fixed : some scholars argue that it was fixed by the has ##mon ##ean dynasty ( 140 - 40 bce ) , while others argue it was not fixed until the second century ce or even later . [SEP]
[CLS] protestants and catholics use the mas ##ore ##tic text of the jewish tan ##akh as the textual basis for their translations of the proto ##cano ##nical books ( those accepted as canonical by both jews and all christians ) , with various changes derived from a multi ##plicity of other ancient sources ( such as the sept ##ua ##gin ##t , the vu ##lga ##te , the dead sea scrolls , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] ) , while generally using the sept ##ua ##gin ##t and vu ##lga ##te , now supplemented by the ancient hebrew and aramaic manuscripts , as the textual basis for the de ##uter ##oca ##non ##ical books . [SEP]
[CLS] the eastern orthodox use the sept ##ua ##gin ##t ( translated in the 3rd century bce ) as the textual basis for the entire old testament in both proto ##cano ##nical and de ##uter ##on ##cano ##nical books — to use both in the greek for liturgical purposes , and as the basis for translations into the vernacular . [SEP]
[CLS] these books , which were largely written during the inter ##test ##ament ##al period , are called the biblical ap ##oc ##ry ##pha ( " hidden things " ) by protestants , the de ##uter ##oca ##non ( " second canon " ) by catholics , and the de ##uter ##oca ##non or " ana ##gi ##gno ##sko ##men ##a " ( " worthy of reading " ) by orthodox . [SEP]
[CLS] these are works recognized by the roman catholic , eastern orthodox , and oriental orthodox churches as being part of scripture ( and thus de ##uter ##oca ##non ##ical rather than ap ##oc ##ry ##pha ##l ) , but protestants do not recognize them as divine ##ly inspired . [SEP]
[CLS] anglican ##ism considers the ap ##oc ##ry ##pha worthy of being " read for example of life " but not to be used " to establish any doctrine . " [SEP]
[CLS] books found in both the hebrew and the greek are accepted by all denominations , and by jews , these are the proto ##cano ##nical books . [SEP]
[CLS] catholics and orthodox also accept those books present in manuscripts of the sept ##ua ##gin ##t , an ancient greek translation of the old testament with great currency among the jews of the ancient world , with the cod ##a that catholics consider 3 es ##dra ##s and 3 mac ##ca ##bee ##s ap ##oc ##ry ##pha ##l .

[CLS] daniel was written several hundred years after the time of ezra , and since that time several books of the sept ##ua ##gin ##t have been found in the original hebrew , in the dead sea scrolls , the cairo gen ##iza , and at mas ##ada , including a hebrew text of sir ##ach ( qu ##m ##ran , mas ##ada ) and an aramaic text of to ##bit ( qu ##m ##ran ) ; the additions to esther and daniel are also in their respective semitic languages . [SEP]
[CLS] the unanimous consensus of modern ( and ancient ) scholars consider several other books , including 1 mac ##ca ##bee ##s and judith , to have been composed in hebrew or aramaic . [SEP]
[CLS] opinion is divided on the book of bar ##uch , while it is acknowledged that the letter of jeremiah , the wisdom of solomon , and 2 mac ##ca ##bee ##s are originally greek compositions . [SEP]
[CLS] the table uses the spelling ##s and names present in modern editions of the bible , such as the new american bible revised edition , revised standard version and english standard version . [SEP]
[CLS] the spelling and names in both the 1609 – 1610 do ##ua ##y old testament ( and in the 158 ##2 r ##heim ##s new testament ) and the 1749 revision by bishop cha ##llon ##er ( the edition currently in print used by many catholics , and the source of traditional catholic spelling ##s in english ) and in the sept ##ua ##gin ##t differ from those spelling ##s and names used in modern editions that derive from the hebrew mas ##ore ##tic text . [SEP]
[CLS] for the catholic canon , the do ##ua ##ic titles are provided in parentheses when these differ from those editions . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , the king james version references some of these books by the traditional spelling when referring to them in the new testament , such as " esa ##ias " ( for isaiah ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the spirit of ec ##umen ##ism more recent catholic translations ( e . g . , the new american bible , jerusalem bible , and ecumenical translations used by catholics , such as the revised standard version catholic edition ) use the same " standardized " ( king james version ) spelling ##s and names as protestant bible ##s ( e . g . , 1 chronicles , as opposed to the do ##ua ##ic 1 para ##lip ##ome ##non , 1 – 2 samuel and 1 – 2 kings , instead of 1 – 4 kings ) in those books universally considered canonical — the proto ##cano ##nical ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the disputed books , included in one canon but not in others , are often called the biblical ap ##oc ##ry ##pha , a term that is sometimes used specifically to describe the books in the catholic and orthodox canons that are absent from the jewish mas ##ore ##tic text and most modern protestant bible ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] catholics , following the canon of trent ( 154 ##6 ) , describe these books as de ##uter ##oca ##non ##ical , while greek orthodox christians , following the synod of jerusalem ( 1672 ) , use the traditional name of " ana ##gi ##gno ##sko ##men ##a " , meaning " that which is to be read . " [SEP]
[CLS] they are present in a few historic protestant versions ; the german luther bible included such books , as did the english 1611 king james version . [SEP]
[CLS] several of the books in the eastern orthodox canon are also found in the appendix to the latin vu ##lga ##te , formerly the official bible of the roman catholic church . [SEP]
