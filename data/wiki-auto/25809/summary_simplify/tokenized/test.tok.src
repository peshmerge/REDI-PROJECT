[CLS] the ri ##emann zeta function or eu ##ler – ri ##emann zeta function , " ζ " ( " s " ) , is a function of a complex variable " s " that analytical ##ly continues the sum of the dir ##ich ##let series [SEP]
[CLS] which converge ##s when the real part of s is greater than 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] as a function of a real variable , leon ##hard eu ##ler first introduced and studied it in the first half of the eighteenth century without using complex analysis , which was not available at the time . [SEP]
[CLS] bernhard ri ##emann ' s 1859 article " on the number of prime ##s less than a given magnitude " extended the eu ##ler definition to a complex variable , proved its mer ##omorphic continuation and functional equation , and established a relation between its zero ##s and the distribution of prime numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] the values at negative integer points , also found by eu ##ler , are rational numbers and play an important role in the theory of modular forms . [SEP]
[CLS] the ri ##emann zeta function is defined as the analytic continuation of the function defined for " σ " > 1 by the sum of the preceding series . [SEP]
[CLS] leon ##hard eu ##ler considered the above series in 1740 for positive integer values of s , and later che ##by ##sh ##ev extended the definition to re ( " s " ) > 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] the above series is a proto ##typical dir ##ich ##let series that converge ##s absolutely to an analytic function for s such that " σ " > 1 and diver ##ges for all other values of s . [SEP]
[CLS] ri ##emann showed that the function defined by the series on the half - plane of convergence can be continued analytical ##ly to all complex values " s " = 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] for the series is the harmonic series which diver ##ges to + ∞ , and [SEP]
[CLS] thus the ri ##emann zeta function is a mer ##omorphic function on the whole complex s - plane , which is ho ##lom ##or ##phic everywhere except for a simple pole at with residue 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] where " b " is the 2 " n " th bern ##ou ##lli number . [SEP]
[CLS] for odd positive integers , no such simple expression is known , although these values are thought to be related to the algebraic k - theory of the integers ; see special values of l - functions . [SEP]
[CLS] for non ##po ##sit ##ive integers , one has [SEP]
[CLS] for " n " ≥ 0 ( using the ni ##st convention that ) [SEP]
[CLS] in particular , ζ vanish ##es at the negative even integers because for all odd m other than 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] the connection between the zeta function and prime numbers was discovered by eu ##ler , who proved the identity [SEP]
[CLS] both sides of the eu ##ler product formula converge for re ( " s " ) > 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] since the harmonic series , obtained when , diver ##ges , eu ##ler ' s formula ( which becomes [UNK] ) implies that there are infinitely many prime ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] now , for distinct prime ##s , these di ##vis ##ibility events are mutually independent because the candidate di ##vis ##ors are cop ##rim ##e ( a number is di ##vis ##ible by cop ##rim ##e di ##vis ##ors n and m if and only if it is di ##vis ##ible by nm , an event which occurs with probability ) . [SEP]
[CLS] thus the as ##ym ##pt ##otic probability that s numbers are cop ##rim ##e is given by a product over all prime ##s , [SEP]
[CLS] where γ ( " s " ) is the gamma function . [SEP]
[CLS] the equation relates values of the ri ##emann zeta function at the points s and 1 − " s " , in particular relating even positive integers with odd negative integers . [SEP]
[CLS] owing to the zero ##s of the sin ##e function , the functional equation implies that " ζ " ( " s " ) has a simple zero at each even negative integer , known as the trivial zero ##s of " ζ " ( " s " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] when s is an even positive integer , the product sin γ ( 1 − " s " ) on the right is non - zero because γ ( 1 − " s " ) has a simple pole , which cancel ##s the simple zero of the sin ##e factor . [SEP]
