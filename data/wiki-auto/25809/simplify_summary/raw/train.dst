The Riemann zeta function or Euler–Riemann zeta function, "ζ"("s") , is a function of a complex variable "s" that analytically continues the sum of the Dirichlet series
which converges when the real part of s is greater than 1.
More general representations of "ζ"("s") for all s are given below.
The Riemann zeta function plays a pivotal role in analytic number theory and has applications in physics, probability theory, and applied statistics.
As a function of a real variable, Leonhard Euler first introduced and studied it in the first half of the eighteenth century without using complex analysis, which was not available at the time.
Bernhard Riemann's 1859 article "On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude" extended the Euler definition to a complex variable, proved its meromorphic continuation and functional equation, and established a relation between its zeros and the distribution of prime numbers.
The values of the Riemann zeta function at even positive integers were computed by Euler.
The first of them, "ζ"(2) , provides a solution to the Basel problem.
In 1979 Roger Apéry proved the irrationality of "ζ"(3) .
The values at negative integer points, also found by Euler, are rational numbers and play an important role in the theory of modular forms.
Many generalizations of the Riemann zeta function, such as Dirichlet series, Dirichlet L -functions and L -functions, are known.
The Riemann zeta function "ζ"("s") is a function of a complex variable .
(The notation s , σ , and t is used traditionally in the study of the zeta function, following Riemann.)
is the gamma function.
The Riemann zeta function is defined as the analytic continuation of the function defined for "σ" > 1 by the sum of the preceding series.
Leonhard Euler considered the above series in 1740 for positive integer values of s , and later Chebyshev extended the definition to Re("s") > 1 .
The above series is a prototypical Dirichlet series that converges absolutely to an analytic function for s such that "σ" > 1 and diverges for all other values of s .
Riemann showed that the function defined by the series on the half-plane of convergence can be continued analytically to all complex values "s" ≠ 1 .
For the series is the harmonic series which diverges to +∞ , and
Thus the Riemann zeta function is a meromorphic function on the whole complex s -plane, which is holomorphic everywhere except for a simple pole at with residue 1.
where "B" is the 2"n" th Bernoulli number.
For odd positive integers, no such simple expression is known, although these values are thought to be related to the algebraic K -theory of the integers; see Special values of L -functions.
For nonpositive integers, one has
for "n" ≥ 0 (using the NIST convention that )
In particular, ζ vanishes at the negative even integers because for all odd m other than 1.
These are the so-called "trivial zeros" of the zeta function.
The connection between the zeta function and prime numbers was discovered by Euler, who proved the identity
Both sides of the Euler product formula converge for Re("s") > 1 .
The proof of Euler's identity uses only the formula for the geometric series and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
Since the harmonic series, obtained when , diverges, Euler's formula (which becomes ∏ ) implies that there are infinitely many primes.
The Euler product formula can be used to calculate the asymptotic probability that s randomly selected integers are set-wise coprime.
Intuitively, the probability that any single number is divisible by a prime (or any integer) p is .
Hence the probability that s numbers are all divisible by this prime is , and the probability that at least one of them is "not" is 1 − .
Now, for distinct primes, these divisibility events are mutually independent because the candidate divisors are coprime (a number is divisible by coprime divisors n and m if and only if it is divisible by nm , an event which occurs with probability ).
Thus the asymptotic probability that s numbers are coprime is given by a product over all primes,
where Γ("s") is the gamma function.
This is an equality of meromorphic functions valid on the whole complex plane.
The equation relates values of the Riemann zeta function at the points s and 1 − "s" , in particular relating even positive integers with odd negative integers.
Owing to the zeros of the sine function, the functional equation implies that "ζ"("s") has a simple zero at each even negative integer , known as the trivial zeros of "ζ"("s") .
When s is an even positive integer, the product sin Γ(1 − "s") on the right is non-zero because Γ(1 − "s") has a simple pole, which cancels the simple zero of the sine factor.
