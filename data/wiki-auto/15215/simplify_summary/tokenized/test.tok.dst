[CLS] internet explorer ( formerly microsoft internet explorer and windows internet explorer , commonly abbreviated ie or ms ##ie ) is a series of graphical web browser ##s developed by microsoft and included in the microsoft windows line of operating systems , starting in 1995 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was first released as part of the add - on package plus ! [SEP]
[CLS] for windows 95 that year . [SEP]
[CLS] later versions were available as free downloads , or in service packs , and included in the original equipment manufacturer ( o ##em ) service releases of windows 95 and later versions of windows . [SEP]
[CLS] the browser is discontinued , but still maintained . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer was once the most widely used web browser , attaining a peak of about 95 % usage share by 2003 . [SEP]
[CLS] this came after microsoft used bun ##dling to win the first browser war against nets ##cape , which was the dominant browser in the 1990s . [SEP]
[CLS] its usage share has since declined with the launch of fire ##fo ##x ( 2004 ) and google chrome ( 2008 ) , and with the growing popularity of operating systems such as android and ios that do not support internet explorer . [SEP]
[CLS] estimates for internet explorer ' s market share are about 2 . 28 % across all platforms or by stat ##co ##unt ##er ' s numbers ranked 7th , while on desktop , the only platform on which it has ever had significant share ( e . g . , excluding mobile and xbox ) it is ranked 4th at 5 % , after mac ##os ' s safari . [SEP]
[CLS] it manages to reach second rank after chrome when its statistics are combined with its successor , edge ( others place ie 3rd with 7 . 44 % after fire ##fo ##x ) . [SEP]
[CLS] microsoft spent over per year on internet explorer in the late 1990s , with over 1 , 000 people involved in the project by 1999 . [SEP]
[CLS] versions of internet explorer for other operating systems have also been produced , including an xbox 360 version called internet explorer for xbox and for platforms microsoft no longer supports : internet explorer for mac and internet explorer for unix ( solar ##is and hp - u ##x ) , and an embedded o ##em version called pocket internet explorer , later rebranded internet explorer mobile made for windows ce , windows phone and previously , based on internet explorer 7 for windows phone 7 . [SEP]
[CLS] on march 17 , 2015 , microsoft announced that microsoft edge would replace internet explorer as the default browser on its windows 10 devices ( while support for older windows has since been announced , as of 2019 edge still has lower share than ie ' s , that ' s in decline ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this effectively makes internet explorer 11 the last release ( however ie 8 , 9 , and 10 also receive security updates as of 2019 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer , however , remains on windows 10 and windows server 2019 primarily for enterprise purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] since january 12 , 2016 , only internet explorer 11 has been supported . [SEP]
[CLS] support varies based on the operating system ' s technical capabilities and its support life ##cycle . [SEP]
[CLS] the browser has been sc ##rut ##ini ##zed throughout its development for use of third - party technology ( such as the source code of spy ##glass mosaic , used without royalty in early versions ) and security and privacy vu ##ln ##era ##bilities , and the united states and the european union have alleged that integration of internet explorer with windows has been to the det ##rim ##ent of fair browser competition . [SEP]
[CLS] the internet explorer project was started in the summer of 1994 by thomas rear ##don , who , according to the massachusetts institute of technology review of 2003 , used source code from spy ##glass , inc . [SEP]
[CLS] mosaic , which was an early commercial web browser with formal ties to the pioneering national center for super ##com ##put ##ing applications ( nc ##sa ) mosaic browser . [SEP]
[CLS] in late 1994 , microsoft licensed spy ##glass mosaic for a quarterly fee plus a percentage of microsoft ' s non - windows revenues for the software . [SEP]
[CLS] although bearing a name similar to nc ##sa mosaic , spy ##glass mosaic had used the nc ##sa mosaic source code spa ##ring ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] the first version , dubbed microsoft internet explorer , was installed as part of the " internet jumps ##tar ##t kit " in microsoft plus ! [SEP]
[CLS] for windows 95 and plus ! . [SEP]
[CLS] the internet explorer team began with about six people in early development . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer 1 . 5 was released several months later for windows nt and added support for basic table rendering . [SEP]
[CLS] by including it free of charge with their operating system , they did not have to pay royalties to spy ##glass inc , resulting in a lawsuit and a us $ 8 million settlement on january 22 , 1997 . [SEP]
[CLS] microsoft was sued by syn ##et inc . in 1996 , over the trademark infringement . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer 11 is featured in windows 8 . 1 , which was released on october 17 , 2013 . [SEP]
[CLS] it includes an incomplete mechanism for sync ##ing tab ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a major update to its developer tools , enhanced scaling for high d ##pi screens , html ##5 pre ##ren ##der and pre ##fe ##tch , hardware - accelerated jp ##eg deco ##ding , closed capt ##ion ##ing , html ##5 full screen , and is the first internet explorer to support web ##gl and google ' s protocol spd ##y ( starting at v ##3 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this version of ie has features dedicated to windows 8 . 1 , including crypt ##ography ( web ##cr ##yp ##to ) , adaptive bit ##rate streaming ( media source extensions ) and en ##cr ##yp ##ted media extensions . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer 11 was made available for windows 7 users to download on november 7 , 2013 , with automatic updates in the following weeks . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer 11 ' s user agent string now identifies the agent as " trident " ( the underlying layout engine ) instead of " ms ##ie " . [SEP]
[CLS] it also announces compatibility with ge ##cko ( the layout engine of fire ##fo ##x ) . [SEP]
[CLS] microsoft claimed that internet explorer 11 , running the web ##kit suns ##pid ##er java ##script bench ##mark , was the fastest browser as of october 15 , 2013 . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer 11 will be made available for windows server 2012 and windows embedded 8 standard in the spring of 2019 . [SEP]
[CLS] microsoft edge , officially unveiled on january 21 , 2015 , has replaced internet explorer as the default browser on windows 10 . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer is still installed in windows 10 in order to maintain compatibility with older websites and intra ##net sites that require active ##x and other microsoft legacy web technologies . [SEP]
[CLS] according to microsoft , development of new features for internet explorer has ceased . [SEP]
[CLS] however , it will continue to be maintained as part of the support policy for the versions of windows with which it is included . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer has been designed to view a broad range of web pages and provide certain features within the operating system , including microsoft update . [SEP]
[CLS] during the hey ##day of the browser wars , internet explorer superseded nets ##cape only when it caught up technological ##ly to support the progressive features of the time . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer uses doc ##type sniffing to choose between standards mode and a " qui ##rks mode " in which it deliberately mimic ##ks non ##stand ##ard behaviour ##s of old versions of ms ##ie for html and cs ##s rendering on screen ( internet explorer always uses standards mode for printing ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it also provides its own dialect of ec ##mas ##cript called j ##script . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer was criticised by tim bern ##ers - lee for its limited support for sv ##g , which is promoted by w ##3 ##c . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer has introduced an array of proprietary extensions to many of the standards , including html , cs ##s , and the dom . [SEP]
[CLS] this has resulted in a number of web pages that appear broken in standards - compliant web browser ##s and has introduced the need for a " qui ##rks mode " to allow for rendering improper elements meant for internet explorer in these other browser ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer has introduced a number of extensions to the dom that have been adopted by other browser ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] these include the inner ##ht ##ml property , which provides access to the html string within an element ; the xml ##ht ##tp ##re ##quest object , which allows the sending of http request and receiving of http response , and may be used to perform ajax ; and the design ##mo ##de attribute of the content ##do ##cum ##ent object , which enables rich text editing of html documents . [SEP]
[CLS] some of these functional ##ities were not possible until the introduction of the w ##3 ##c dom methods . [SEP]
[CLS] its ruby character extension to html is also accepted as a module in w ##3 ##c x ##ht ##ml 1 . 1 , though it is not found in all versions of w ##3 ##c html . [SEP]
[CLS] microsoft submitted several other features of ie for consideration by the w ##3 ##c for standardization . [SEP]
[CLS] these include the ' behaviour ' cs ##s property , which connects the html elements with j ##script behaviour ##s ( known as html components , h ##tc ) ; html + time profile , which adds timing and media sync ##hr ##oni ##zation support to html documents ( similar to the w ##3 ##c x ##ht ##ml + sm ##il ) , and the v ##ml vector graphics file format . [SEP]
[CLS] however , all were rejected , at least in their original forms ; v ##ml was subsequently combined with pg ##ml ( proposed by adobe and sun ) , resulting in the w ##3 ##c - approved sv ##g format , one of the few vector image formats being used on the web , which ie did not support until version 9 . [SEP]
[CLS] other non - standard behaviour ##s include : support for vertical text , but in a syntax different from w ##3 ##c cs ##s ##3 candidate recommendation , support for a variety of image effects and page transitions , which are not found in w ##3 ##c cs ##s , support for ob ##fus ##cated script code , in particular j ##script . en ##code , as well as support for em ##bed ##ding e ##ot font ##s in web pages . [SEP]
[CLS] support for fa ##vic ##ons was first added in internet explorer 5 . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer supports fa ##vic ##ons in p ##ng , static gi ##f and native windows icon formats . [SEP]
[CLS] in windows vista and later , internet explorer can display native windows icons that have embedded p ##ng files . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer makes use of the accessibility framework provided in windows . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer is also a user interface for ft ##p , with operations similar to that of windows explorer . [SEP]
[CLS] pop - up blocking and tab ##bed brows ##ing were added respectively in internet explorer 6 and internet explorer 7 . [SEP]
[CLS] tab ##bed brows ##ing can also be added to older versions by installing ms ##n search tool ##bar or yahoo tool ##bar . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer cache ##s visited content in the temporary internet files folder to allow quicker access ( or off ##line access ) to previously visited pages . [SEP]
[CLS] the content is indexed in a database file , known as index . dat . [SEP]
[CLS] multiple index . dat files exist which index different content — visited content , web feeds , visited ur ##ls , cookies , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] prior to ie ##7 , clearing the cache used to clear the index but the files themselves were not re ##lia ##bly removed , posing a potential security and privacy risk . [SEP]
[CLS] in ie ##7 and later , when the cache is cleared , the cache files are more re ##lia ##bly removed , and the index . dat file is over ##written with null bytes . [SEP]
[CLS] ca ##ching has been improved in ie ##9 . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer is fully con ##fi ##gur ##able using group policy . [SEP]
[CLS] administrators of windows server domains ( for domain - joined computers ) or the local computer can apply and enforce a variety of settings on computers that affect the user interface ( such as di ##sa ##bling menu items and individual configuration options ) , as well as underlying security features such as download ##ing of files , zone configuration , per - site settings , active ##x control behaviour and others . [SEP]
[CLS] policy settings can be configured for each user and for each machine . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer also supports integrated windows authentication . [SEP]
[CLS] internet explorer uses a component ##ized architecture built on the component object model ( com ) technology . [SEP]
[CLS] it consists of several major components , each of which is contained in a separate dynamic - link library ( dl ##l ) and expose ##s a set of com programming interfaces hosted by the internet explorer main ex ##ec ##utable , [SEP]
