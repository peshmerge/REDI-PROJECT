Kōan is known as a "legendary emperor" among historians as his actual existence is disputed.
Kōan's reign allegedly began in 392 BC, he had one wife and two sons and reigned for more than 100 years until his death in 291 BC at the age of 136.
Emperor Kōan is traditionally accepted as the final emperor of the Jōmon period, which ended in 300 BCE.
The Japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign's historical existence, and an Imperial "misasagi" or tomb for Kōan is currently maintained; however, no extant contemporary records have been discovered that confirm a view that this historical figure actually reigned.
He is believed to be son of Emperor Kōshō; and his mother is believed to have been Yosotarashi-no-hime, who was the daughter of Okitsuyoso, and ancestress of the Owari.
Kōan was allegedly an emperor who reigned for more than a hundred years, and lived to the age of 137 (according to the Kojiki).
Kōan's reign lasted from 392 BC until his death in 291 BC, one of his sons then took the throne and would later be referred to as Emperor Kōrei.
Kōan is thus regarded by historians as a "legendary Emperor", and is considered to have been the fifth of eight Emperors without specific legends associated with them.
His name might have been regularized centuries after the lifetime ascribed to Kōan, possibly during the time in which legends about the origins of the Yamato dynasty were compiled as the chronicles known today as the "Kojiki".
One topic that has been brought up is Emperor Kōan's longevity as the oldest verified humans usually go into the mid to late 110s.
Brownlee goes on to say that while this isn't unusual for mythical figures, nobody in Japan was bothered by the longevity of the former emperors until the modern era.
While the actual site of Kōan's grave is not known, the Emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") in Tamade, Gose.
The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Kōan's mausoleum, and its formal name is "Tamate no oka no e no misasagi".
The conventionally accepted names and dates of the early Emperors were not confirmed as "traditional" though, until the reign of Emperor Kanmu between 737 and 806 AD.
