[CLS] the japanese have traditionally accepted this sovereign ' s historical existence , and an imperial " mis ##asa ##gi " or tomb for ko ##an is currently maintained ; however , no extant contemporary records have been discovered that confirm a view that this historical figure actually reigned . [SEP]
