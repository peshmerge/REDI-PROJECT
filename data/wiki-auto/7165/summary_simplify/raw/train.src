The specific meaning has evolved over time, but the modern usage usually refers to either: an image or series of images intended for satire, caricature, or humor; or a motion picture that relies on a sequence of illustrations for its animation.
Someone who creates cartoons in the first sense is called a "cartoonist", and in the second sense they are usually called an "animator".
The concept originated in the Middle Ages, and first described a preparatory drawing for a piece of art, such as a painting, fresco, tapestry, or stained glass window.
In the early 20th century, it began to refer to animated films which resembled print cartoons.
Cartoons were typically used in the production of frescoes, to accurately link the component parts of the composition when painted on damp plaster over a series of days ("giornate").
Such cartoons often have pinpricks along the outlines of the design so that a bag of soot patted or "pounced" over a cartoon, held against the wall, would leave black dots on the plaster ("pouncing").
Cartoons by painters, such as the Raphael Cartoons in London, and examples by Leonardo da Vinci, are highly prized in their own right.
This usage dates from 1843, when "Punch" magazine applied the term to satirical drawings in its pages, particularly sketches by John Leech.
The original title for these drawings was "Mr Punch's face is the letter Q" and the new title "cartoon" was intended to be ironic, a reference to the self-aggrandizing posturing of Westminster politicians.
Newspaper syndicates have also distributed single-panel gag cartoons by Mel Calman, Bill Holman, Gary Larson, George Lichty, Fred Neher and others.
Many consider "New Yorker" cartoonist Peter Arno the father of the modern gag cartoon (as did Arno himself).
The roster of magazine gag cartoonists includes Charles Addams, Charles Barsotti, and Chon Day.
Richard Thompson illustrated numerous feature articles in "The Washington Post" before creating his "Cul de Sac" comic strip.
The sports section of newspapers usually featured cartoons, sometimes including syndicated features such as Chester "Chet" Brown's "All in Sport".
Although they also employ humor, they are more serious in tone, commonly using irony or satire.
"Comic strips", also known as "cartoon strips" in the United Kingdom, are found daily in newspapers worldwide, and are usually a short series of cartoon illustrations in sequence.
Nonetheless, the creators of comic strips—as well as comic books and graphic novels—are usually referred to as "cartoonists".
Some noteworthy cartoonists of humorous comic strips are Scott Adams, Steve Bell, Charles Schulz, E. C. Segar, Mort Walker and Bill Watterson.
The pictorial satire of William Hogarth is regarded as a precursor to the development of political cartoons in 18th century England.
George Townshend produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s.
The medium began to develop in the latter part of the 18th century under the direction of its great exponents, James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson, both from London.
Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and caricature, and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon.
By calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account for their behaviour, many of Gillray's satires were directed against George III, depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of revolutionary France and Napoleon.
By the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many other countries featured cartoons commenting on the politics of the day.
His 160 cartoons relentlessly pursued the criminal characteristic of the Tweed machine in New York City, and helped bring it down.
In France under the July Monarchy, Honoré Daumier took up the new genre of political and social caricature, most famously lampooning the rotund King Louis Philippe.
Lawsuits have been very rare; the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century in Britain came in 1921, when J. H. Thomas, the leader of the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the British Communist Party.
Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of "Black Friday", when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out Miners' Federation.
Soviet-inspired communism was a new element in European politics, and cartoonists unrestrained by tradition tested the boundaries of libel law.
In Britain in the 1930s adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by DC Thomson; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about.
The story line in magazines, comic books and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were exciting and just.
It had a revolutionary design that broke away from the usual children's comics that were published broadsheet in size and not very colourful.
On some occasions, new gag cartoons have been created for book publication, as was the case with "Think Small", a 1967 promotional book distributed as a giveaway by Volkswagen dealers.
Bill Hoest and other cartoonists of that decade drew cartoons showing Volkswagens, and these were published along with humorous automotive essays by such humorists as H. Allen Smith, Roger Price and Jean Shepherd.
Because of the stylistic similarities between comic strips and early animated movies, "cartoon" came to refer to animation, and the word "cartoon" is currently used in reference to both animated cartoons and gag cartoons.
While "animation" designates any style of illustrated images seen in rapid succession to give the impression of movement, the word "cartoon" is most often used as a descriptor for television programs and short films aimed at children, possibly featuring anthropomorphized animals, superheroes, the adventures of child protagonists or related themes.
This term was popularized in 1988 by the combined live-action/animated film "Who Framed Roger Rabbit", followed in 1990 by the animated TV series "Tiny Toon Adventures".
