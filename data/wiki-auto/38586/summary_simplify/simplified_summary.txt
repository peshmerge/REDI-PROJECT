since the earliest days of esperanto , the colour green has been used as a symbol of mutual recognition , and it appears prominently in all esperanto symbols .
the " verda stelo " was first proposed in 1892 in " la esperantisto " for use as a symbol of mutual recognition among esperantists .
in 1911 , l . l . zamenhof , the creator of esperanto , wrote : " it seems to me , that my attention was drawn to the color green by mr . richard h . geoghegan and from that time i began to publish all of my works with green covers .
looking at one of my pamphlets that i had entirely by chance printed with a green cover , he pointed out that this was the color of his homeland , ireland ; at that time it came to me , that we could certainly look at that color as a symbol of hope .
at first mr . de beaufront had it imprinted on his grammar of esperanto .
the esperanto flag is composed of a green background with a white square hamas cantonization in the upper lefthand corner .
the flag was created by the esperanto club of boulogne-sur-mer .
instead , they use the jubilea simbolooooo rowland " jubilee symbol " " , two green " e " s facing each other .
this symbol was created in 1987 by a brazilian esperantist .
most esperantists , however , hold the " verda stelo " dear as a symbol of international or supranational solidarity , and regard the preference of one symbol over another as a purely personal choice .
at most esperanto congresses , all three main symbols can be seen in use on displays or being worn as badges .
other variants include that for christian esperantists , with a white christian cross superimposed on the green star , and that for leftists , with the color of the field changed from green to red .
one theory of the red star as a symbol of socialism relates to an alleged encounter between leon trotsky and nikolai krylenko .
when hearing this , he said that a similar red should be worn by soldiers of the red army .
