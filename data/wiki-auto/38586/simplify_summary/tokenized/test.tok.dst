[CLS] since the earliest days of es ##per ##anto , the colour green has been used as a symbol of mutual recognition , and it appears prominently in all es ##per ##anto symbols . [SEP]
[CLS] the " ve ##rda ste ##lo " was first proposed in an 1892 article in " la es ##per ##ant ##isto " for use as a symbol of mutual recognition among es ##per ##ant ##ists . [SEP]
[CLS] in a letter to " the british es ##per ##ant ##ist " in 1911 , l . l . za ##men ##hof , the creator of es ##per ##anto , wrote : " it seems to me , that my attention was drawn to the color green by mr . richard h . geo ##gh ##egan and from that time i began to publish all of my works with green covers . . . looking at one of my pamphlets that i had entirely by chance printed with a green cover , he pointed out that this was the color of his homeland , ireland ; at that time it came to me , that we could certainly look at that color as a symbol of hope . [SEP]
[CLS] about the five - pointed star , it seems to me , that at first mr . de beau ##front had it imprint ##ed on his grammar of es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] i liked that and i adopted it as a symbol . [SEP]
[CLS] afterward by association of ideas , the star appeared with a green color . " [SEP]
[CLS] the es ##per ##anto flag is composed of a green background with a white square ( canton ) in the upper left ##hand corner , which in turn contains a green star . [SEP]
[CLS] the green field symbol ##izes hope , the white symbol ##izes peace and neutrality , and the five - pointed star represents the five continents ( europe , america , asia , oceania , africa ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the flag was created by the es ##per ##anto club of bo ##ulo ##gne - sur - mer , initially for their own use , but was adopted as the flag of the worldwide es ##per ##anto movement by a decision of the first world es ##per ##anto congress , which took place in 1905 in that town . [SEP]
[CLS] by recommendation of the board of the universal es ##per ##anto association , the flag should have the following proportions : the ratio of the width of the flag to the height of the flag to a side of the white square should be 3 to 2 to 1 . [SEP]
[CLS] the ratio of a side of the white square to the radius of a circle en ##cl ##osing the star should be 10 to 3 . 5 . [SEP]
[CLS] some es ##per ##anto speakers consider the traditional flag too nationalist ##ic for an international language , so many organizations no longer recommend its use and , instead , use the ju ##bil ##ea sim ##bol ##o ( " jubilee symbol " , two green " e " s facing each other — or alternatively a latin - alphabet " e " facing a cyrillic - alphabet " э " , the first letter of " э ##с ##п ##е ##р ##ан ##т ##о " , the russian name for es ##per ##anto — on a white field ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this symbol was created in 1987 by a brazilian es ##per ##ant ##ist to mark the centenary of the creation of es ##per ##anto . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , this new symbol is joking ##ly called " the mel ##on " by some . [SEP]
[CLS] most es ##per ##ant ##ists , however , continue to hold the " ve ##rda ste ##lo " dear as a symbol of international or su ##pr ##ana ##tion ##al solidarity , and regard the preference of one symbol over another as a purely personal choice . [SEP]
[CLS] at most es ##per ##anto congresses , all three main symbols can be seen in use on displays or being worn as badges . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes , es ##per ##anto travelers will display the flag , wear a badge with one of the above symbols , or even wear green clothes , to make themselves known to other es ##per ##anto speakers . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1905 , delegates to the first conference of es ##per ##ant ##ists at bo ##ulo ##gne - sur - mer , unanimously approved a version , differing from the modern only by the super ##im ##position of an " e " over the green star . [SEP]
[CLS] other variants include that for christian es ##per ##ant ##ists , with a white christian cross super ##im ##posed upon the green star , and that for leftist ##s , with the color of the field changed from green to red . [SEP]
[CLS] on december 15 , 2009 , the es ##per ##anto flag flew on the google home search page " google " logo to mark l . l . za ##men ##hof ' s 150 ##th birthday . [SEP]
[CLS] the flags ##taff was the " l " of the search - company name . [SEP]
[CLS] one hypothesis of the red star as a symbol of socialism relates to an alleged encounter between leon tr ##ots ##ky and nikolai k ##ryl ##enko . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##ryl ##enko , an es ##per ##ant ##ist , was wearing a green - star lap ##el badge ; tr ##ots ##ky en ##qui ##red as to its meaning and received an explanation that each arm of the star represented one of the five traditional continents . [SEP]
[CLS] on hearing this , he specified that a similar red star should be worn by soldiers of the red army . [SEP]
