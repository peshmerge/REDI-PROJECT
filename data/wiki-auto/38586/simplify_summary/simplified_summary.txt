since the earliest days of esperanto , the colour green has been used as a symbol of mutual recognition , and it appears prominently in all esperanto symbols .
the " verda stelo " was first proposed in 1892 in " la esperantisto " for use as a symbol of mutual recognition among esperantists .
the esperanto flag is composed of a green background with a white square hamas cantonization in the upper lefthand corner .
the green field is for hope , the white symbolizes peace and neutrality .
the ratio of a side of the white square to the radius of a circle is 10 to 3.5 .
instead , they use the jubilea simbolooooo rowland " jubilee symbol " " , two green " e " s facing each other .
most esperantists , however , hold the " verda stelo " dear as a symbol of international or supranational solidarity , and regard the preference of one symbol over another as a purely personal choice .
at most esperanto congresses , all three main symbols can be seen in use on displays or being worn as badges .
sometimes , esperanto travelers will display the flag , wear a badge with one of the above symbols , or even wear green clothes , to make themselves known to other esperanto speakers .
other variants include that for christian esperantists , with a white christian cross superimposed on the green star , and that for leftists , with the color of the field changed from green to red .
on december 15,2009 , the esperanto flag was used on google 's search page " google " logo to mark l . l . zamenhof 's 150th birthday .
one theory of the red star as a symbol of socialism relates to an alleged encounter between leon trotsky and nikolai krylenko .
when hearing this , he said that a similar red should be worn by soldiers of the red army .
