[CLS] la scala ( , , ] ; abbreviation in italian language for the official name ] ) is an opera house in milan , italy . [SEP]
[CLS] the theatre was inaugurated on 3 august 1778 and was originally known as the " " ( new royal - duc ##al theatre alla scala ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the premiere performance was antonio sal ##ieri ' s " europa rico ##nos ##ci ##uta " . [SEP]
[CLS] most of italy ' s greatest operatic artists , and many of the finest singers from around the world , have appeared at la scala . [SEP]
[CLS] the theatre is regarded as one of the leading opera and ballet theatres in the world and is home to the la scala theatre chorus , la scala theatre ballet and la scala theatre orchestra . [SEP]
[CLS] the theatre also has an associate school , known as the la scala theatre academy , which offers professional training in music , dance , stage craft and stage management . [SEP]
[CLS] la scala ' s season opens on 7 december , saint ambrose ' s day , the feast day of milan ' s patron saint . [SEP]
[CLS] all performances must end before midnight , and long operas start earlier in the evening when necessary . [SEP]
[CLS] the museo tea ##tral ##e alla scala ( la scala theatre museum ) , accessible from the theatre ' s foyer and a part of the house , contains a collection of paintings , drafts , statues , costumes , and other documents regarding la scala ' s and opera history in general . [SEP]
[CLS] la scala also hosts the acc ##ade ##mia d ' art ##i e me ##sti ##eri dell ##o sp ##etta ##col ##o ( academy for the performing arts ) . [SEP]
[CLS] its goal is to train a new generation of young musicians , technical staff , and dancers ( at the sc ##uo ##la di ball ##o del teatro alla scala , one of the academy ' s divisions ) . [SEP]
[CLS] above the boxes , la scala has a gallery — called the " log ##gio ##ne " — where the less wealthy can watch the performances . [SEP]
[CLS] the gallery is typically crowded with the most critical opera afi ##cion ##ados , known as the log ##gio ##nist ##i , who can be ec ##static or mer ##ci ##less towards singers ' perceived successes or failures . [SEP]
[CLS] for their failures , artists receive a " baptism of fire " from these afi ##cion ##ados , and fia ##sco ##s are long remembered . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in 2006 , tenor roberto ala ##gna left the stage after being boo ##ed during a performance of " aid ##a " . [SEP]
[CLS] this forced his under ##st ##udy , anton ##ello palo ##mb ##i , to quickly replace him mid - scene without time to change into a costume . [SEP]
[CLS] a fire destroyed the previous theatre , the teatro reg ##io duc ##ale , on 25 february 1776 , after a carnival gala . [SEP]
[CLS] a group of ninety wealthy milan ##ese , who owned private boxes in the theatre , wrote to archduke ferdinand of austria - este asking for a new theatre and a provisional one to be used while completing the new one . [SEP]
[CLS] the neoclassical architect giuseppe pier ##mar ##ini produced an initial design but it was rejected by count firm ##ian ( the governor of the then austrian lombardy ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a second plan was accepted in 1776 by empress maria theresa . [SEP]
[CLS] the new theatre was built on the former location of the church of santa maria alla scala , from which the theatre gets its name . [SEP]
[CLS] the church was deco ##nse ##crat ##ed and demolished and , over a period of two years , the theatre was completed by pietro mar ##lian ##i , pietro nose ##tti and antonio and giuseppe fe . [SEP]
[CLS] the theatre had a total of " 3 , 000 or so " seats organized into 67 ##8 pit - stalls , arranged in six tier ##s of boxes above which is the ' log ##gio ##ne ' or two galleries . [SEP]
[CLS] its stage is one of the largest in italy ( 16 . 15 ##m d x 20 . 4 ##m w x 26 ##m h ) . [SEP]
[CLS] building expenses were covered by the sale of boxes , which were lavish ##ly decorated by their owners , impress ##ing observers such as ste ##nd ##hal . [SEP]
[CLS] la scala ( as it came to be known ) soon became the pre ##emi ##nent meeting place for noble and wealthy milan ##ese people . [SEP]
[CLS] in the tradition of the times , the main floor had no chairs and spectators watched the shows standing up . [SEP]
[CLS] the orchestra was in full sight , as the orchestra pit had not yet been built . [SEP]
[CLS] as with most of the theatres at that time , la scala was also a casino , with gamble ##rs sitting in the foyer . [SEP]
[CLS] conditions in the auditorium , too , could be frustrating for the opera lover , as mary shelley discovered in september 1840 : at the opera they were giving otto nicola ##i ' s " templar ##io " . [SEP]
[CLS] unfortunately , as is well known , the theatre of la scala serves , not only as the universal drawing - room for all the society of milan , but every sort of trading transaction , from horse - dealing to stock - job ##bing , is carried on in the pit ; so that brief and far between are the snatch ##es of melody one can catch . [SEP]
[CLS] la scala was originally illuminated with 84 oil lamps mounted on the stage and another thousand in the rest of theatre . [SEP]
[CLS] to prevent the risks of fire , several rooms were filled with hundreds of water bucket ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in time , oil lamps were replaced by gas lamps , these in turn were replaced by electric lights in 1883 . [SEP]
[CLS] the original structure was renovated in 1907 , when it was given its current layout with 1 , 98 ##7 seats . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1943 , during world war ii , la scala was severely damaged by bombing . [SEP]
[CLS] it was rebuilt and reopened on 11 may 1946 , with a memorable concert conducted by arturo to ##scan ##ini — twice la scala ' s principal conductor and an associate of the composers giuseppe verdi and giacomo pu ##cci ##ni — with a soprano solo by ren ##ata te ##baldi , which created a sensation . [SEP]
[CLS] la scala hosted the first productions of many famous operas , and had a special relationship with verdi . [SEP]
[CLS] for several years , however , verdi did not allow his work to be played here , as some of his music had been modified ( he said " corrupted " ) by the orchestra . [SEP]
[CLS] this dispute originated in a disagreement over the production of his " gi ##ova ##nna d ' arc ##o " in 1845 ; however the composer later conducted his " requiem " there on 25 may 1874 and he announced in 1886 that la scala would host the premiere of what was to become his penultimate opera , " ot ##ello " . [SEP]
[CLS] the premiere of his last opera , " fa ##ls ##taff " was also given in the theatre . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1982 , the fi ##lar ##mon ##ica della scala was established , drawing its members from the larger pool of musicians that comprise the orchestra della scala . [SEP]
[CLS] the theatre underwent a major renovation from early 2002 to late 2004 . [SEP]
[CLS] the theatre closed following the traditional 7 december 2001 season opening performances of " ot ##ello " , which ran through december . [SEP]
[CLS] from 19 january 2002 to november 2004 , the opera company transferred to the new teatro de ##gli arc ##im ##bold ##i , built in the pi ##relli - bi ##co ##cca industrial area 4 . 5 mi from the city centre . [SEP]
[CLS] the renovation by architect mario bot ##ta proved controversial , as preservation ##ists feared that historic details would be lost . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the opera company was satisfied with the improvements to the structure and the sound quality , which was enhanced when the heavy red carpets in the hall were removed . [SEP]
[CLS] the stage was entirely rebuilt , and an enlarged backstage allows more sets to be stored , permitting more productions . [SEP]
[CLS] seats now include monitors for the electronic libretto system provided by radio marco ##ni , an italian company , allowing audiences to follow opera libre ##tti in english and italian in addition to the original language . [SEP]
[CLS] the opera house re - opened on 7 december 2004 with a production , conducted by ric ##card ##o mu ##ti , of sal ##ieri ' s " europa rico ##nos ##ci ##uta " , the opera performed at la scala ' s inauguration in 1778 . [SEP]
[CLS] tickets for the re - opening fetch ##ed up to € ##2 , 000 . [SEP]
[CLS] the renovations cost a reported € ##6 ##1 million , and left a budget short ##fall that the opera house overcame in 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] carlo fontana , the general manager of la scala since 1990 , was dismissed in february 2005 by the board of governors over differences with the music director , ric ##card ##o mu ##ti . [SEP]
[CLS] the resulting staff backlash caused serious disruption ##s and staff strikes . [SEP]
[CLS] in a statement , the theatre ' s board said it was " urgent to un ##ify the theatre ' s management " . [SEP]
[CLS] on 16 march 2005 , the la scala orchestra and other staff overwhelmingly approved a no - confidence motion against mu ##ti , and demanded the resignation of fontana ' s replacement , ma ##uro mel ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] mu ##ti had already been forced to cancel a concert a few days earlier because of the disagreements . [SEP]
[CLS] italy ' s culture minister , gi ##ulia ##no urban ##i , supported the conductor but called for urgent action by management to safeguard the smooth operation and prestige of la scala . [SEP]
[CLS] on 2 april 2005 , mu ##ti resigned from la scala , citing " hostility " from staff members . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 2005 , stephane li ##ss ##ner , formerly head of the aix - en - provence festival , was appointed general manager and artistic director of la scala , becoming the first non - italian in its history to hold the office . [SEP]
[CLS] on 15 may 2006 , daniel bare ##nb ##oi ##m was named " maestro sc ##ali ##ger ##o " , or " de facto " principal guest conductor , of the company . [SEP]
[CLS] in october 2011 , bare ##nb ##oi ##m was appointed the next music director of la scala , effective december 2011 , with an initial contract of 5 years . [SEP]
[CLS] in december 2013 , management named ric ##card ##o cha ##illy the next music director of la scala , effective 1 january 2015 . [SEP]
