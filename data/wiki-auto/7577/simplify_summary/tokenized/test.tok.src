[CLS] the history of the soviet union from 1982 through 1991 spans the period from leonid br ##ez ##hn ##ev ' s death and funeral until the dissolution of the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] due to the years of soviet military build ##up at the expense of domestic development , economic growth st ##ag ##nated . [SEP]
[CLS] failed attempts at reform , a stands ##till economy , and the success of the united states against the soviet union ' s forces in the war in afghanistan led to a general feeling of discontent , especially in the baltic republics and eastern europe . [SEP]
[CLS] greater political and social freedoms , instituted by the last soviet leader and general secretary , mikhail go ##rba ##chev , created an atmosphere of open criticism of the communist regime . [SEP]
[CLS] the dramatic drop of the price of oil in 1985 and 1986 profoundly influenced actions of the soviet leadership . [SEP]
[CLS] nikolai ti ##kh ##ono ##v , the chairman of the council of ministers , was succeeded by nikolai ry ##zh ##kov , and va ##sil ##i ku ##z ##nets ##ov , the acting chairman of the pre ##si ##dium of the supreme soviet , was succeeded by andrei gr ##omy ##ko , the former minister of foreign affairs . [SEP]
[CLS] several republics began resisting central control , and increasing democrat ##ization led to a weakening of the central government . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet union finally collapsed in 1991 when boris ye ##lts ##in seized power in the aftermath of a failed coup that had attempted to top ##ple reform - minded go ##rba ##chev . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1982 , the st ##ag ##nation of the soviet economy was obvious , as evidenced by the fact that the soviet union had been import ##ing grain from the u . s . throughout the 1970s , but the system was so firmly en ##tre ##nched that any real change seemed impossible . [SEP]
[CLS] a huge rate of defense spending consumed large parts of the economy . [SEP]
[CLS] the transition period that separated the br ##ez ##hn ##ev and go ##rba ##chev eras resembled the former much more than the latter , although hints of reform emerged as early as 1983 . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##ez ##hn ##ev died on 10 november 1982 . [SEP]
[CLS] two days passed between his death and the announcement of the election of yuri and ##rop ##ov as the new general secretary , suggesting to many outsiders that a power struggle had occurred in the k ##rem ##lin . [SEP]
[CLS] and ##rop ##ov maneuver ##ed his way into power both through his kgb connections and by gaining the support of the military by promising not to cut defense spending . [SEP]
[CLS] for comparison , some of his rivals such as konstantin cher ##nen ##ko were skeptical of a continued high military budget . [SEP]
[CLS] aged 69 , he was the oldest person ever appointed as general secretary and 11 years older than br ##ez ##hn ##ev when he acquired that post . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 1983 , he assumed the post of chairman of the pre ##si ##dium of the supreme soviet , thus becoming the ceremonial head of state . [SEP]
[CLS] it had taken br ##ez ##hn ##ev 13 years to acquire this post . [SEP]
[CLS] and ##rop ##ov began a thorough house - cleaning throughout the party and state bureaucracy , a decision made easy by the fact that the central committee had an average age of 69 . [SEP]
[CLS] he replaced more than one - fifth of the soviet ministers and regional party first secretaries and more than one - third of the department heads within the central committee apparatus . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , he replaced the aging leadership with younger , more vigorous administrators . [SEP]
[CLS] but and ##rop ##ov ' s ability to res ##ha ##pe the top leadership was constrained by his own age and poor health and the influence of his rival ( and longtime ally of leonid br ##ez ##hn ##ev ) konstantin cher ##nen ##ko , who had previously supervised personnel matters in the central committee . [SEP]
[CLS] the transition of power from br ##ez ##hn ##ev to and ##rop ##ov was notably the first one in soviet history to occur completely peacefully with no one being imprisoned , killed , or forced from office . [SEP]
[CLS] and ##rop ##ov ' s domestic policy leaned heavily towards restoring discipline and order to soviet society . [SEP]
[CLS] he es ##che ##wed radical political and economic reforms , promoting instead a small degree of can ##dor in politics and mild economic experiments similar to those that had been associated with the late premier alexei ko ##sy ##gin ' s initiatives in the mid - 1960s . [SEP]
[CLS] in tandem with such economic experiments , and ##rop ##ov launched an anti - corruption drive that reached high into the government and party ranks . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike br ##ez ##hn ##ev , who possessed several mansions and a fleet of luxury cars , he lived quite simply . [SEP]
[CLS] while visiting budapest in early 1983 , he expressed interest in hungary ' s go ##ula ##sh communism and that the sheer size of the soviet economy made strict top - down planning imp ##rac ##tical . [SEP]
[CLS] changes were needed in a hurry for 1982 had witnessed the country ' s worst economic performance since world war ii , with real gdp growth at almost zero percent . [SEP]
[CLS] and ##rop ##ov faced a series of foreign policy cr ##ise : the hopeless situation of the soviet army in afghanistan , threatened revolt in poland , growing an ##imo ##sity with china , the polar ##ization threat of war in the middle east , troubles in ethiopia and south africa . [SEP]
[CLS] the most critical threat was the " second cold war " launched by american president ronald reagan and a specific attack on rolling back what he denounced as the " evil empire " . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan was using american economic power , and soviet economic weakness , to es ##cala ##te massive spending on the cold war , emphasizing high technology that moscow lacked . [SEP]
[CLS] the main response was raising the military budget to 70 percent of the national budget , and supplying billions of dollars worth of military aid to syria , iraq , libya , south yemen , the pl ##o , cuba , and north korea . [SEP]
[CLS] that included tanks and armored troop carriers , hundreds of fighter planes , as well as anti - aircraft systems , artillery systems , and all sorts of high tech equipment for which the ussr was the main supplier for its allies . [SEP]
[CLS] and ##rop ##ov ' s main goal was to avoid an open war . [SEP]
[CLS] in foreign policy , the conflict in afghanistan continued even though and ##rop ##ov — who now felt the invasion was a mistake — half - hearted ##ly explored options for a negotiated withdrawal . [SEP]
[CLS] and ##rop ##ov ' s rule was also marked by deterioration of relations with the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] during a much - publicized " walk in the woods " with soviet dig ##ni ##tary yu ##li kv ##its ##insky , american diplomat paul ni ##tze suggested a compromise for reducing nuclear missiles in europe on both sides that was ultimately ignored by the pol ##it ##buro . [SEP]
[CLS] kv ##its ##insky would later write that , despite his own efforts , the soviet leadership was not interested in compromise , instead calculating that peace movements in the west would force the americans to cap ##it ##ulate . [SEP]
[CLS] on 8 march 1983 , during and ##rop ##ov ' s reign as general secretary , u . s . president ronald reagan famously labeled the soviet union an " evil empire " . [SEP]
[CLS] the same month , on 23 march , reagan announced the strategic defense initiative . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan claimed this research program into ballistic missile defense would be " consistent with our obligations under the ab ##m treaty " . [SEP]
[CLS] however , and ##rop ##ov was dismiss ##ive of this claim , and said that " it is time they washington stopped . . . searching for the best ways of un ##lea ##shing nuclear war . [SEP]
[CLS] . . . engaging in this is not just ir ##res ##pon ##sible . [SEP]
[CLS] in august 1983 , and ##rop ##ov made an announcement that the country was stopping all work on space - based weapons . [SEP]
[CLS] one of his most notable acts was in response to a letter from a 10 - year - old american child from maine named samantha smith , inviting her to the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] she came but and ##rop ##ov ' s severe illness was made public when he was too ill to see her . [SEP]
[CLS] meanwhile , soviet – u . s . arms control talks on intermediate - range nuclear weapons in europe were suspended by the soviet union in november 1983 and by the end of the year , the soviets had broken off all arms control negotiations . [SEP]
[CLS] massive bad publicity worldwide came when soviet fighters shot down a civilian jet liner , korean air flight ka ##l - 00 ##7 , which carried 269 passengers and crew . [SEP]
[CLS] it had stray ##ed over the soviet union on 1 september 1983 on its scheduled route from anchorage , alaska , to seoul , south korea . [SEP]
[CLS] and ##rop ##ov kept secret the fact that the soviet union held in its possession the black box from ka ##l 00 ##7 which proved the pilot had made a ty ##po ##graphic ##al error when entering data in the automatic pilot . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet system was un ##pre ##par ##ed to deal with a civilian airline ##r , and the shooting down was a matter of following orders without question . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of admitting an accident , soviet media proclaimed a brave decision to meet a western pro ##vocation . [SEP]
[CLS] together with its low credibility explanation in 1986 of the melt ##down of the nuclear reactor at cher ##nob ##yl , the episode demonstrated an inability to deal with public relations crises ; the propaganda system was only aimed at people who already were committed friends of the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] both crises were escalated by technological and organizational failures , compound ##ed by human error [SEP]
[CLS] us ##− ##sov ##ie ##t relations deteriorated rapidly especially after march 1983 , when reagan dubbed the soviet union an " evil empire " . [SEP]
[CLS] the official press agency ta ##ss accused reagan of " thinking only in terms of confrontation and bell ##ico ##se , lunatic anti - communism " . [SEP]
[CLS] further soviet outrage was directed at reagan ' s station ##ing of intermediate - range nuclear missiles in western europe . [SEP]
[CLS] in afghanistan , angola , nicaragua and elsewhere , under the reagan doctrine , the us began under ##mini ##ng soviet - supported governments by supplying arms to anti - communist resistance movements in these countries . [SEP]
[CLS] president reagan ' s decision to deploy medium - range per ##shing ii missiles in western europe met with mass protests in countries such as france and west germany , sometimes numbering 1 million people at a time . [SEP]
[CLS] many europeans became convinced that the us and not the soviet union was the more aggressive country , and there was fear over the prospect of a war , especially since there was a widespread conviction in europe that the us , being separated from the red army by two oceans as opposed to a short land border , was ins ##ens ##itive to the people of germany and other countries . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , the memory of world war ii was still strong and many germans could not forget the destruction and mass rape ##s committed by soviet troops in the closing days of that conflict . [SEP]
[CLS] this attitude was helped along by the reagan administration ' s comments that a war between nato and the warsaw pact would not necessarily result in the use of nuclear weapons . [SEP]
[CLS] and ##rop ##ov ' s health declined rapidly during the tense summer and fall of 1983 , and he became the first soviet leader to miss the anniversary celebrations of the 1917 revolution that november . [SEP]
[CLS] he died in february 1984 of kidney failure after disappearing from public view for several months . [SEP]
[CLS] his most significant legacy to the soviet union was his discovery and promotion of mikhail go ##rba ##chev . [SEP]
[CLS] beginning in 1978 , go ##rba ##chev advanced in two years through the k ##rem ##lin hierarchy to full membership in the pol ##it ##buro . [SEP]
[CLS] his responsibilities for the appointment of personnel allowed him to make the contacts and distribute the favors necessary for a future bid to become general secretary . [SEP]
[CLS] at this point , western experts believed that and ##rop ##ov was groom ##ing go ##rba ##chev as his successor . [SEP]
[CLS] however , although go ##rba ##chev acted as a deputy to the general secretary throughout and ##rop ##ov ' s illness , go ##rba ##chev ' s time had not yet arrived when his patron died early in 1984 . [SEP]
[CLS] at 71 , konstantin cher ##nen ##ko was in poor health , suffering from em ##phy ##se ##ma , and unable to play an active role in policy making when he was chosen , after lengthy discussion , to succeed and ##rop ##ov . [SEP]
[CLS] but cher ##nen ##ko ' s short time in office did bring some significant policy changes . [SEP]
[CLS] the personnel changes and investigations into corruption undertaken under and ##rop ##ov ' s tu ##tel ##age came to an end . [SEP]
[CLS] cher ##nen ##ko advocated more investment in consumer goods and services and in agriculture . [SEP]
[CLS] he also called for a reduction in the cp ##su ' s micro ##mana ##gement of the economy and greater attention to public opinion . [SEP]
[CLS] however , kgb repression of soviet di ##ssi ##dents also increased . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 1983 , soviet representatives withdrew from the world psychiatric organization in protest of that group ' s continued complaints about the use of psychiatry to suppress dissent . [SEP]
[CLS] this policy was under ##lined in june when vladimir dan ##chev , a broadcaster for radio moscow , referred to the soviet troops in afghanistan as " invaders " while conducting english - language broadcasts . [SEP]
[CLS] after refusing to re ##tra ##ct this statement , he was sent to a mental institution for several months . [SEP]
[CLS] vale ##ry send ##ero ##v , a leader of an unofficial union of professional workers , was sentenced to seven years in a labor camp early in the year for speaking out on discrimination practiced against jews in education and the professions . [SEP]
[CLS] although cher ##nen ##ko had called for renewed " det ##ente " with the west , little progress was made towards closing the rift in east ##− ##west relations during his rule . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet union boycott ##ed the 1984 summer olympics in los angeles , re ##tal ##iating for the united states - led boycott of the 1980 summer olympics in moscow . [SEP]
[CLS] in september 1984 , the soviet union also prevented a visit to west germany by east german leader erich hon ##eck ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] fighting in the afghan democratic republic also intensified , but in the late autumn of 1984 the united states and the soviet union did agree to resume arms control talks in early 1985 . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to the fl ##ailing economy , the prolonged war in afghanistan , often referred to as the soviet union ' s " vietnam war " , led to increased public dissatisfaction with the communist regime . [SEP]
[CLS] also , the cher ##nob ##yl disaster in 1986 added motive force to go ##rba ##chev ' s g ##las ##nos ##t and pere ##st ##roi ##ka reforms , which eventually spiral ##ed out of control and caused the soviet system to collapse . [SEP]
[CLS] after years of st ##ag ##nation , the " new thinking " of younger communist app ##arat ##chi ##k began to emerge . [SEP]
[CLS] following the death of terminal ##ly ill konstantin cher ##nen ##ko , the pol ##it ##buro elected mikhail go ##rba ##chev to the position of general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union ( cp ##su ) in march 1985 . [SEP]
[CLS] at 54 , go ##rba ##chev was the youngest person since joseph stalin to become general secretary and the country ' s first head of state born a soviet citizen instead of a subject of the tsar . [SEP]
[CLS] during his official confirmation on march 11 , foreign minister andrei gr ##omy ##ko spoke of how the new soviet leader had filled in for cher ##nen ##ko as cc secretariat , and praised his intelligence and flexible , pr ##ag ##matic ideas instead of rigid adherence to party ideology . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##rba ##chev was aided by a lack of serious competition in the pol ##it ##buro . [SEP]
[CLS] he immediately began appointing younger men of his generation to important party posts , including nikolai ry ##zh ##kov , secretary of economics , viktor cher ##bri ##kov , kgb chief , foreign minister eduard she ##vard ##nad ##ze ( replacing the 75 - year - old gr ##omy ##ko ) , secretary of defense industries , and secretary of construction boris ye ##lts ##in . [SEP]
[CLS] removed from the pol ##it ##buro and secretariat was gr ##igo ##ry romano ##v , who had been go ##rba ##chev ' s most significant rival for the position of general secretary . [SEP]
[CLS] gr ##omy ##ko ' s removal as foreign minister was the most unexpected change given his decades of un ##fl ##in ##ching , faithful service compared to the unknown , inexperienced she ##vard ##nad ##ze . [SEP]
[CLS] more predict ##ably , the 80 - year - old nikolai ti ##kh ##ono ##v , the chairman of the council of ministers , was succeeded by nikolai ry ##zh ##kov , and va ##sil ##i ku ##z ##nets ##ov , the acting chairman of the pre ##si ##dium of the supreme soviet , was succeeded by andrei gr ##omy ##ko , the former minister of foreign affairs . [SEP]
[CLS] further down the chain , up to 40 % of the first secretaries of the " oblast ##s " ( provinces ) were replaced with younger , better educated , and more competent men . [SEP]
[CLS] the defense establishment was also given a thorough shake ##up with the commanders of all 16 military districts replaced along with all theaters of military operation , as well as the three soviet fleets . [SEP]
[CLS] not since world war ii had the soviet military had such a rapid turnover of officers . [SEP]
[CLS] sixty - eight - year - old marshal nikolai og ##ark ##ov was fully rehab ##ili ##tated after having fallen from favor in 1983 – 84 due to his handling of the ka ##l 00 ##7 shoot ##down and his ideas about improving soviet strategic and tactical doctrines were made into an official part of defense policy , although some of his other ambitions such as developing the military into a smaller , tighter force based on advanced technology were not considered feasible for the time being . [SEP]
[CLS] many , but not all , of the younger army officers appointed during 1985 were protege ##s of og ##ark ##ov . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##rba ##chev got off to an excellent start during his first months in power . [SEP]
[CLS] he projected an aura of youth and d ##yna ##mism compared to his aged predecessors and made frequent walks in the streets of the major cities answering questions from ordinary citizens . [SEP]
[CLS] he became the first leader that spoke with the soviet people in person . [SEP]
[CLS] when he made public speeches , he made clear that he was interested in constructive exchanges of ideas instead of merely rec ##iting lengthy pl ##ati ##tu ##des about the excellence of the soviet system . [SEP]
[CLS] he also spoke candi ##dly about the slack ##ness and run - down condition of soviet society in recent years , blaming alcohol abuse , poor workplace discipline , and other factors for these situations . [SEP]
[CLS] alcohol was a particular na ##g of go ##rba ##chev ' s , especially as he himself did not drink , and he made one of his major policy aims curb ##ing the consumption of it . [SEP]
[CLS] in terms of foreign policy , the most important one , relations with the united states , remained twitch ##y through 1985 . [SEP]
[CLS] in october , go ##rba ##chev made his first visit to a non - communist country when he traveled to france and was warmly received . [SEP]
[CLS] the fashion - conscious french were also capt ##ivated by his wife rai ##sa and political pun ##dit ##s widely believed that the comparatively young soviet leader would have a pr advantage over president reagan , who was 20 years his senior . [SEP]
[CLS] reagan and go ##rba ##chev met for the first time in geneva in november . [SEP]
[CLS] the three weeks preceding the summit meeting were marked by an unprecedented soviet media campaign against the strategic defense initiative ( sd ##i ) , taking advantage of opposition at home in the us to the program . [SEP]
[CLS] when it finally took place , the two super ##power leaders established a solid rap ##port that bo ##ded well for the future despite reagan ' s refusal to compromise on abandonment of sd ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] a joint com ##mun ##ique by both parties stated that they were in agreement that nuclear war could not be won by either side and must never be allowed to happen . [SEP]
[CLS] it was also agreed that reagan and go ##rba ##chev would carry out two more summit meetings in 1986 – 87 . [SEP]
[CLS] jimmy carter had decisive ##ly ended the policy of det ##ente , by financially aiding the mu ##jah ##ide ##en movement in neighboring socialist afghanistan , which served as a pre ##text for the soviet intervention in afghanistan six months later , with the aims of supporting the afghan government , controlled by the people ' s democratic party of afghanistan . [SEP]
[CLS] tensions between the super ##power ##s increased during this time , when carter placed trade em ##bar ##go ##es on the soviet union and stated that the soviet invasion of afghanistan was " the most serious threat to the peace since the second world war . " [SEP]
[CLS] east - west tensions increased during the first term of u . s . president ronald reagan ( 1981 – 85 ) , reaching levels not seen since the cuban missile crisis as reagan increased us military spending to 7 % of the gdp . [SEP]
[CLS] to match the usa ' s military build ##up , the soviet union increased its own military spending to 27 % of its gdp and froze production of civilian goods at 1980 levels , causing a sharp economic decline in the already failing soviet economy . [SEP]
[CLS] the us financed the training for the mu ##jah ##ide ##en warlord ##s such as ja ##lal ##uddin ha ##q ##qa ##ni , gu ##lb ##udi ##n he ##km ##at ##yar and bu ##rh ##anu ##ddin ra ##bba ##ni eventually culminated to the fall of the soviet satellite the democratic republic of afghanistan . [SEP]
[CLS] while the cia and mi ##6 and the people ' s liberation army of china financed the operation along with the pakistan government against the soviet union , eventually the soviet union began looking for a withdrawal route and in 1988 the geneva accord ##s were signed between communist - afghanistan and the islamic republic of pakistan ; under the terms soviet troops were to withdraw . [SEP]
[CLS] once the withdrawal was complete the pakistan is ##i continued to support the mu ##jah ##ide ##en against the communist government and by 1992 , the government collapsed . [SEP]
[CLS] us president reagan also actively hind ##ered the soviet union ' s ability to sell natural gas to europe whilst simultaneously actively working to keep gas prices low , which kept the price of soviet oil low and further starved the soviet union of foreign capital . [SEP]
[CLS] this " long - term strategic offensive , " which " contrasts with the essentially reactive and defensive strategy of " containment " , accelerated the fall of the soviet union by encouraging it to over ##ex ##ten ##d its economic base . [SEP]
[CLS] the proposition that special operations by the cia in saudi arabia affected the prices of soviet oil was ref ##uted by marshall goldman — one of the leading experts on the economy of the soviet union — in his latest book . [SEP]
[CLS] he pointed out that the saudi ##s decreased their production of oil in 1985 ( it reached a 16 - year low ) , whereas the peak of oil production was reached in 1980 . [SEP]
[CLS] they increased the production of oil in 1986 , reduced it in 1987 with a subsequent increase in 1988 , but not to the levels of 1980 when production reached its highest level . [SEP]
[CLS] the real increase happened in 1990 , by which time the cold war was almost over . [SEP]
[CLS] in his book he asked why , if saudi arabia had such an effect on soviet oil prices , did prices not fall in 1980 when the production of oil by saudi arabia reached its highest level — three times as much oil as in the mid - eighties — and why did the saudi ##s wait till 1990 to increase their production , five years after the cia ' s supposed intervention ? [SEP]
[CLS] why didn ' t the soviet union collapse in 1980 then ? [SEP]
[CLS] by the time go ##rba ##chev ushered in the process that would lead to the di ##sman ##tling of the soviet administrative command economy through his programs of " us ##kor ##eni ##ye " ( speed - up of economic development ) and " pere ##st ##roi ##ka " ( political and economic restructuring ) announced in 1986 , the soviet economy suffered from both hidden inflation and per ##vas ##ive supply shortages aggravated by an increasingly open black market that undermine ##d the official economy . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , the costs of super ##power status — the military , space program , subsidies to client states — were out of proportion to the soviet economy . [SEP]
[CLS] the new wave of industrial ##ization based upon information technology had left the soviet union desperate for western technology and credits in order to counter its increasing backward ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] the law on cooperative ##s enacted in may 1986 was perhaps the most radical of the economic reforms during the early part of the go ##rba ##chev era . [SEP]
[CLS] for the first time since vladimir lenin ' s new economic policy , the law permitted private ownership of businesses in the services , manufacturing , and foreign - trade sectors . [SEP]
[CLS] under this provision , cooperative restaurants , shops , and manufacturers became part of the soviet scene . [SEP]
[CLS] " g ##las ##nos ##t " resulted in greater freedom of speech and the press becoming far less controlled . [SEP]
[CLS] thousands of political prisoners and many di ##ssi ##dents were also released . [SEP]
[CLS] soviet social science became free to explore and publish on many subjects that had previously been off limits , including conducting public opinion polls . [SEP]
[CLS] the all ##− ##uni ##on center for public opinion research ( vc ##iom ) — the most prominent of several polling organizations that were started then — was opened . [SEP]
[CLS] state archives became more accessible , and some social statistics that had been kept secret became open for research and publication on sensitive subjects such as income di ##spar ##ities , crime , suicide , abortion , and infant mortality . [SEP]
[CLS] the first center for gender studies was opened within a newly formed institute for the socio ##− ##economic study of human population . [SEP]
[CLS] in january 1987 , go ##rba ##chev called for democrat ##ization : the in ##fusion of democratic elements such as multi - candidate elections into the soviet political process . [SEP]
[CLS] a 1987 conference convened by soviet economist and go ##rba ##chev adviser leonid aba ##lk ##in , concluded : " deep transformations in the management of the economy cannot be realized without corresponding changes in the political system . " [SEP]
[CLS] in june 1988 , at the cp ##su ' s nineteenth party conference , go ##rba ##chev launched radical reforms meant to reduce party control of the government apparatus . [SEP]
[CLS] on 1 december 1988 , the supreme soviet amended the soviet constitution to allow for the establishment of a congress of people ' s deputies as the soviet union ' s new supreme legislative body . [SEP]
[CLS] elections to the new congress of people ' s deputies were held throughout the ussr in march and april 1989 . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##rba ##chev , as general secretary of the communist party , could be forced to resign at any moment if the communist elite became dissatisfied with him . [SEP]
[CLS] to proceed with reforms opposed by the majority of the communist party , go ##rba ##chev aimed to consolidate power in a new position , president of the soviet union , which was independent from the cp ##su and the soviets ( councils ) and whose holder could be imp ##ea ##ched only in case of direct violation of the law . [SEP]
[CLS] on 15 march 1990 , go ##rba ##chev was elected as the first executive president . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time , article 6 of the constitution was changed to de ##pr ##ive the cp ##su of a monopoly on political power . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##rba ##chev ' s efforts to stream ##line the communist system offered promise , but ultimately proved un ##con ##tro ##lla ##ble and resulted in a cascade of events that eventually concluded with the dissolution of the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] initially intended as tools to bo ##lster the soviet economy , the policies of " pere ##st ##roi ##ka " and " g ##las ##nos ##t " soon led to un ##int ##ended consequences . [SEP]
[CLS] relaxation under " g ##las ##nos ##t " resulted in the communist party losing its absolute grip on the media . [SEP]
[CLS] before long , and much to the embarrassment of the authorities , the media began to expose severe social and economic problems the soviet government had long denied and actively concealed . [SEP]
[CLS] problems receiving increased attention included poor housing , alcoholism , drug abuse , pollution , outdated stalin - era factories , and petty to large - scale corruption , all of which the official media had ignored . [SEP]
[CLS] media reports also exposed crimes committed by joseph stalin and the soviet regime , such as the gu ##lag ##s , his treaty with adolf hitler , and the great purge ##s , which had been ignored by the official media . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , the ongoing war in afghanistan , and the mis ##hand ##ling of the 1986 cher ##nob ##yl disaster , further damaged the credibility of the soviet government at a time when dissatisfaction was increasing . [SEP]
[CLS] in all , the positive view of soviet life long presented to the public by the official media was rapidly fading , and the negative aspects of life in the soviet union were brought into the spotlight . [SEP]
[CLS] this undermine ##d the faith of the public in the soviet system and eroded the communist party ' s social power base , threatening the identity and integrity of the soviet union itself . [SEP]
[CLS] fray ##ing amongst the members of the warsaw pact countries and instability of its western allies , first indicated by le ##ch wa ##ł ##esa ' s 1980 rise to leadership of the trade union solidarity , accelerated , leaving the soviet union unable to depend upon its eastern european satellite states for protection as a buffer zone . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1989 , following his doctrine of " new political thinking " , go ##rba ##chev had rep ##udi ##ated the br ##ez ##hn ##ev doctrine in favor of non - intervention in the internal affairs of its warsaw pact allies ( " sinatra doctrine " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] gradually , each of the warsaw pact countries saw their communist governments fall to popular elections and , in the case of romania , a violent uprising . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1990 , the governments of bulgaria , czechoslovakia , east germany , hungary , poland and romania , all of which had been imposed after world war ii , were brought down as revolutions swept eastern europe . [SEP]
[CLS] the soviet union also began experiencing up ##hea ##val as the political consequences of " g ##las ##nos ##t " rev ##er ##ber ##ated throughout the country . [SEP]
[CLS] despite efforts at containment , the up ##hea ##val in eastern europe inevitably spread to nationalities within the ussr . [SEP]
[CLS] in elections to the regional assemblies of the soviet union ' s constituent republics , nationalists as well as radical reformer ##s swept the board . [SEP]
[CLS] as go ##rba ##chev had weakened the system of internal political repression , the ability of the ussr ' s central moscow government to impose its will on the ussr ' s constituent republics had been largely undermine ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] massive peaceful protests in the baltic republics such as the baltic way and the singing revolution drew international attention and bo ##lster ##ed independence movements in various other regions . [SEP]
[CLS] the rise of nationalism under " freedom of speech " soon re - awakened sim ##mering ethnic tensions in various soviet republics , further disc ##red ##iting the ideal of a unified soviet people . [SEP]
[CLS] one instance occurred in february 1988 , when the government in na ##gor ##no - kara ##ba ##kh , a predominantly ethnic armenian region in the azerbaijan ssr , passed a resolution calling for unification with the armenian ssr . [SEP]
[CLS] violence against local azerbaijani ##s was reported on soviet television , pro ##voking massacre ##s of armenians in the azerbaijani city of sum ##gai ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] em ##bold ##ened by the liberal ##ized atmosphere of " g ##las ##nos ##t " , public dissatisfaction with economic conditions was much more over ##t than ever before in the soviet period . [SEP]
[CLS] although " pere ##st ##roi ##ka " was considered bold in the context of soviet history , go ##rba ##chev ' s attempts at economic reform were not radical enough to restart the country ' s chronic ##ally slug ##gis ##h economy in the late 1980s . [SEP]
[CLS] the reforms made some in ##ro ##ads in decent ##ral ##ization , but go ##rba ##chev and his team left intact most of the fundamental elements of the stalin ##ist system , including price controls , inc ##on ##vert ##ibility of the rub ##le , exclusion of private property ownership , and the government monopoly over most means of production . [SEP]
[CLS] the value of all consumer goods manufactured in 1990 in retail prices was about 45 ##9 billion rub ##les ( $ 2 . 1 trillion ) . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , the soviet government had lost control over economic conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] government spending increased sharply as an increasing number of un ##pro ##fi ##table enterprises required state support and consumer price subsidies to continue . [SEP]
[CLS] tax revenues declined as republic and local governments with ##held tax revenues from the central government under the growing spirit of regional autonomy . [SEP]
[CLS] the anti ##− ##al ##co ##hol campaign reduced tax revenues as well , which in 1982 accounted for about 12 % of all state revenue . [SEP]
[CLS] the elimination of central control over production decisions , especially in the consumer goods sector , led to the breakdown in traditional supplier ##− ##pro ##du ##cer relationships without contributing to the formation of new ones . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , instead of stream ##lining the system , go ##rba ##chev ' s decent ##ral ##ization caused new production bottle ##neck ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the dissolution of the soviet union ' was a process of systematic di ##sin ##te ##gration , which occurred in the economy , social structure and political structure . [SEP]
[CLS] it resulted in the abolition of the soviet federal government ( " the union center " ) and independence of the ussr ' s republics on 26 december 1991 . [SEP]
[CLS] the process was caused by a weakening of the soviet government , which led to di ##sin ##te ##gration and took place from about 19 january 1990 to 26 december 1991 . [SEP]
[CLS] the process was characterized by many of the republics of the soviet union declaring their independence and being recognized as sovereign nation - states . [SEP]
[CLS] " go ##rba ##chev actually put the sort of final blow to the resistance of the soviet union by killing the fear of the people . [SEP]
[CLS] it was still that this country was governed and kept together , as a structure , as a government structure , by the fear from stalin ##ist times . " [SEP]
[CLS] the principal elements of the old soviet political system were communist party dominance , the hierarchy of soviets , state socialism , and ethnic federal ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] go ##rba ##chev ' s programs of " pere ##st ##roi ##ka " ( restructuring ) and " g ##las ##nos ##t " ( open ##ness ) produced radical un ##for ##ese ##en effects that brought that system down . [SEP]
[CLS] as a means of rev ##iving the soviet state , go ##rba ##chev repeatedly attempted to build a coalition of political leaders supportive of reform and created new arenas and bases of power . [SEP]
[CLS] he implemented these measures because he wanted to resolve serious economic problems and political in ##ert ##ia that clearly threatened to put the soviet union into a state of long - term st ##ag ##nation . [SEP]
[CLS] but by using structural reforms to widen opportunities for leaders and popular movements in the union republics to gain influence , go ##rba ##chev also made it possible for nationalist , orthodox communist , and pop ##uli ##st forces to oppose his attempts to liberal ##ize and rev ##ital ##ize soviet communism . [SEP]
[CLS] although some of the new movements as ##pired to replace the soviet system altogether with a liberal democratic one , others demanded independence for the national republics . [SEP]
[CLS] still others insisted on the restoration of the old soviet ways . [SEP]
[CLS] ultimately , go ##rba ##chev could not forge a compromise among these forces and the consequence was the dissolution of the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] to rest ##ru ##cture the soviet administrative command system and implement a transition to a market economy , ye ##lts ##in ' s shock program was employed within days of the dissolution of the soviet union . [SEP]
[CLS] the subsidies to money - losing farms and industries were cut , price controls abolished , and the rub ##le moved towards convert ##ibility . [SEP]
[CLS] new opportunities for ye ##lts ##in ' s circle and other entrepreneurs to seize former state property were created , thus restructuring the old state - owned economy within a few months . [SEP]
[CLS] after obtaining power , the vast majority of " ideal ##istic " reformer ##s gained huge possessions of state property using their positions in the government and became business ol ##iga ##rch ##s in a manner that appeared anti ##the ##tical to an emerging democracy . [SEP]
[CLS] existing institutions were conspicuous ##ly abandoned prior to the establishment of new legal structures of the market economy such as those governing private property , overseeing financial markets , and enforcing taxation . [SEP]
[CLS] market economists believed that the di ##sman ##tling of the administrative command system in russia would raise gdp and living standards by all ##ocating resources more efficiently . [SEP]
[CLS] they also thought the collapse would create new production possibilities by eliminating central planning , sub ##stituting a decent ##ral ##ized market system , eliminating huge macro ##economic and structural distortion ##s through liberal ##ization , and providing incentives through privatization . [SEP]
[CLS] since the ussr ' s collapse , russia faced many problems that free market proponents in 1992 did not expect . [SEP]
[CLS] among other things , 25 % of the population lived below the poverty line , life expect ##ancy had fallen , birth ##rates were low , and the gdp was hal ##ved . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a sharp increase in economic inequality between 1988 / 1989 and 1993 / 1995 , with the gin ##i ratio increasing by an average of 9 points for all former socialist countries . [SEP]
[CLS] these problems led to a series of crises in the 1990s , which nearly led to the election of ye ##lts ##in ' s communist challenger , gen ##nad ##y z ##yu ##gano ##v , in the 1996 presidential election . [SEP]
[CLS] in recent years , the economy of russia has begun to improve greatly , due to major investments and business development and also due to high prices of natural resources . [SEP]
