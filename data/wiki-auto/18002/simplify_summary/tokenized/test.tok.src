[CLS] al ##cott ' s early education included lessons from the naturalist henry david thor ##eau who inspired her to write " thor ##eau ' s flute " based on her time at walden ' s pond . [SEP]

[CLS] at one point in 1857 , unable to find work and filled with such despair , al ##cott contemplated suicide . [SEP]

[CLS] in 1858 , her younger sister elizabeth died , and her older sister anna married a man named john pratt . [SEP]

[CLS] her letters homer ##ev ##ised and published in the boston anti - slavery paper " commonwealth " and collected as " hospital sketches " ( 1863 , republished with additions in 1869 ) brought her first critical recognition for her observations and humor . [SEP]
[CLS] she wrote about the mis ##mana ##gement of hospitals and the indifference and call ##ous ##ness of some of the surgeons she encountered . [SEP]
[CLS] her main character , tri ##bula ##tion per ##i ##win ##kle , showed a passage from innocence to maturity and is a " serious and el ##o ##quent witness " . [SEP]
[CLS] her novel " moods " ( 1864 ) , based on her own experience , was also promising . [SEP]
[CLS] after her service as a nurse , al ##cott ' s father wrote her a heart ##felt poem titled " to louisa may al ##cott . [SEP]

[CLS] al ##cott originally delayed writing the novel , seeing herself incapable of writing a story for girls , despite her publisher , thomas nile ##s ' urges for her to do so . [SEP]
[CLS] part two , or " part second " , also known as " good wives " ( 1869 ) , followed the march sisters into adulthood and marriage . [SEP]
[CLS] " little men " ( 1871 ) detailed jo ' s life at the plum ##field school that she founded with her husband professor b ##hae ##r at the conclusion of part two of " little women " . [SEP]
[CLS] " jo ' s boys " ( 1886 ) completed the " march family saga " . [SEP]
[CLS] in " little women " , al ##cott based her heroine " jo " on herself . [SEP]

[CLS] however , al ##cott ' s romance while in europe with the young polish man lad ##is ##las " lad ##die " wi ##s ##nie ##wski was detailed in her journals but then deleted by al ##cott herself before her death . [SEP]
[CLS] al ##cott identified lad ##die as the model for laurie in " little women " . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , every character seems to be parallel ##ed to some extent , from beth ' s death mirror ##ing lizzie ' s to jo ' s rivalry with the youngest , amy , as al ##cott felt a sort of rivalry for ( abigail ) may , at times . [SEP]
[CLS] though al ##cott never married , she did take in may ' s daughter , louisa , after may ' s death in 1879 from child ##bed fever , caring for little " lulu " until her death . [SEP]
[CLS] " little women " was well received , with critics and audiences finding it suitable for many age groups . [SEP]
[CLS] a reviewer of " eclectic magazine " called it " the very best of books to reach the hearts of the young of any age from six to sixty " . [SEP]
[CLS] it was a fresh , natural representation of daily life . [SEP]
[CLS] with the success of " little women " , al ##cott shi ##ed away from the attention and would sometimes act as a servant when fans would come to her house . [SEP]
[CLS] along with elizabeth st ##od ##dar ##d , rebecca harding davis , anne mon ##cure crane , and others , al ##cott was part of a group of female authors during the gilded age , who addressed women ' s issues in a modern and candi ##d manner . [SEP]
[CLS] their works were , as one newspaper columnist of the period commented , " among the decided ' signs of the times ' " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1877 al ##cott was one of the founders of the women ' s educational and industrial union in boston . [SEP]
[CLS] after her youngest sister may died in 1879 , louisa took over for the care of niece , lulu , who was named after louisa . [SEP]
[CLS] al ##cott suffered chronic health problems in her later years , including vertigo . [SEP]
[CLS] she and her earliest biographer ##s attributed her illness and death to mercury poisoning . [SEP]
[CLS] during her american civil war service , al ##cott contracted ty ##ph ##oid fever and was treated with a compound containing mercury . [SEP]
[CLS] recent analysis of al ##cott ' s illness , however , suggests that her chronic health problems may have been associated with an auto ##im ##mun ##e disease , not mercury exposure . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , a late portrait of al ##cott shows a rash on her cheeks , which is a characteristic of lu ##pus . [SEP]
[CLS] al ##cott died of a stroke at age 55 in boston , on march 6 , 1888 , two days after her father ' s death . [SEP]
[CLS] lulu , her niece was only 8 years old when louisa died . [SEP]

[CLS] louisa frequently wrote in her journals about going on runs up until she died . [SEP]
[CLS] she challenged the social norms regarding gender by encouraging her young female readers to run as well . [SEP]
[CLS] her boston home is featured on the boston women ' s heritage trail . [SEP]
[CLS] her childhood home orchard house is now a museum that pays homage to louisa may al ##cott and her family that focuses on education . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , harriet rei ##sen wrote " louisa may al ##cott : the woman behind " little women " " which later became a film that was directed by nancy porter and aired on pbs television . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1996 al ##cott was inducted into the national women ' s hall of fame . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a part second of " little women " , also known as " good wives " , published in 1869 ; and afterward published together with " little women " . [SEP]
