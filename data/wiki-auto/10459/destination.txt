Emperor Ingyō (允恭天皇, "Ingyō-tennō") was the 19th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
Historians consider details about the life of Emperor Ingyō to be possibly legendary, but probable.
The name Ingyō"-tennō" was created for him posthumously by later generations.
No certain dates can be assigned to this emperor's life or reign.
The conventionally accepted names and sequence of the early emperors were not to be confirmed as "traditional" until the reign of Emperor Kammu, who was the 50th monarch of the Yamato dynasty.
The "Kojiki" and "Nihon Shoki" record that Ingyō was the fourth son of Emperor Nintoku.
He was the younger brother of Emperor Hanzei.
Ingyō made one of his brothers his heir, but this plan did not unfold as planned.
Instead, his brother's sons would attain the throne.
Ingyō would be followed by his nephews, Emperor Ankō and Emperor Yūryaku.
Very little is known about the events of Ingyō's life and reign.
Only limited information is available for study prior to the reign of the 29th monarch, Emperor Kimmei.
The earliest recorded earthquake in Japan was in 416.
The Imperial Palace in Kyoto was destroyed.
This emperor's official name after his death (his posthumous name) was regularized many centuries after the lifetime which was ascribed to Ingyō.
According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus ("kofun").
Ingyō is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine ("misasagi") in Fujiidera, which is a city near Osaka.
