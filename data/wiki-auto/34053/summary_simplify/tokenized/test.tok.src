[CLS] a water turbine is a rotary machine that converts kinetic energy and potential energy of water into mechanical work . [SEP]
[CLS] water turbines were developed in the 19th century and were widely used for industrial power prior to electrical grid ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] now they are mostly used for electric power generation . [SEP]
[CLS] water turbines are mostly found in dams to generate electric power from water kinetic energy . [SEP]
[CLS] the migration from water wheels to modern turbines took about one hundred years . [SEP]
[CLS] the word turbine was introduced by the french engineer claude bu ##rdi ##n in the early 19th century and is derived from the greek word " τ ##υ ##ρ ##β ##η " for " w ##hir ##ling " or a " vortex " . [SEP]
[CLS] the main difference between early water turbines and water wheels is a swirl component of the water which passes energy to a spinning rotor . [SEP]
[CLS] this additional component of motion allowed the turbine to be smaller than a water wheel of the same power . [SEP]
[CLS] they could process more water by spinning faster and could harness much greater heads . [SEP]
[CLS] two helix - turbine mill sites of almost identical design were found at che ##mt ##ou and test ##our , modern - day tunisia , dating to the late 3rd or early 4th century ad . [SEP]
[CLS] the water from the mill - race entered the pit tangent ##ial ##ly , creating a swirling water column which made the fully submerged wheel act like a true turbine . [SEP]
[CLS] johann se ##gne ##r developed a reactive water turbine ( se ##gne ##r wheel ) in the mid - 18th century in kingdom of hungary . [SEP]
[CLS] se ##gne ##r worked with eu ##ler on some of the early mathematical theories of turbine design . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 18th century , a dr . robert barker invented a similar reaction hydraulic turbine that became popular as a lecture - hall demonstration . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1844 , ur ##iah a . boyd ##en developed an outward flow turbine that improved on the performance of the four ##ney ##ron turbine . [SEP]
[CLS] the francis turbine is also called a radial flow turbine , since water flows from the outer ci ##rc ##um ##ference towards the centre of runner . [SEP]
[CLS] inward flow water turbines have a better mechanical arrangement and all modern reaction water turbines are of this design . [SEP]
[CLS] water pressure decreases to atmospheric , or in some cases sub ##at ##mos ##pher ##ic , as the water passes through the turbine blades and loses energy . [SEP]
[CLS] it was an evolution of the francis turbine and revolution ##ized the ability to develop low - head hydro sites . [SEP]
[CLS] all common water machines until the late 19th century ( including water wheels ) were basically reaction machines ; water " pressure " head acted on the machine and produced work . [SEP]
[CLS] inspired by the high pressure jet systems used in hydraulic mining in the gold fields , knight developed a bucket ##ed wheel which captured the energy of a free jet , which had converted a high head ( hundreds of vertical feet in a pipe or pens ##tock ) of water to kinetic energy . [SEP]
[CLS] the water ' s velocity , roughly twice the velocity of the bucket periphery , does a u - turn in the bucket and drops out of the runner at low velocity . [SEP]
[CLS] pe ##lton had been quite an effective promoter of his design and although do ##ble took over the pe ##lton company he did not change the name to do ##ble because it had brand name recognition . [SEP]
[CLS] flowing water is directed on to the blades of a turbine runner , creating a force on the blades . [SEP]
[CLS] reaction turbines are acted on by water , which changes pressure as it moves through the turbine and gives up its energy . [SEP]
[CLS] they must be en ##cased to contain the water pressure ( or su ##ction ) , or they must be fully submerged in the water flow . [SEP]
[CLS] it is largely used in dam and large power plants [SEP]
[CLS] impulse turbines change the velocity of a water jet . [SEP]
[CLS] since the turbine is spinning , the force acts through a distance ( work ) and the diverted water flow is left with diminished energy . [SEP]
[CLS] an impulse turbine is one in which the pressure of the fluid flowing over the rotor blades is constant and all the work output is due to the change in kinetic energy of the fluid . [SEP]
[CLS] prior to hitting the turbine blades , the water ' s pressure ( potential energy ) is converted to kinetic energy by a no ##zzle and focused on the turbine . [SEP]
[CLS] no pressure change occurs at the turbine blades , and the turbine doesn ' t require a housing for operation . [SEP]
[CLS] newton ' s second law describes the transfer of energy for impulse turbines . [SEP]
[CLS] they can reverse flow and operate as a pump to fill a high reservoir during off - peak electrical hours , and then rev ##ert to a water turbine for power generation during peak electrical demand . [SEP]
[CLS] this type of system is used in el hi ##er ##ro , one of the canary islands : " when wind production exceeds demand , excess energy will pump water from a lower reservoir at the bottom of a volcanic cone to an upper reservoir at the top of the volcano 700 meters above sea level . [SEP]
[CLS] when demand rises and there is not enough wind power , the water will be released to four hydroelectric turbines with a total capacity of 11 mw . " [SEP]
[CLS] in general , impulse turbines are used for high head sites , and reaction turbines are used for low head sites . [SEP]
[CLS] kaplan turbines with adjustable blade pitch are well - adapted to wide ranges of flow or head conditions , since their peak efficiency can be achieved over a wide range of flow conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] very large francis and kaplan machines usually have vertical shafts because this makes best use of the available head , and makes installation of a generator more economical . [SEP]
[CLS] this also allows for the use of a smaller turbine runner , which can decrease costs and mechanical losses . [SEP]
[CLS] the specific speed formula _ 8 of a turbine character ##izes the turbine ' s shape in a way that is not related to its size . [SEP]
[CLS] a miniature replica of a proposed design , about one foot ( 0 . 3 m ) in diameter , can be tested and the laboratory measurements applied to the final application with high confidence . [SEP]
[CLS] affinity laws are derived by requiring simi ##lit ##ude between the test model and the application . [SEP]
[CLS] flow through the turbine is controlled either by a large valve or by wicket gates arranged around the outside of the turbine runner . [SEP]
[CLS] differential head and flow can be plotted for a number of different values of gate opening , producing a hill diagram used to show the efficiency of the turbine at varying conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] the turbine will be designed to survive the mechanical forces of this speed . [SEP]
[CLS] different designs of governors have been used since the mid - 18th century to control the speeds of the water turbines . [SEP]
[CLS] in early fly ##ball systems , the fly ##ball component countered by a spring acted directly to the valve of the turbine or the wicket gate to control the amount of water that enters the turbines . [SEP]
[CLS] an early mechanical governor is a ser ##vo ##me ##chan ##ism that comprises a series of gears that use the turbine ' s speed to drive the fly ##ball and turbine ' s power to drive the control mechanism . [SEP]
[CLS] the mechanical governors were continued to be enhanced in power amp ##li ##fication through the use of gears and the dynamic behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] by 1930 , the mechanical governors had many parameters that could be set on the feedback system for precise controls . [SEP]
[CLS] in the later part of the twentieth century , electronic governors and digital systems started to replace the mechanical governors . [SEP]
[CLS] in the electronic governors , also known as second - generation governors , the fly ##ball was replaced by rotational speed sensor but the controls were still done through analog systems . [SEP]
[CLS] in the modern systems , also known as third - generation governors , the controls are performed digitally by algorithms that are programmed to the computer of the governor . [SEP]
[CLS] given that the turbine blades in a water turbine are constantly exposed to water and dynamic forces , they need to have high corrosion resistance and strength . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common material used in over ##lay ##s on carbon steel runners in water turbines are austen ##itic steel alloys that have 17 % to 20 % ch ##rom ##ium to increase stability of the film which improves a ##que ##ous corrosion resistance . [SEP]
[CLS] the ch ##rom ##ium content in these steel alloys exceed the minimum of 12 % ch ##rom ##ium required to exhibit some atmospheric corrosion resistance . [SEP]
[CLS] having a higher ch ##rom ##ium concentration in the steel alloys allows for a much longer lifespan of the turbine blades . [SEP]
[CLS] currently , the blades are made of mart ##ens ##itic stainless steel ##s which have high strength compared to austen ##itic stainless steel ##s by a factor of 2 . [SEP]
[CLS] besides corrosion resistance and strength as the criteria for material selection , we ##ld - ability and density of the turbine blade . [SEP]
[CLS] selecting a material with low density is important to achieve higher efficiency because the lighter blades rotate more easily . [SEP]
[CLS] the ss ( 13 ##cr - 4 ##ni ) has been shown to have improved erosion resistance at all angles of attack through the process of laser harden ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] it is important to minimize erosion in order to maintain high e ##ffi ##cie ##ncies because erosion negatively impacts the hydraulic profile of the blades which reduces the relative ease to rotate . [SEP]
[CLS] turbines are designed to run for decades with very little maintenance of the main elements ; overhaul intervals are on the order of several years . [SEP]
[CLS] damaged areas are cut or ground out , then welded back up to their original or an improved profile . [SEP]
[CLS] old turbine runners may have a significant amount of stainless steel added this way by the end of their lifetime . [SEP]
[CLS] other elements requiring inspection and repair during overhaul ##s include bearings , packing box and shaft sleeves , ser ##vo ##moto ##rs , cooling systems for the bearings and generator coil ##s , seal rings , wicket gate link ##age elements and all surfaces . [SEP]
[CLS] water turbines are generally considered a clean power producer , as the turbine causes essentially no change to the water . [SEP]
[CLS] historically there have also been negative consequences , mostly associated with the dams normally required for power production . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , native american tribes in the pacific northwest had livelihood ##s built around salmon fishing , but aggressive dam - building destroyed their way of life . [SEP]
[CLS] dams also cause less obvious , but potentially serious consequences , including increased eva ##por ##ation of water ( especially in arid regions ) , build ##up of si ##lt behind the dam , and changes to water temperature and flow patterns . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , it is now illegal to block the migration of fish , for example the white stu ##rgeon in north america , so fish ladder ##s must be provided by dam builders . [SEP]
