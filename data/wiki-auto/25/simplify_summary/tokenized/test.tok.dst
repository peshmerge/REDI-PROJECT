[CLS] autism is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication , and by restricted and repetitive behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] parents usually notice signs during the first three years of their child ' s life . [SEP]
[CLS] these signs often develop gradually , though some children with autism reach their developmental milestone ##s at a normal pace before worse ##ning . [SEP]
[CLS] autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors . [SEP]
[CLS] risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections , such as rub ##ella , toxin ##s including val ##pro ##ic acid , alcohol , cocaine , pest ##icides and air pollution , fetal growth restriction , and auto ##im ##mun ##e diseases . [SEP]
[CLS] controversies surround other proposed environmental causes ; for example , the vaccine hypothesis , which has been di ##sp ##rove ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] autism affects information processing in the brain by altering connections and organization of nerve cells and their syn ##ap ##ses . [SEP]
[CLS] how this occurs is not well understood . [SEP]
[CLS] in the ds ##m - 5 , autism and less severe forms of the condition , including as ##per ##ger syndrome and per ##vas ##ive developmental disorder not otherwise specified ( pd ##d - nos ) , have been combined into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder ( as ##d ) . [SEP]
[CLS] early behavioral interventions or speech therapy can help children with autism gain self - care , social , and communication skills . [SEP]
[CLS] although there is no known cure , there have been cases of children who recovered . [SEP]
[CLS] not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood , though some are successful . [SEP]
[CLS] an au ##tist ##ic culture has developed , with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder . [SEP]
[CLS] globally , autism is estimated to affect 24 . 8 million people as of 2015 . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 2000s , the number of people affected was estimated at 1 – 2 per 1 , 000 people worldwide . [SEP]
[CLS] in the developed countries , about 1 . 5 % of children are diagnosed with as ##d as of 2017 , from 0 . 7 % in 2000 in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] it occurs four - to - five times more often in males than females . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the 1960s , which may be partly due to changes in diagnostic practice . [SEP]
[CLS] the question of whether actual rates have increased is un ##res ##olved . [SEP]
[CLS] autism is a highly variable , ne ##uro ##dev ##elo ##pment ##al disorder whose symptoms first appears during infancy or childhood , and generally follows a steady course without re ##mission . [SEP]
[CLS] people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal , or even superior , in others . [SEP]
[CLS] over ##t symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months , become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood , although often in more muted form . [SEP]
[CLS] it is distinguished not by a single sy ##mpt ##om but by a characteristic triad of symptoms : impairment ##s in social interaction ; impairment ##s in communication ; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] other aspects , such as at ##yp ##ical eating , are also common but are not essential for diagnosis . [SEP]
[CLS] individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly , without a sharp line separating path ##ological ##ly severe from common traits . [SEP]
[CLS] social deficit ##s distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders ( as ##d ; see classification ) from other developmental disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] people with autism have social impairment ##s and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted . [SEP]
[CLS] noted au ##tist ##ic temple grand ##in described her inability to understand the social communication of ne ##uro ##typical ##s , or people with normal neural development , as leaving her feeling " like an anthropologist on mars " . [SEP]
[CLS] unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood . [SEP]
[CLS] au ##tist ##ic infants show less attention to social stimuli , smile and look at others less often , and respond less to their own name . [SEP]
[CLS] au ##tist ##ic todd ##lers differ more striking ##ly from social norms ; for example , they have less eye contact and turn - taking , and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves , such as pointing at things . [SEP]
[CLS] three - to five - year - old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding , approach others spontaneously , im ##itate and respond to emotions , communicate non ##ver ##ball ##y , and take turns with others . [SEP]
[CLS] however , they do form attachment ##s to their primary care ##gi ##vers . [SEP]
[CLS] most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than ne ##uro ##typical children , although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe as ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] older children and adults with as ##d perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person ' s own emotions . [SEP]
[CLS] children with high - functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non - au ##tist ##ic peers , despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone . [SEP]
[CLS] making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism . [SEP]
[CLS] for them , the quality of friendships , not the number of friends , predict ##s how lonely they feel . [SEP]
[CLS] functional friendships , such as those resulting in invitations to parties , may affect the quality of life more deeply . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many an ##ec ##dot ##al reports , but few systematic studies , of aggression and violence in individuals with as ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] the limited data suggest that , in children with intellectual disability , autism is associated with aggression , destruction of property , and melt ##down ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs . [SEP]
[CLS] differences in communication may be present from the first year of life , and may include delayed onset of ba ##bbling , unusual gestures , diminished responsive ##ness , and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the care ##gi ##ver . [SEP]
[CLS] in the second and third years , children with autism have less frequent and less diverse ba ##bbling , consonants , words , and word combinations ; their gestures are less often integrated with words . [SEP]
[CLS] children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences , and are more likely to simply repeat others ' words ( echo ##lal ##ia ) or reverse pronouns . [SEP]
[CLS] joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech , and deficit ##s in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with as ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed - at object , and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience . [SEP]
[CLS] children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language . [SEP]
[CLS] in a pair of studies , high - functioning children with autism aged 8 – 15 performed equally well as , and as adults better than , individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling . [SEP]
[CLS] both au ##tist ##ic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language , comprehension and inference . [SEP]
[CLS] as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills , these studies suggest that people speaking to au ##tist ##ic individuals are more likely to over ##est ##imate what their audience comprehend ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] au ##tist ##ic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior , which the repetitive behavior scale - revised ( rb ##s - r ) cat ##ego ##rize ##s as follows . [SEP]
[CLS] no single repetitive or self - in ##ju ##rio ##us behavior seems to be specific to autism , but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors . [SEP]
[CLS] au ##tist ##ic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis , but that can affect the individual or the family . [SEP]
[CLS] an estimated 0 . 5 % to 10 % of individuals with as ##d show unusual abilities , ranging from splinter skills such as the memo ##rization of tri ##via to the extra ##ord ##ina ##rily rare talents of pro ##di ##gio ##us au ##tist ##ic sava ##nts . [SEP]
[CLS] many individuals with as ##d show superior skills in perception and attention , relative to the general population . [SEP]
[CLS] sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 % of those with autism , and are considered core features by some , although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] differences are greater for under - res ##pon ##si ##vity ( for example , walking into things ) than for over - res ##pon ##si ##vity ( for example , distress from loud noises ) or for sensation seeking ( for example , rhythmic movements ) . [SEP]
[CLS] an estimated 60 – 80 % of au ##tist ##ic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone , poor motor planning , and toe walking ; deficit ##s in motor coordination are per ##vas ##ive across as ##d and are greater in autism proper . [SEP]
[CLS] unusual eating behavior occurs in about three - quarters of children with as ##d , to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator . [SEP]
[CLS] select ##ivity is the most common problem , although eating rituals and food refusal also occur . [SEP]
[CLS] parents of children with as ##d have higher levels of stress . [SEP]
[CLS] siblings of children with as ##d report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] however , they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome ; siblings of individuals with as ##d have greater risk of negative well - being and poorer sibling relationships as adults . [SEP]
[CLS] there is tentative evidence that autism occurs more frequently in people with gender d ##ys ##ph ##oria . [SEP]
[CLS] gas ##tro ##int ##estinal problems are one of the most commonly associated medical disorders in people with autism . [SEP]
[CLS] these are linked to greater social impairment , ir ##rita ##bility , behavior and sleep problems , language impairment ##s and mood changes . [SEP]
[CLS] it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic , cognitive , and neural levels for autism ' s characteristic triad of symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] however , there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co - occur . [SEP]
[CLS] autism has a strong genetic basis , although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether as ##d is explained more by rare mutations with major effects , or by rare multi ##gen ##e interactions of common genetic variants . [SEP]
[CLS] complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes , the environment , and ep ##igen ##etic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are her ##ita ##ble and influence gene expression . [SEP]
[CLS] many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genome ##s of affected individuals and their parents . [SEP]
[CLS] studies of twins suggest that her ##ita ##bility is 0 . 7 for autism and as high as 0 . 9 for as ##d , and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be au ##tist ##ic than the general population . [SEP]
[CLS] however , most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified . [SEP]
[CLS] typically , autism cannot be traced to a men ##del ##ian ( single - gene ) mutation or to a single chromosome abnormal ##ity , and none of the genetic syndrome ##s associated with as ##ds have been shown to selective ##ly cause as ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] numerous candidate genes have been located , with only small effects at ##tri ##bu ##table to any particular gene . [SEP]
[CLS] most lo ##ci individually explain less than 1 % of cases of autism . [SEP]
[CLS] the large number of au ##tist ##ic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation — such as del ##eti ##ons , du ##plication ##s or inversion ##s in genetic material during mei ##osis . [SEP]
[CLS] hence , a substantial fraction of autism cases may be trace ##able to genetic causes that are highly her ##ita ##ble but not inherited : that is , the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome . [SEP]
[CLS] autism may be under ##dia ##gno ##sed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition , but genetic phenomena such as imprint ##ing and x link ##age have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males , and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often , such as the imprint ##ed brain theory and the extreme male brain theory . [SEP]
[CLS] maternal nutrition and inflammation during pre ##con ##ception and pregnancy influences fetal ne ##uro ##dev ##elo ##pment . [SEP]
[CLS] intra ##uter ##ine growth restriction is associated with as ##d , in both term and pre ##ter ##m infants . [SEP]
[CLS] maternal inflammatory and auto ##im ##mun ##e diseases may damage fetal tissues , ag ##gra ##vating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system . [SEP]
[CLS] exposure to air pollution during pregnancy , especially heavy metals and part ##iculate ##s , may increase the risk of autism . [SEP]
[CLS] environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or ex ##ace ##rba ##te autism include certain foods , infectious diseases , solvent ##s , pc ##bs , ph ##thal ##ates and ph ##eno ##ls used in plastic products , pest ##icides , bro ##minated flame re ##tar ##dant ##s , alcohol , smoking , illicit drugs , vaccines , and pre ##nat ##al stress . [SEP]
[CLS] some , such as the mm ##r vaccine , have been completely di ##sp ##rove ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] parents may first become aware of au ##tist ##ic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine va ##cci ##nation . [SEP]
[CLS] this has led to un ##su ##pp ##orted theories blaming vaccine " over ##load " , a vaccine pre ##ser ##vati ##ve , or the mm ##r vaccine for causing autism . [SEP]
[CLS] the latter theory was supported by a litigation - funded study that has since been shown to have been " an elaborate fraud " . [SEP]
[CLS] although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biological ##ly imp ##laus ##ible , parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood im ##mun ##izations , outbreak ##s of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries , and the prevent ##able deaths of several children . [SEP]
[CLS] autism ' s symptoms result from mat ##uration - related changes in various systems of the brain . [SEP]
[CLS] how autism occurs is not well understood . [SEP]
[CLS] its mechanism can be divided into two areas : the path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logy of brain structures and processes associated with autism , and the ne ##uro ##psy ##cho ##logical link ##ages between brain structures and behaviors . [SEP]
[CLS] the behaviors appear to have multiple path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logies . [SEP]
[CLS] there is evidence that gut – brain axis abnormalities may be involved . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2015 review proposed that immune d ##ys ##re ##gul ##ation , gas ##tro ##int ##estinal inflammation , mal ##fu ##nction of the auto ##no ##mic nervous system , gut flora alterations , and food meta ##bol ##ites may cause brain ne ##uro ##in ##fl ##am ##mation and dysfunction . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2016 review concludes that enter ##ic nervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism . [SEP]
[CLS] neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the int ##est ##ine to spread to the brain . [SEP]
[CLS] several lines of evidence point to syn ##ap ##tic dysfunction as a cause of autism . [SEP]
[CLS] some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupt ##ing some syn ##ap ##tic pathways , such as those involved with cell ad ##hesion . [SEP]
[CLS] gene replacement studies in mice suggest that au ##tist ##ic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in syn ##ap ##ses and on activity - dependent changes . [SEP]
[CLS] all known ter ##ato ##gens ( agents that cause birth defects ) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception , and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later , there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development . [SEP]
[CLS] diagnosis is based on behavior , not cause or mechanism . [SEP]
[CLS] under the ds ##m - 5 , autism is characterized by persistent deficit ##s in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts , as well as restricted , repetitive patterns of behavior , interests , or activities . [SEP]
[CLS] these deficit ##s are present in early childhood , typically before age three , and lead to clinical ##ly significant functional impairment . [SEP]
[CLS] sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional rec ##ip ##rocity , stereo ##type ##d and repetitive use of language or id ##ios ##yn ##cratic language , and persistent pre ##oc ##cup ##ation with unusual objects . [SEP]
[CLS] the disturbance must not be better accounted for by re ##tt syndrome , intellectual disability or global developmental delay . [SEP]
[CLS] ic ##d - 10 uses essentially the same definition . [SEP]
[CLS] several diagnostic instruments are available . [SEP]
[CLS] two are commonly used in autism research : the autism diagnostic interview - revised ( adi - r ) is a semi ##st ##ructured parent interview , and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ( ad ##os ) uses observation and interaction with the child . [SEP]
[CLS] the childhood autism rating scale ( cars ) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children . [SEP]
[CLS] the diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders ( disco ) may also be used . [SEP]
[CLS] a pediatric ##ian commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child . [SEP]
[CLS] if warrant ##ed , diagnosis and evaluation ##s are conducted with help from as ##d specialists , observing and assessing cognitive , communication , family , and other factors using standardized tools , and taking into account any associated medical conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] a pediatric ne ##uro ##psy ##cho ##logist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills , both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions . [SEP]
[CLS] a differential diagnosis for as ##d at this stage might also consider intellectual disability , hearing impairment , and a specific language impairment such as landau – k ##le ##ff ##ner syndrome . [SEP]
[CLS] the presence of autism can make it harder to dia ##gno ##se coe ##xi ##sti ##ng psychiatric disorders such as depression . [SEP]
[CLS] clinical genetics evaluation ##s are often done once as ##d is diagnosed , particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause . [SEP]
[CLS] although genetic technology allows clinical genetic ##ists to link an estimated 40 % of cases to genetic causes , consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high - resolution chromosome and fragile x testing . [SEP]
[CLS] a gen ##otype - first model of diagnosis has been proposed , which would routinely assess the genome ' s copy number variations . [SEP]
[CLS] as new genetic tests are developed several ethical , legal , and social issues will emerge . [SEP]
[CLS] commercial availability of tests may pre ##cede adequate understanding of how to use test results , given the complexity of autism ' s genetics . [SEP]
[CLS] metabolic and ne ##uro ##ima ##ging tests are sometimes helpful , but are not routine . [SEP]
[CLS] as ##d can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months , although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life : for example , a one - year - old who meets diagnostic criteria for as ##d is less likely than a three - year - old to continue to do so a few years later . [SEP]
[CLS] in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment , though few cases are handled that quickly in practice . [SEP]
[CLS] although the symptoms of autism and as ##d begin early in childhood , they are sometimes missed ; years later , adults may seek dia ##gno ##ses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves , to help their employers make adjustments , or in some locations to claim disability living allowance ##s or other benefits . [SEP]
[CLS] girls are often diagnosed later than boys . [SEP]
[CLS] under ##dia ##gno ##sis and over ##dia ##gno ##sis are problems in marginal cases , and much of the recent increase in the number of reported as ##d cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices . [SEP]
[CLS] the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to dia ##gno ##se as ##d , resulting in some over ##dia ##gno ##sis of children with uncertain symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] conversely , the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis . [SEP]
[CLS] it is particularly hard to dia ##gno ##se autism among the visually impaired , partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision , and partly because au ##tist ##ic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndrome ##s or blind ##isms . [SEP]
[CLS] autism is one of the five per ##vas ##ive developmental disorders ( pd ##d ) , which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication , and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] these symptoms do not imply sickness , fra ##gil ##ity , or emotional disturbance . [SEP]
[CLS] of the five pd ##d forms , as ##per ##ger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes ; re ##tt syndrome and childhood di ##sin ##te ##gra ##tive disorder share several signs with autism , but may have unrelated causes ; pd ##d not otherwise specified ( pd ##d - nos ; also called " at ##yp ##ical autism " ) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike with autism , people with as ##per ##ger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development . [SEP]
[CLS] the terminology of autism can be be ##wil ##der ##ing , with autism , as ##per ##ger syndrome and pd ##d - nos often called the " autism spectrum disorders " ( as ##d ) or sometimes the " au ##tist ##ic disorders " , whereas autism itself is often called " au ##tist ##ic disorder " , " childhood autism " , or " infant ##ile autism " . [SEP]
[CLS] in this article , " autism " refers to the classic au ##tist ##ic disorder ; in clinical practice , though , " autism " , " as ##d " , and " pd ##d " are often used interchange ##ably . [SEP]
[CLS] as ##d , in turn , is a subset of the broader autism ph ##eno ##type , which describes individuals who may not have as ##d but do have au ##tist ##ic - like traits , such as avoiding eye contact . [SEP]
[CLS] the manifestation ##s of autism cover a wide spectrum , ranging from individuals with severe impairment ##s — who may be silent , developmental ##ly disabled , and locked into hand flap ##ping and rocking — to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches , narrowly focused interests , and verb ##ose , pe ##dant ##ic communication . [SEP]
[CLS] because the behavior spectrum is continuous , boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes the syndrome is divided into low - , medium - or high - functioning autism ( l ##fa , mfa , and h ##fa ) , based on iq threshold ##s , or on how much support the individual requires in daily life ; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial . [SEP]
[CLS] autism can also be divided into syn ##dro ##mal and non - syn ##dro ##mal autism ; the syn ##dro ##mal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms , such as tube ##rous sc ##ler ##osis . [SEP]
[CLS] although individuals with as ##per ##ger syndrome tend to perform better cognitive ##ly than those with autism , the extent of the overlap between as ##per ##ger syndrome , h ##fa , and non - syn ##dro ##mal autism is unclear . [SEP]
[CLS] some studies have reported dia ##gno ##ses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills , as opposed to a failure to make progress , typically from 15 to 30 months of age . [SEP]
[CLS] the validity of this distinction remains controversial ; it is possible that reg ##ress ##ive autism is a specific sub ##type , or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression . [SEP]
[CLS] research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biological ##ly meaningful subgroup ##s within the au ##tist ##ic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry , psychology , ne ##uro ##logy and pediatric ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] newer technologies such as fm ##ri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biological ##ly relevant ph ##eno ##type ##s ( ob ##ser ##vable traits ) that can be viewed on brain scans , to help further ne ##uro ##gen ##etic studies of autism ; one example is lowered activity in the fu ##si ##form face area of the brain , which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] about half of parents of children with as ##d notice their child ' s unusual behaviors by age 18 months , and about four - fifth ##s notice by age 24 months . [SEP]
[CLS] according to an article , failure to meet any of the following milestone ##s " is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluation ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] delay in refer ##ral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long - term outcome " . [SEP]
[CLS] the united states prevent ##ive services task force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns . [SEP]
[CLS] the japanese practice is to screen all children for as ##d at 18 and 24 months , using autism - specific formal screening tests . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , in the uk , children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not known which approach is more effective . [SEP]
[CLS] screening tools include the modified check ##list for autism in todd ##lers ( m - chat ) , the early screening of au ##tist ##ic traits question ##naire , and the first year inventory ; initial data on m - chat and its predecessor , the check ##list for autism in todd ##lers ( chat ) , on children aged 18 – 30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity ( many false - negative ##s ) but good specific ##ity ( few false - positive ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it may be more accurate to pre ##cede these tests with a broadband screen ##er that does not distinguish as ##d from other developmental disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] screening tools designed for one culture ' s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture . [SEP]
[CLS] although genetic screening for autism is generally still imp ##rac ##tical , it can be considered in some cases , such as children with neurological symptoms and d ##ys ##morphic features . [SEP]
[CLS] while infection with rub ##ella during pregnancy causes fewer than 1 % of cases of autism , va ##cci ##nation against rub ##ella can prevent many of those cases . [SEP]
[CLS] the main goals when treating children with autism are to less ##en associated deficit ##s and family distress , and to increase quality of life and functional independence . [SEP]
[CLS] in general , higher iq ##s are correlated with greater responsive ##ness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes . [SEP]
[CLS] no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child ' s needs . [SEP]
[CLS] families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] services should be carried out by behavior analysts , special education teachers , speech path ##ologists , and licensed psychologists . [SEP]
[CLS] studies of interventions have method ##ological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the development of evidence - based interventions has advanced in recent years . [SEP]
[CLS] although many psycho ##so ##cial interventions have some positive evidence , suggesting that some form of treatment is prefer ##able to no treatment , the method ##ological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor , their clinical results are mostly tentative , and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options . [SEP]
[CLS] intensive , sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self - care , communication , and job skills , and often improve functioning and decrease sy ##mpt ##om severity and mala ##da ##ptive behaviors ; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not sub ##stan ##tia ##ted . [SEP]
[CLS] while medications have not been found to help with core symptoms , they may be used for associated symptoms , such as ir ##rita ##bility , ina ##tten ##tion , or repetitive behavior patterns . [SEP]
[CLS] educational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis ( aba ) , developmental models , structured teaching , speech and language therapy , social skills therapy , and occupational therapy . [SEP]
[CLS] among these approaches , interventions either treat au ##tist ##ic features comprehensive ##ly , or focal ##ize treatment on a specific area of deficit . [SEP]
[CLS] the quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention ( e ##ib ##i ) — a treatment procedure incorporating over thirty hours per week of the structured type of aba that is carried out with very young children — is currently low , and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed . [SEP]
[CLS] two theoretical framework ##s outlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalist ##ic aba interventions , and developmental social pr ##ag ##matic models ( ds ##p ) . [SEP]
[CLS] one intervention ##al strategy utilizes a parent training model , which teaches parents how to implement various aba and ds ##p techniques , allowing for parents to di ##sse ##minate interventions themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] various ds ##p programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at - home parent implementation . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the recent development of parent training models , these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies , being evaluated as a probable e ##ffi ##ca ##cious mode of treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] early , intensive aba therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication , as well as adaptive and global functioning in preschool children ; it is well - established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , a teacher - implemented intervention that utilizes a more naturalist ##ic form of aba combined with a developmental social pr ##ag ##matic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social - communication skills in young children , although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] ne ##uro ##psy ##cho ##logical reports are often poorly communicated to educators , resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up , and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results . [SEP]
[CLS] the appropriate ##ness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers . [SEP]
[CLS] medications may be used to treat as ##d symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails . [SEP]
[CLS] they may also be used for associated health problems , such as ad ##hd or anxiety . [SEP]
[CLS] more than half of us children diagnosed with as ##d are prescribed psycho ##active drugs or anti ##con ##vu ##ls ##ants , with the most common drug classes being anti ##de ##press ##ants , st ##im ##ula ##nts , and anti ##psy ##cho ##tics . [SEP]
[CLS] the at ##yp ##ical anti ##psy ##cho ##tic drugs ri ##sper ##idon ##e and ari ##pi ##pr ##az ##ole are fda - approved for treating associated aggressive and self - in ##ju ##rio ##us behaviors . [SEP]
[CLS] however , their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits , and people with autism may respond at ##yp ##ically . [SEP]
[CLS] side effects , for example , may include weight gain , tired ##ness , dr ##ool ##ing , and aggression . [SEP]
[CLS] ssr ##i anti ##de ##press ##ants , such as flu ##ox ##eti ##ne and flu ##vo ##xa ##mine , have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritual ##istic behaviors , while the st ##im ##ula ##nt medication methyl ##ph ##eni ##date is beneficial for some children with co - mor ##bid ina ##tten ##tive ##ness or hyper ##act ##ivity . [SEP]
[CLS] there is scan ##t reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with as ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] no known medication relieve ##s autism ' s core symptoms of social and communication impairment ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or mod ##ulating gene function , suggesting the possibility of targeting the ##ra ##pies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism . [SEP]
[CLS] although many alternative the ##ra ##pies and interventions are available , few are supported by scientific studies . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality - of - life contexts , and many programs focus on success measures that lack predict ##ive validity and real - world relevance . [SEP]
[CLS] some alternative treatments may place the child at risk . [SEP]
[CLS] the preference that children with autism have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone co ##rti ##cal thickness with this being greater in those on case ##in - free diet ##s , as a consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin d ; however , sub ##op ##ti ##mal bone development in as ##d has also been associated with lack of exercise and gas ##tro ##int ##estinal disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2005 , bot ##ched che ##lation therapy killed a five - year - old child with autism . [SEP]
[CLS] che ##lation is not recommended for people with as ##d since the associated risks out ##weig ##h any potential benefits . [SEP]
[CLS] another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is cease therapy , a mixture of home ##opa ##thy , supplements , and ' vaccine det ##ox ##ing ' . [SEP]
[CLS] although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism , as of 2018 there is no good evidence to recommend a g ##lu ##ten - and case ##in - free diet as a standard treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2018 review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism , such as those with known food into ##ler ##ances or all ##er ##gies , or with food into ##ler ##ance markers . [SEP]
[CLS] the authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the g ##lu ##ten - and case ##in - free diet in children with as ##d ( 4 in total ) . [SEP]
[CLS] all of them compared g ##lu ##ten - and case ##in - free diet versus normal diet with a control group ( 2 double blind random ##ized controlled trials , 1 double blind crossover trial , 1 single blind trial ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in two of the studies , whose duration was 12 and 24 months , a significant improvement in as ##d symptoms ( efficacy rate 50 % ) was identified . [SEP]
[CLS] in the other two studies , whose duration was 3 months , no significant effect was observed . [SEP]
[CLS] the authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the as ##d symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] other problems documented in the trials carried out include trans ##gre ##ssion ##s of the diet , small sample size , the het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y of the participants and the possibility of a place ##bo effect . [SEP]
[CLS] in the subset of people who have g ##lu ##ten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a g ##lu ##ten - free diet may improve some au ##tist ##ic behaviors . [SEP]
[CLS] there is tentative evidence that music therapy may improve social interactions , verbal communication , and non - verbal communication skills . [SEP]
[CLS] there has been early research looking at hyper ##bari ##c treatments in children with autism . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no known cure . [SEP]
[CLS] children recover occasionally , so that they lose their diagnosis of as ##d ; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not known how often recovery happens ; reported rates in un ##sel ##ect ##ed samples have ranged from 3 % to 25 % . [SEP]
[CLS] most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger , though a few have developed communication skills in later years . [SEP]
[CLS] most children with autism lack social support , meaningful relationships , future employment opportunities or self - determination . [SEP]
[CLS] although core difficulties tend to persist , symptoms often become less severe with age . [SEP]
[CLS] few high - quality studies address long - term pro ##gno ##sis . [SEP]
[CLS] some adults show modest improvement in communication skills , but a few decline ; no study has focused on autism after mid ##life . [SEP]
[CLS] acquiring language before age six , having an iq above 50 , and having a market ##able skill all predict better outcomes ; independent living is unlikely with severe autism . [SEP]
[CLS] many individuals with autism face significant obstacles in transition ##ing to adulthood . [SEP]
[CLS] compared to the general population individuals with autism are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had a job . [SEP]
[CLS] about half of people in their 20s with autism are not employed . [SEP]
[CLS] most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1 – 2 per 1 , 000 for autism and close to 6 per 1 , 000 for as ##d , and 11 per 1 , 000 children in the united states for as ##d as of 2008 ; because of inadequate data , these numbers may under ##est ##imate as ##d ' s true rate . [SEP]
[CLS] globally , autism affects an estimated 24 . 8 million people as of 2015 , while as ##per ##ger syndrome affects a further 37 . 2 million . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2012 , the nhs estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the uk was 1 . 1 % . [SEP]
[CLS] rates of pd ##d - nos ' s has been estimated at 3 . 7 per 1 , 000 , as ##per ##ger syndrome at roughly 0 . 6 per 1 , 000 , and childhood di ##sin ##te ##gra ##tive disorder at 0 . 02 per 1 , 000 . [SEP]
[CLS] cdc estimates about 1 out of 59 ( 1 . 7 % ) for 2014 , an increase from 1 out of every 68 children ( 1 . 5 % ) for 2010 . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s . [SEP]
[CLS] this increase is largely at ##tri ##bu ##table to changes in diagnostic practices , refer ##ral patterns , availability of services , age at diagnosis , and public awareness , though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out . [SEP]
[CLS] the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism ' s true prevalence has increased ; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics . [SEP]
[CLS] boys are at higher risk for as ##d than girls . [SEP]
[CLS] the sex ratio averages 4 . 3 : 1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment : it may be close to 2 : 1 with intellectual disability and more than 5 . 5 : 1 without . [SEP]
[CLS] several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated , but the cause of the difference is un ##con ##firmed ; one theory is that females are under ##dia ##gno ##sed . [SEP]
[CLS] although the evidence does not imp ##lica ##te any single pregnancy - related risk factor as a cause of autism , the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent , and with diabetes , bleeding , and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers ; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm , and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism . [SEP]
[CLS] most professionals believe that race , ethnicity , and socio ##economic background do not affect the occurrence of autism . [SEP]
[CLS] several other conditions are common in children with autism . [SEP]
[CLS] a few examples of au ##tist ##ic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named . [SEP]
[CLS] the " table talk " of martin luther , compiled by his note ##take ##r , math ##es ##ius , contains the story of a 12 - year - old boy who may have been severely au ##tist ##ic . [SEP]
[CLS] luther reportedly thought the boy was a soul ##less mass of flesh possessed by the devil , and suggested that he be su ##ff ##oca ##ted , although a later critic has cast doubt on the vera ##city of this report . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest well - documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borg ##ue , as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to ann ##ul blair ' s marriage to gain blair ' s inheritance . [SEP]
[CLS] the wild boy of ave ##yr ##on , a feral child caught in 1798 , showed several signs of autism ; the medical student jean it ##ard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachment ##s and to induce speech via imitation . [SEP]
[CLS] the new latin word " autism ##us " ( english translation " autism " ) was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen b ##le ##ule ##r in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] he derived it from the greek word " auto ##s " ( α ##υ ##τ ##ος , meaning " self " ) , and used it to mean mor ##bid self - admiration , referring to " au ##tist ##ic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies , against which any influence from outside becomes an into ##ler ##able disturbance " . [SEP]
[CLS] a soviet child psychiatrist , gr ##un ##ya su ##khar ##eva , described a similar syndrome that was published in russian in 1925 , and in german in 1926 . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " autism " first took its modern sense in 1938 when hans as ##per ##ger of the vienna university hospital adopted b ##le ##ule ##r ' s terminology " au ##tist ##ic psycho ##path ##s " in a lecture in german about child psychology . [SEP]
[CLS] as ##per ##ger was investigating an as ##d now known as as ##per ##ger syndrome , though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981 . [SEP]
[CLS] leo kan ##ner of the johns hopkins hospital first used " autism " in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label " early infant ##ile autism " in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities . [SEP]
[CLS] almost all the characteristics described in kan ##ner ' s first paper on the subject , notably " au ##tist ##ic alone ##ness " and " insistence on same ##ness " , are still regarded as typical of the au ##tist ##ic spectrum of disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not known whether kan ##ner derived the term independently of as ##per ##ger . [SEP]
[CLS] donald triple ##tt was the first person diagnosed with autism . [SEP]
[CLS] he was diagnosed by kan ##ner after being first examined in 1938 , and was labeled as " case 1 " . [SEP]
[CLS] triple ##tt was noted for his sava ##nt abilities , particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multi ##ply numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] his father , oliver , described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns , music notes , letters of the alphabet , and u . s . president pictures . [SEP]
[CLS] by the age of 2 , he had the ability to rec ##ite the 23rd psalm and memo ##rized 25 questions and answers from the presbyterian cat ##ech ##ism . [SEP]
[CLS] he was also interested in creating musical chords . [SEP]
[CLS] kan ##ner ' s re ##use of " autism " led to decades of confused terminology like " infant ##ile schizophrenia " , and child psychiatry ' s focus on maternal deprivation led to mis ##con ##ception ##s of autism as an infant ' s response to " refrigerator mothers " . [SEP]
[CLS] starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome . [SEP]
[CLS] as late as the mid - 1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism ; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most her ##ita ##ble psychiatric conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] although the rise of parent organizations and the des ##ti ##gm ##ati ##zation of childhood as ##d have affected how as ##d is viewed , parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child ' s au ##tist ##ic behavior is perceived negatively , and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research . [SEP]
[CLS] it took until 1980 for the ds ##m - iii to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1987 , the ds ##m - iii - r provided a check ##list for dia ##gno ##sing autism . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 2013 , the ds ##m - 5 was released , up ##dating the classification for per ##vas ##ive developmental disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] the grouping of disorders , including pd ##d - nos , autism , as ##per ##ger syndrome , re ##tt syndrome , and cd ##d , has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] the two categories that exist are impaired social communication and / or interaction , and restricted and / or repetitive behaviors . [SEP]
[CLS] the internet has helped au ##tist ##ic individuals bypass non ##ver ##bal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with , and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely . [SEP]
[CLS] societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed : some in the community seek a cure , while others believe that autism is simply another way of being . [SEP]
[CLS] an au ##tist ##ic culture has emerged , accompanied by the au ##tist ##ic rights and ne ##uro ##di ##vers ##ity movements . [SEP]
[CLS] events include world autism awareness day , autism sunday , au ##tist ##ic pride day , au ##tre ##at , and others . [SEP]
[CLS] organizations dedicated to promoting awareness of autism include autism speaks , autism national committee , and autism society of america . [SEP]
[CLS] social - science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about " autism as a culture , trans ##cultural comparisons . . . and research on social movements . " [SEP]
[CLS] while most au ##tist ##ic individuals do not have sava ##nt skills , many have been successful in their fields . [SEP]
[CLS] the autism rights movement is a social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of ne ##uro ##di ##vers ##ity , viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured . [SEP]
[CLS] the autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of au ##tist ##ic behaviors ; the ##ra ##pies that focus on coping skills rather than im ##itating the behaviors those without autism ; and the recognition of the au ##tist ##ic community as a minority group . [SEP]
[CLS] autism rights or ne ##uro ##di ##vers ##ity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome . [SEP]
[CLS] this perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views : the medical perspective , that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene ( s ) , and fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines . [SEP]
[CLS] a common criticism against au ##tist ##ic activists is that the majority of them are " high - functioning " or have as ##per ##ger syndrome and do not represent the views of " low - functioning " au ##tist ##ic people . [SEP]
[CLS] about half of au ##tist ##ics are unemployed , and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed . [SEP]
[CLS] among au ##tist ##ics who find work , most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum . [SEP]
[CLS] while employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision , experienced employers of au ##tist ##ics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in au ##tist ##ic employees . [SEP]
[CLS] a majority of the economic burden of autism if caused by decreased earnings in the job market . [SEP]
[CLS] some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for au ##tist ##ic children . [SEP]
