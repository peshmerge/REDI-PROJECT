[CLS] autism is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication , and by restricted and repetitive behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] parents usually notice signs during the first three years of their child ' s life . [SEP]
[CLS] these signs often develop gradually , though some children with autism reach their developmental milestone ##s at a normal pace before worse ##ning . [SEP]
[CLS] in the ds ##m - 5 , autism and less severe forms of the condition , including as ##per ##ger syndrome and per ##vas ##ive developmental disorder not otherwise specified ( pd ##d - nos ) , have been combined into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder ( as ##d ) . [SEP]
[CLS] not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood , though some are successful . [SEP]
[CLS] an au ##tist ##ic culture has developed , with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the 1960s , which may be partly due to changes in diagnostic practice . [SEP]
[CLS] autism is a highly variable , ne ##uro ##dev ##elo ##pment ##al disorder whose symptoms first appears during infancy or childhood , and generally follows a steady course without re ##mission . [SEP]
[CLS] over ##t symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months , become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood , although often in more muted form . [SEP]
[CLS] other aspects , such as at ##yp ##ical eating , are also common but are not essential for diagnosis . [SEP]
[CLS] social deficit ##s distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders ( as ##d ; see classification ) from other developmental disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] people with autism have social impairment ##s and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted . [SEP]
[CLS] noted au ##tist ##ic temple grand ##in described her inability to understand the social communication of ne ##uro ##typical ##s , or people with normal neural development , as leaving her feeling " like an anthropologist on mars " . [SEP]
[CLS] au ##tist ##ic todd ##lers differ more striking ##ly from social norms ; for example , they have less eye contact and turn - taking , and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves , such as pointing at things . [SEP]
[CLS] three - to five - year - old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding , approach others spontaneously , im ##itate and respond to emotions , communicate non ##ver ##ball ##y , and take turns with others . [SEP]
[CLS] most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than ne ##uro ##typical children , although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe as ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] older children and adults with as ##d perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person ' s own emotions . [SEP]
[CLS] children with high - functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non - au ##tist ##ic peers , despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone . [SEP]
[CLS] functional friendships , such as those resulting in invitations to parties , may affect the quality of life more deeply . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many an ##ec ##dot ##al reports , but few systematic studies , of aggression and violence in individuals with as ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] the limited data suggest that , in children with intellectual disability , autism is associated with aggression , destruction of property , and melt ##down ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs . [SEP]
[CLS] differences in communication may be present from the first year of life , and may include delayed onset of ba ##bbling , unusual gestures , diminished responsive ##ness , and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the care ##gi ##ver . [SEP]
[CLS] in the second and third years , children with autism have less frequent and less diverse ba ##bbling , consonants , words , and word combinations ; their gestures are less often integrated with words . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed - at object , and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience . [SEP]
[CLS] both au ##tist ##ic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language , comprehension and inference . [SEP]
[CLS] as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills , these studies suggest that people speaking to au ##tist ##ic individuals are more likely to over ##est ##imate what their audience comprehend ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] no single repetitive or self - in ##ju ##rio ##us behavior seems to be specific to autism , but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors . [SEP]
[CLS] sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 % of those with autism , and are considered core features by some , although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] an estimated 60 – 80 % of au ##tist ##ic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone , poor motor planning , and toe walking ; deficit ##s in motor coordination are per ##vas ##ive across as ##d and are greater in autism proper . [SEP]
[CLS] unusual eating behavior occurs in about three - quarters of children with as ##d , to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator . [SEP]
[CLS] siblings of children with as ##d report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship . [SEP]
[CLS] however , they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome ; siblings of individuals with as ##d have greater risk of negative well - being and poorer sibling relationships as adults . [SEP]
[CLS] gas ##tro ##int ##estinal problems are one of the most commonly associated medical disorders in people with autism . [SEP]
[CLS] it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic , cognitive , and neural levels for autism ' s characteristic triad of symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] autism has a strong genetic basis , although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether as ##d is explained more by rare mutations with major effects , or by rare multi ##gen ##e interactions of common genetic variants . [SEP]
[CLS] typically , autism cannot be traced to a men ##del ##ian ( single - gene ) mutation or to a single chromosome abnormal ##ity , and none of the genetic syndrome ##s associated with as ##ds have been shown to selective ##ly cause as ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] numerous candidate genes have been located , with only small effects at ##tri ##bu ##table to any particular gene . [SEP]
[CLS] the large number of au ##tist ##ic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation — such as del ##eti ##ons , du ##plication ##s or inversion ##s in genetic material during mei ##osis . [SEP]
[CLS] hence , a substantial fraction of autism cases may be trace ##able to genetic causes that are highly her ##ita ##ble but not inherited : that is , the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome . [SEP]
[CLS] autism may be under ##dia ##gno ##sed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition , but genetic phenomena such as imprint ##ing and x link ##age have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males , and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often , such as the imprint ##ed brain theory and the extreme male brain theory . [SEP]
[CLS] exposure to air pollution during pregnancy , especially heavy metals and part ##iculate ##s , may increase the risk of autism . [SEP]
[CLS] environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or ex ##ace ##rba ##te autism include certain foods , infectious diseases , solvent ##s , pc ##bs , ph ##thal ##ates and ph ##eno ##ls used in plastic products , pest ##icides , bro ##minated flame re ##tar ##dant ##s , alcohol , smoking , illicit drugs , vaccines , and pre ##nat ##al stress . [SEP]
[CLS] parents may first become aware of au ##tist ##ic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine va ##cci ##nation . [SEP]
[CLS] the latter theory was supported by a litigation - funded study that has since been shown to have been " an elaborate fraud " . [SEP]
[CLS] although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biological ##ly imp ##laus ##ible , parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood im ##mun ##izations , outbreak ##s of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries , and the prevent ##able deaths of several children . [SEP]
[CLS] its mechanism can be divided into two areas : the path ##op ##hy ##sio ##logy of brain structures and processes associated with autism , and the ne ##uro ##psy ##cho ##logical link ##ages between brain structures and behaviors . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2016 review concludes that enter ##ic nervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism . [SEP]
[CLS] neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the int ##est ##ine to spread to the brain . [SEP]
[CLS] all known ter ##ato ##gens ( agents that cause birth defects ) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception , and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later , there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development . [SEP]
[CLS] under the ds ##m - 5 , autism is characterized by persistent deficit ##s in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts , as well as restricted , repetitive patterns of behavior , interests , or activities . [SEP]
[CLS] two are commonly used in autism research : the autism diagnostic interview - revised ( adi - r ) is a semi ##st ##ructured parent interview , and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ( ad ##os ) uses observation and interaction with the child . [SEP]
[CLS] the childhood autism rating scale ( cars ) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children . [SEP]
[CLS] a pediatric ne ##uro ##psy ##cho ##logist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills , both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions . [SEP]
[CLS] a differential diagnosis for as ##d at this stage might also consider intellectual disability , hearing impairment , and a specific language impairment such as landau – k ##le ##ff ##ner syndrome . [SEP]
[CLS] clinical genetics evaluation ##s are often done once as ##d is diagnosed , particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause . [SEP]
[CLS] a gen ##otype - first model of diagnosis has been proposed , which would routinely assess the genome ' s copy number variations . [SEP]
[CLS] commercial availability of tests may pre ##cede adequate understanding of how to use test results , given the complexity of autism ' s genetics . [SEP]
[CLS] as ##d can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months , although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life : for example , a one - year - old who meets diagnostic criteria for as ##d is less likely than a three - year - old to continue to do so a few years later . [SEP]
[CLS] in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment , though few cases are handled that quickly in practice . [SEP]
[CLS] although the symptoms of autism and as ##d begin early in childhood , they are sometimes missed ; years later , adults may seek dia ##gno ##ses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves , to help their employers make adjustments , or in some locations to claim disability living allowance ##s or other benefits . [SEP]
[CLS] under ##dia ##gno ##sis and over ##dia ##gno ##sis are problems in marginal cases , and much of the recent increase in the number of reported as ##d cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices . [SEP]
[CLS] the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to dia ##gno ##se as ##d , resulting in some over ##dia ##gno ##sis of children with uncertain symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] it is particularly hard to dia ##gno ##se autism among the visually impaired , partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision , and partly because au ##tist ##ic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndrome ##s or blind ##isms . [SEP]
[CLS] autism is one of the five per ##vas ##ive developmental disorders ( pd ##d ) , which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication , and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] these symptoms do not imply sickness , fra ##gil ##ity , or emotional disturbance . [SEP]
[CLS] of the five pd ##d forms , as ##per ##ger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes ; re ##tt syndrome and childhood di ##sin ##te ##gra ##tive disorder share several signs with autism , but may have unrelated causes ; pd ##d not otherwise specified ( pd ##d - nos ; also called " at ##yp ##ical autism " ) is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder . [SEP]
[CLS] the terminology of autism can be be ##wil ##der ##ing , with autism , as ##per ##ger syndrome and pd ##d - nos often called the " autism spectrum disorders " ( as ##d ) or sometimes the " au ##tist ##ic disorders " , whereas autism itself is often called " au ##tist ##ic disorder " , " childhood autism " , or " infant ##ile autism " . [SEP]
[CLS] the manifestation ##s of autism cover a wide spectrum , ranging from individuals with severe impairment ##s — who may be silent , developmental ##ly disabled , and locked into hand flap ##ping and rocking — to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches , narrowly focused interests , and verb ##ose , pe ##dant ##ic communication . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes the syndrome is divided into low - , medium - or high - functioning autism ( l ##fa , mfa , and h ##fa ) , based on iq threshold ##s , or on how much support the individual requires in daily life ; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial . [SEP]
[CLS] autism can also be divided into syn ##dro ##mal and non - syn ##dro ##mal autism ; the syn ##dro ##mal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms , such as tube ##rous sc ##ler ##osis . [SEP]
[CLS] although individuals with as ##per ##ger syndrome tend to perform better cognitive ##ly than those with autism , the extent of the overlap between as ##per ##ger syndrome , h ##fa , and non - syn ##dro ##mal autism is unclear . [SEP]
[CLS] the validity of this distinction remains controversial ; it is possible that reg ##ress ##ive autism is a specific sub ##type , or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression . [SEP]
[CLS] research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biological ##ly meaningful subgroup ##s within the au ##tist ##ic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry , psychology , ne ##uro ##logy and pediatric ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] newer technologies such as fm ##ri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biological ##ly relevant ph ##eno ##type ##s ( ob ##ser ##vable traits ) that can be viewed on brain scans , to help further ne ##uro ##gen ##etic studies of autism ; one example is lowered activity in the fu ##si ##form face area of the brain , which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] according to an article , failure to meet any of the following milestone ##s " is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluation ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] delay in refer ##ral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long - term outcome " . [SEP]
[CLS] the united states prevent ##ive services task force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns . [SEP]
[CLS] the japanese practice is to screen all children for as ##d at 18 and 24 months , using autism - specific formal screening tests . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast , in the uk , children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened . [SEP]
[CLS] screening tools include the modified check ##list for autism in todd ##lers ( m - chat ) , the early screening of au ##tist ##ic traits question ##naire , and the first year inventory ; initial data on m - chat and its predecessor , the check ##list for autism in todd ##lers ( chat ) , on children aged 18 – 30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity ( many false - negative ##s ) but good specific ##ity ( few false - positive ##s ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it may be more accurate to pre ##cede these tests with a broadband screen ##er that does not distinguish as ##d from other developmental disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] screening tools designed for one culture ' s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture . [SEP]
[CLS] although genetic screening for autism is generally still imp ##rac ##tical , it can be considered in some cases , such as children with neurological symptoms and d ##ys ##morphic features . [SEP]
[CLS] while infection with rub ##ella during pregnancy causes fewer than 1 % of cases of autism , va ##cci ##nation against rub ##ella can prevent many of those cases . [SEP]
[CLS] the main goals when treating children with autism are to less ##en associated deficit ##s and family distress , and to increase quality of life and functional independence . [SEP]
[CLS] no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child ' s needs . [SEP]
[CLS] although many psycho ##so ##cial interventions have some positive evidence , suggesting that some form of treatment is prefer ##able to no treatment , the method ##ological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor , their clinical results are mostly tentative , and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options . [SEP]
[CLS] intensive , sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self - care , communication , and job skills , and often improve functioning and decrease sy ##mpt ##om severity and mala ##da ##ptive behaviors ; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not sub ##stan ##tia ##ted . [SEP]
[CLS] while medications have not been found to help with core symptoms , they may be used for associated symptoms , such as ir ##rita ##bility , ina ##tten ##tion , or repetitive behavior patterns . [SEP]
[CLS] the quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention ( e ##ib ##i ) — a treatment procedure incorporating over thirty hours per week of the structured type of aba that is carried out with very young children — is currently low , and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed . [SEP]
[CLS] one intervention ##al strategy utilizes a parent training model , which teaches parents how to implement various aba and ds ##p techniques , allowing for parents to di ##sse ##minate interventions themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] early , intensive aba therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication , as well as adaptive and global functioning in preschool children ; it is well - established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , a teacher - implemented intervention that utilizes a more naturalist ##ic form of aba combined with a developmental social pr ##ag ##matic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social - communication skills in young children , although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] ne ##uro ##psy ##cho ##logical reports are often poorly communicated to educators , resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up , and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results . [SEP]
[CLS] the appropriate ##ness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers . [SEP]
[CLS] medications may be used to treat as ##d symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails . [SEP]
[CLS] more than half of us children diagnosed with as ##d are prescribed psycho ##active drugs or anti ##con ##vu ##ls ##ants , with the most common drug classes being anti ##de ##press ##ants , st ##im ##ula ##nts , and anti ##psy ##cho ##tics . [SEP]
[CLS] ssr ##i anti ##de ##press ##ants , such as flu ##ox ##eti ##ne and flu ##vo ##xa ##mine , have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritual ##istic behaviors , while the st ##im ##ula ##nt medication methyl ##ph ##eni ##date is beneficial for some children with co - mor ##bid ina ##tten ##tive ##ness or hyper ##act ##ivity . [SEP]
[CLS] there is scan ##t reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with as ##d . [SEP]
[CLS] experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or mod ##ulating gene function , suggesting the possibility of targeting the ##ra ##pies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism . [SEP]
[CLS] although many alternative the ##ra ##pies and interventions are available , few are supported by scientific studies . [SEP]
[CLS] the preference that children with autism have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone co ##rti ##cal thickness with this being greater in those on case ##in - free diet ##s , as a consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin d ; however , sub ##op ##ti ##mal bone development in as ##d has also been associated with lack of exercise and gas ##tro ##int ##estinal disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] che ##lation is not recommended for people with as ##d since the associated risks out ##weig ##h any potential benefits . [SEP]
[CLS] although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism , as of 2018 there is no good evidence to recommend a g ##lu ##ten - and case ##in - free diet as a standard treatment . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2018 review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism , such as those with known food into ##ler ##ances or all ##er ##gies , or with food into ##ler ##ance markers . [SEP]
[CLS] the authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the g ##lu ##ten - and case ##in - free diet in children with as ##d ( 4 in total ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the as ##d symptoms . [SEP]
[CLS] other problems documented in the trials carried out include trans ##gre ##ssion ##s of the diet , small sample size , the het ##ero ##gen ##eit ##y of the participants and the possibility of a place ##bo effect . [SEP]
[CLS] children recover occasionally , so that they lose their diagnosis of as ##d ; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not . [SEP]
[CLS] it is not known how often recovery happens ; reported rates in un ##sel ##ect ##ed samples have ranged from 3 % to 25 % . [SEP]
[CLS] most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger , though a few have developed communication skills in later years . [SEP]
[CLS] acquiring language before age six , having an iq above 50 , and having a market ##able skill all predict better outcomes ; independent living is unlikely with severe autism . [SEP]
[CLS] compared to the general population individuals with autism are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had a job . [SEP]
[CLS] this increase is largely at ##tri ##bu ##table to changes in diagnostic practices , refer ##ral patterns , availability of services , age at diagnosis , and public awareness , though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out . [SEP]
[CLS] the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism ' s true prevalence has increased ; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics . [SEP]
[CLS] although the evidence does not imp ##lica ##te any single pregnancy - related risk factor as a cause of autism , the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent , and with diabetes , bleeding , and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy . [SEP]
[CLS] the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers ; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm , and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism . [SEP]
[CLS] the " table talk " of martin luther , compiled by his note ##take ##r , math ##es ##ius , contains the story of a 12 - year - old boy who may have been severely au ##tist ##ic . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest well - documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borg ##ue , as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to ann ##ul blair ' s marriage to gain blair ' s inheritance . [SEP]
[CLS] the wild boy of ave ##yr ##on , a feral child caught in 1798 , showed several signs of autism ; the medical student jean it ##ard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachment ##s and to induce speech via imitation . [SEP]
[CLS] he derived it from the greek word " auto ##s " ( α ##υ ##τ ##ος , meaning " self " ) , and used it to mean mor ##bid self - admiration , referring to " au ##tist ##ic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies , against which any influence from outside becomes an into ##ler ##able disturbance " . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " autism " first took its modern sense in 1938 when hans as ##per ##ger of the vienna university hospital adopted b ##le ##ule ##r ' s terminology " au ##tist ##ic psycho ##path ##s " in a lecture in german about child psychology . [SEP]
[CLS] leo kan ##ner of the johns hopkins hospital first used " autism " in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label " early infant ##ile autism " in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities . [SEP]
[CLS] almost all the characteristics described in kan ##ner ' s first paper on the subject , notably " au ##tist ##ic alone ##ness " and " insistence on same ##ness " , are still regarded as typical of the au ##tist ##ic spectrum of disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] his father , oliver , described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns , music notes , letters of the alphabet , and u . s . president pictures . [SEP]
[CLS] he was also interested in creating musical chords . [SEP]
[CLS] kan ##ner ' s re ##use of " autism " led to decades of confused terminology like " infant ##ile schizophrenia " , and child psychiatry ' s focus on maternal deprivation led to mis ##con ##ception ##s of autism as an infant ' s response to " refrigerator mothers " . [SEP]
[CLS] although the rise of parent organizations and the des ##ti ##gm ##ati ##zation of childhood as ##d have affected how as ##d is viewed , parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child ' s au ##tist ##ic behavior is perceived negatively , and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 2013 , the ds ##m - 5 was released , up ##dating the classification for per ##vas ##ive developmental disorders . [SEP]
[CLS] the internet has helped au ##tist ##ic individuals bypass non ##ver ##bal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with , and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely . [SEP]
[CLS] societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed : some in the community seek a cure , while others believe that autism is simply another way of being . [SEP]
[CLS] the autism rights movement is a social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of ne ##uro ##di ##vers ##ity , viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured . [SEP]
[CLS] the autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of au ##tist ##ic behaviors ; the ##ra ##pies that focus on coping skills rather than im ##itating the behaviors those without autism ; and the recognition of the au ##tist ##ic community as a minority group . [SEP]
[CLS] autism rights or ne ##uro ##di ##vers ##ity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome . [SEP]
[CLS] this perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views : the medical perspective , that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene ( s ) , and fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines . [SEP]
[CLS] a common criticism against au ##tist ##ic activists is that the majority of them are " high - functioning " or have as ##per ##ger syndrome and do not represent the views of " low - functioning " au ##tist ##ic people . [SEP]
[CLS] about half of au ##tist ##ics are unemployed , and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed . [SEP]
[CLS] while employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision , experienced employers of au ##tist ##ics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in au ##tist ##ic employees . [SEP]
[CLS] some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for au ##tist ##ic children . [SEP]
