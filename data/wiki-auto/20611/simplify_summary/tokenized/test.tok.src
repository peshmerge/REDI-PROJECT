[CLS] in clad ##istic ##s , a mono ##phy ##let ##ic group , or clade , is a group of organisms that consists of all the descendants of a common ancestor ( or more precisely ancestral population ) . [SEP]
[CLS] mono ##phy ##let ##ic groups are typically characterised by shared derived characteristics ( syn ##ap ##omo ##rp ##hi ##es ) , which distinguish organisms in the clade from other organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] the arrangement of the members of a mono ##phy ##let ##ic group is called a mono ##phy ##ly . [SEP]
[CLS] mono ##phy ##ly is contrasted with para ##phy ##ly and poly ##phy ##ly as shown in the second diagram . [SEP]
[CLS] a " para ##phy ##let ##ic group " consists of all of the descendants of a common ancestor minus one or more mono ##phy ##let ##ic groups . [SEP]
[CLS] a " poly ##phy ##let ##ic group " is characterized by converge ##nt features or habits of scientific interest ( for example , night - active primate ##s , fruit trees , aquatic insects ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the features by which a poly ##phy ##let ##ic group is differentiated from others are not inherited from a common ancestor . [SEP]
[CLS] these definitions have taken some time to be accepted . [SEP]
[CLS] when the clad ##istic ##s school of thought became mainstream in the 1960s , several alternative definitions were in use . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , taxon ##omi ##sts sometimes used terms without defining them , leading to confusion in the early literature , a confusion which persist ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the first diagram shows a phylogenetic tree with two mono ##phy ##let ##ic groups . [SEP]
[CLS] the several groups and subgroup ##s are particularly situated as branches of the tree to indicate ordered line ##al relationships between all the organisms shown . [SEP]
[CLS] further , any group may ( or may not ) be considered a taxon by modern systematic ##s , depending upon the selection of its members in relation to their common ancestor ( s ) ; see second and third diagrams . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " mono ##phy ##ly " , or " mono ##phy ##let ##ic " , derives from the two ancient greek words , meaning " alone , only , unique " , and , meaning " genus , species " , and refers to the fact that a mono ##phy ##let ##ic group includes organisms ( e . g . , genera , species ) consisting of all the descendants of a " unique " common ancestor . [SEP]
[CLS] conversely , the term " poly ##phy ##ly " , or " poly ##phy ##let ##ic " , builds on the ancient greek prefix , meaning " many , a lot of " , and refers to the fact that a poly ##phy ##let ##ic group includes organisms arising from " multiple " ancestral sources . [SEP]
[CLS] by comparison , the term " para ##phy ##ly " , or " para ##phy ##let ##ic " , uses the ancient greek prefix , meaning " beside , near " , and refers to the situation in which one or several mono ##phy ##let ##ic subgroup ##s are " left apart " from all other descendants of a unique common ancestor . [SEP]
[CLS] that is , a para ##phy ##let ##ic group is " nearly " mono ##phy ##let ##ic , hence the prefix " " . [SEP]
[CLS] on the broad ##est scale , definitions fall into two groups . [SEP]
