a monophyletic group is a group of organisms that have all the descendants of a common ancestor .
monophyletic groups are typically characterised by shared characteristics â€” synapomorphiesculus , which distinguish organisms in the clade from other organisms .
the arrangement of the members of a monophyletic group is called a monophyletic .
monophyly is contrasted with polyphyly and polyphyly .
a group of the same ancestor is the descendants of one or more monophyletic groups .
a " polyphyletic group " has convergent features or habits of scientific interest .
the features by which a polyphyletic group is differentiated from others are not inherited from a common ancestor .
these definitions have taken some time to be accepted .
when the cladistics school of thought became mainstream in the 1960s , several alternative definitions were in use .
this confusion in the early literature is a confusion which persists .
the first diagram shows a phylogenetic tree with two monophyletic groups .
the several groups and subgroups are particularly situated as branches of the tree to show the relationships between all the organisms shown .
any group may curve or may not seem a taxon by modern systematics , depending on the selection of its members in relation to their common ancestor ancestor ancestor ancestor ancestor ; see second and third diagrams .
the term " monophyly " , or " monophyletic " , comes from the two ancient greek words , meaning " alone " , " unique " , and " " .
polyphyletic means " many , a lot of " .
the term " paraphyly " , or " paraphyletic " , uses the ancient greek prefix , meaning " beside , near " .
a paraphyletic group is a group of atoms with a " nearly " monophyletic , hence the prefix " .
definitions of the broadest scale fall into two groups .
