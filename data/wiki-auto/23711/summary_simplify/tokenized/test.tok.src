[CLS] pun ##ct ##uation ( formerly sometimes called pointing ) is the use of spa ##cing , conventional signs and certain ty ##po ##graphic ##al devices as aids to the understanding and correct reading of written text whether read silently or aloud . [SEP]
[CLS] another description is , " it is the practice action or system of insert ##ing points or other small marks into texts in order to aid interpretation ; division of text into sentences , clauses , etc . , by means of such marks . " [SEP]
[CLS] for example : " woman , without her man , is nothing " ( emphasizing the importance of men to women ) , and " woman : without her , man is nothing " ( emphasizing the importance of women to men ) have very different meanings ; as do " eats shoots and leaves " ( which means the subject consume ##s plant growth ##s ) and " eats , shoots , and leaves " ( which means the subject eats first , then fires a weapon , and then leaves the scene ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the sharp differences in meaning are produced by the simple differences in pun ##ct ##uation within the example pairs , especially the latter . [SEP]
[CLS] the rules of pun ##ct ##uation vary with language , location , register and time and are constantly evolving . [SEP]
[CLS] certain aspects of pun ##ct ##uation are stylistic and are thus the author ' s ( or editor ' s ) choice , or ta ##chy ##graphic ( short ##hand ) language forms , such as those used in online chat and text messages . [SEP]
[CLS] the first writing systems were either logo ##graphic or sy ##lla ##bic ##for example , chinese and maya ##n script ##w ##hic ##h do not necessarily require pun ##ct ##uation , especially spa ##cing . [SEP]
[CLS] this is because the entire mor ##ph ##eme or word is typically clustered within a single g ##ly ##ph , so spa ##cing does not help as much to distinguish where one word ends and the other starts . [SEP]
[CLS] di ##sam ##bi ##gua ##tion and emphasis can easily be communicated without pun ##ct ##uation by employing a separate written form distinct from the spoken form of the language that uses slightly different phrase ##ology . [SEP]
[CLS] even today , written english differs subtly from spoken english because not all emphasis and di ##sam ##bi ##gua ##tion is possible to convey in print , even with pun ##ct ##uation . [SEP]
[CLS] however , many warring states period bamboo texts contain the symbols and indicating the end of a chapter and full stop , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest alphabet ##ic writing had no capital ##ization , no spaces , no vowels and few pun ##ct ##uation marks . [SEP]
[CLS] this worked as long as the subject matter was restricted to a limited range of topics ( for example , writing used for recording business transactions ) . [SEP]
[CLS] most texts were still written in " script ##ura con ##tin ##ua " , that is without any separation between words . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the greeks were sporadic ##ally using pun ##ct ##uation marks consisting of vertically arranged dots — usually two ( di ##col ##on ) or three ( tri ##col ##on ) — in around the 5th century bc as an aid in the oral delivery of texts . [SEP]
[CLS] greek playwright ##s such as eu ##rip ##ides and ari ##sto ##pha ##nes used symbols to distinguish the ends of phrases in written drama : this essentially helped the play ' s cast to know when to pause . [SEP]
[CLS] after 200 bc , the greeks used ari ##sto ##pha ##nes of by ##zan ##tium ' s system ( called ) of a single dot placed at varying heights to mark up speeches at rhetoric ##al divisions : in addition , the greeks used the paragraph ##os ( or gamma ) to mark the beginning of sentences , marginal dip ##les to mark quota ##tions , and a ko ##ron ##is to indicate the end of major sections . [SEP]
[CLS] the romans ( 1st century bc ) also occasionally used symbols to indicate pauses , but the greek — under the name " distinction ##es " — prevailed by the ad 4th century as reported by ae ##lius dona ##tus and is ##ido ##re of seville ( 7th century ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these were designed to be read aloud , so the copy ##ists began to introduce a range of marks to aid the reader , including ind ##entation , various pun ##ct ##uation marks ( dip ##le , , ) , and an early version of initial capitals . [SEP]
[CLS] jerome and his colleagues , who made a translation of the bible into latin , the " vu ##lga ##te " ( ad 400 ) , employed a layout system based on established practices for teaching the speeches of demos ##the ##nes and cicero . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 7th – 8th centuries irish and anglo - saxon scribe ##s , whose native languages were not derived from latin , added more visual cues to render texts more intel ##li ##gible . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , ins ##ular scribe ##s adopted the system while adapting it for minus ##cule script ( so as to be more prominent ) by using not differing height but rather a differing number of marks — aligned horizontally ( or sometimes triangular ##ly ) — to sign ##ify a pause ' s value : one mark for a minor pause , two for a medium one , and three for a major . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late 8th century a different system emerged in france under the carol ##ing ##ian dynasty . [SEP]
[CLS] originally indicating how the voice should be mod ##ulated when chanting the liturgy , the migrated into any text meant to be read aloud , and then to all manuscripts . [SEP]
[CLS] first reached england in the late 10th century probably during the benedictine reform movement , but was not adopted until after the norman conquest . [SEP]
[CLS] direct quota ##tions were marked with marginal dip ##les , as in antiquity , but from at least the 12th century scribe ##s also began entering dip ##les ( sometimes double ) within the column of text . [SEP]
[CLS] the amount of printed material and its readers ##hip began to increase after the invention of move ##able type in europe in the 145 ##0s . [SEP]
[CLS] as explained by writer and editor lynne truss , " the rise of printing in the 14th and 15th centuries meant that a standard system of pun ##ct ##uation was urgently required . " [SEP]
[CLS] the introduction of a standard system of pun ##ct ##uation has also been attributed to the venetian printers al ##dus man ##uti ##us and his grandson . [SEP]
[CLS] they have been credited with popular ##izing the practice of ending sentences with the colon or full stop , in ##venting the semi ##col ##on , making occasional use of parentheses and creating the modern com ##ma by lowering the vi ##rg ##ule . [SEP]
[CLS] by the 19th century , pun ##ct ##uation in the western world had evolved " to classify the marks hierarchical ##ly , in terms of weight " . [SEP]
[CLS] the introduction of electrical telegraph ##y with a limited set of transmission codes and type ##writer ##s with a limited set of keys influenced pun ##ct ##uation subtly . [SEP]
[CLS] the h ##yp ##hen , minus sign , and dash ##es of various width ##s were collapsed into a single character ( - , sometimes repeated as - - to represent a long dash ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in some cases a type ##writer keyboard did not include an ex ##cl ##ama ##tion point ( ! ) [SEP]
[CLS] but this was constructed by the overs ##tri ##ke of an ap ##ost ##rop ##he and a period ; the original morse code did not represent an ex ##cl ##ama ##tion point at all . [SEP]
[CLS] treatment of whites ##pace in html discouraged the practice ( in english prose ) of putting two full spaces after a full stop , since a single or double space would appear the same on the screen . [SEP]
[CLS] the full traditional set of types ##etti ##ng tools became available with the advent of desktop publishing and more sophisticated word processors . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the widespread adoption of character sets like unicode that support traditionally types ##et pun ##ct ##uation , writing forms like text messages tend to use the simplified as ##ci ##i style of pun ##ct ##uation , with the addition of new non - text characters like em ##oj ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] informal text speak tends to drop pun ##ct ##uation when not needed , including some ways that would be considered errors in more formal writing . [SEP]
[CLS] due to its use in email and twitter handles , the at sign went from an obscure character mostly used by gr ##oc ##ers ( and not professional types ##ette ##rs ) to a very common character in common use for both technical routing and an abbreviation for " at " . [SEP]
[CLS] there are two major styles of pun ##ct ##uation in english : british or american . [SEP]
[CLS] these two styles differ mainly in the way in which they handle quota ##tion marks , particularly in conjunction with other pun ##ct ##uation marks . [SEP]
[CLS] in british english , pun ##ct ##uation such as periods and com ##mas are placed outside the closing quota ##tion mark ; in american english , however , pun ##ct ##uation is placed inside the closing quota ##tion mark . [SEP]
[CLS] this rule varies for other pun ##ct ##uation marks ; for example , american english follows the british english rule when it comes to semi ##col ##ons , colon ##s , question marks , and ex ##cl ##ama ##tion points . [SEP]
[CLS] the similarity is so strong that the few variations may confuse a native english reader . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , in french and russian , quotes would appear as : ( in french , each " double pun ##ct ##uation " , as the gui ##lle ##met , requires a non - breaking space ; in russian it does not ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in greek , the question mark is written as the english semi ##col ##on , while the functions of the colon and semi ##col ##on are performed by a raised point , known as the . [SEP]
[CLS] spanish uses an inverted question mark at the beginning of a question and the normal question mark at the end , as well as an inverted ex ##cl ##ama ##tion mark at the beginning of an ex ##cl ##ama ##tion and the normal ex ##cl ##ama ##tion mark at the end . [SEP]
[CLS] the full stop is represented by a colon , and vice versa ; the ex ##cl ##ama ##tion mark is represented by a diagonal similar to a til ##de , while the question mark resembles an un ##cl ##osed circle placed after the last vowel of the word . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 17th century , sanskrit and marathi , both written using dev ##ana ##gar ##i , started using the vertical bar to end a line of prose and double vertical bars in verse . [SEP]
[CLS] pun ##ct ##uation was not used in chinese , japanese , and korean writing until the adoption of pun ##ct ##uation from the west in the late 19th and early 20th century . [SEP]
[CLS] most pun ##ct ##uation marks in modern chinese , japanese , and korean have similar functions to their english counterparts ; however , they often look different and have different customary rules . [SEP]
[CLS] in the indian subcontinent , is sometimes used in place of colon or after a sub ##head ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] thai , khmer , lao and burmese did not use pun ##ct ##uation until the adoption of pun ##ct ##uation from the west in the 20th century . [SEP]
[CLS] blank spaces are more frequent than full stops or com ##mas . [SEP]
[CLS] these were intended for use as question and ex ##cl ##ama ##tion marks within a sentence , a function for which normal question and ex ##cl ##ama ##tion marks can also be used , but which may be considered ob ##sol ##es ##cent . [SEP]
[CLS] various sets of characters are referred to as " pun ##ct ##uation " in certain computing situations , many of which are also used to pun ##ct ##uate natural languages . [SEP]
