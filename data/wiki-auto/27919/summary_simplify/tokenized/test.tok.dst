[CLS] socio ##biology investigates social behaviors such as mating patterns , territorial fights , pack hunting , and the hive society of social insects . [SEP]
[CLS] it argues that just as selection pressure led to animals evolving useful ways of interacting with the natural environment , so also it led to the genetic evolution of advantage ##ous social behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] critics , led by richard lew ##ont ##in and stephen jay gould , argued that genes played a role in human behavior , but that traits such as aggressive ##ness could be explained by social environment rather than by biology . [SEP]
[CLS] socio ##biology is based on the premise that some behaviors ( social and individual ) are at least partly inherited and can be affected by natural selection . [SEP]
[CLS] it predict ##s that animals will act in ways that have proven to be evolution ##ari ##ly successful over time . [SEP]
[CLS] this can , among other things , result in the formation of complex social processes con ##du ##ci ##ve to evolutionary fitness . [SEP]
[CLS] the discipline seeks to explain behavior as a product of natural selection . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , newly dominant male lions often kill cubs in the pride that they did not sire . [SEP]
[CLS] this behavior is adaptive because killing the cubs eliminate ##s competition for their own offspring and causes the nursing females to come into heat faster , thus allowing more of his genes to enter into the population . [SEP]
[CLS] socio ##bio ##logists would view this instinct ##ual cub - killing behavior as being inherited through the genes of successfully rep ##rod ##uc ##ing male lions , whereas non - killing behavior may have died out as those lions were less successful in rep ##rod ##uc ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] the philosopher of biology daniel den ##nett suggested that the political philosopher thomas ho ##bbe ##s was the first socio ##bio ##logist , arguing that in his 1651 book " levi ##athan " ho ##bbe ##s had explained the origins of morals in human society from an amor ##al socio ##bio ##logical perspective . [SEP]
[CLS] the genetic ##ist of animal behavior john paul scott coined the word " socio ##biology " at a 1948 conference on genetics and social behaviour which called for a con ##jo ##int development of field and laboratory studies in animal behavior research . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1956 , e . o . wilson came in contact this emerging socio ##biology through his phd student stuart a . alt ##mann , who had been in close relation with the participants to the 1948 conference . [SEP]
[CLS] alt ##mann developed his own brand of socio ##biology to study the social behavior of r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues , using statistics , and was hired as a " socio ##bio ##logist " at the yer ##kes regional primate research center in 1965 . [SEP]
[CLS] wilson ' s socio ##biology is different from john paul scott ' s or alt ##mann ' s , ins ##of ##ar as he drew on mathematical models of social behavior centered on the maxim ##isation of the genetic fitness by w . d . hamilton , robert tri ##vers , john maynard smith , and george r . price . [SEP]
[CLS] the three socio ##bio ##logies by scott , alt ##mann and wilson have in common to place naturalist studies at the core of the research on animal social behavior and by drawing alliances with emerging research method ##ologies , at a time when " biology in the field " was threatened to be made old - fashioned by " modern " practices of science ( laboratory studies , mathematical biology , molecular biology ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the book pioneered and popularized the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviors such as alt ##ru ##ism , aggression , and nur ##tura ##nce , primarily in ants ( wilson ' s own research specialty ) and other h ##yme ##no ##pt ##era , but also in other animals . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the influence of evolution on behavior has been of interest to biologist ##s and philosophers since soon after the discovery of evolution itself . [SEP]
[CLS] the final chapter of the book is devoted to socio ##bio ##logical explanations of human behavior , and wilson later wrote a pulitzer prize winning book , " on human nature " , that addressed human behavior specifically . [SEP]
[CLS] edward h . hagen writes in " the handbook of evolutionary psychology " that socio ##biology is , despite the public controversy regarding the applications to humans , " one of the scientific triumph ##s of the twentieth century . " [SEP]
[CLS] the more general term behavioral ecology is commonly substituted for the term socio ##biology in order to avoid the public controversy . [SEP]
[CLS] socio ##bio ##logists maintain that human behavior , as well as non ##hum ##an animal behavior , can be partly explained as the outcome of natural selection . [SEP]
[CLS] they contend that in order to fully understand behavior , it must be analyzed in terms of evolutionary considerations . [SEP]
[CLS] variants of hereditary traits which increase an organism ' s ability to survive and reproduce will be more greatly represented in subsequent generations , i . e . , they will be " selected for " . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , inherited behavioral mechanisms that allowed an organism a greater chance of surviving and / or rep ##rod ##uc ##ing in the past are more likely to survive in present organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] that inherited adaptive behaviors are present in non ##hum ##an animal species has been multi ##ply demonstrated by biologist ##s , and it has become a foundation of evolutionary biology . [SEP]
[CLS] however , there is continued resistance by some researchers over the application of evolutionary models to humans , particularly from within the social sciences , where culture has long been assumed to be the predominant driver of behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , mothers within many species of mammals – including humans – are very protective of their offspring . [SEP]
[CLS] the social behavior is believed to have evolved in a fashion similar to other types of non ##be ##ha ##vio ##ral adaptations , such as a coat of fur , or the sense of smell . [SEP]
[CLS] if alt ##ru ##ism is genetically determined , then alt ##ru ##istic individuals must reproduce their own alt ##ru ##istic genetic traits for alt ##ru ##ism to survive , but when alt ##ru ##ists lavish their resources on non - alt ##ru ##ists at the expense of their own kind , the alt ##ru ##ists tend to die out and the others tend to increase . [SEP]
[CLS] this example raises the question of how alt ##ru ##istic genes can be passed on if this soldier dies without having any children . [SEP]
[CLS] within socio ##biology , a social behavior is first explained as a socio ##bio ##logical hypothesis by finding an evolution ##ari ##ly stable strategy that matches the observed behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] alt ##ru ##ism between social insects and litter ##mates has been explained in such a way . [SEP]
[CLS] alt ##ru ##istic behavior , behavior that increases the reproductive fitness of others at the apparent expense of the alt ##ru ##ist , in some animals has been correlated to the degree of genome shared between alt ##ru ##istic individuals . [SEP]
[CLS] a quantitative description of infant ##icide by male hare ##m - mating animals when the alpha male is displaced as well as rode ##nt female infant ##icide and fetal res ##or ##ption are active areas of study . [SEP]
[CLS] in general , females with more bearing opportunities may value offspring less , and may also arrange bearing opportunities to maximize the food and protection from mates . [SEP]
[CLS] the researchers who carry out those studies are careful to point out that her ##ita ##bility does not con ##stra ##in the influence that environmental or cultural factors may have on those traits . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the transcription factor fe ##v ( aka pet ##1 ) , through its role in maintaining the ser ##oton ##er ##gic system in the brain , is required for normal aggressive and anxiety - like behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , when fe ##v is genetically deleted from the mouse genome , male mice will instantly attack other males , whereas their wild - type counterparts take significantly longer to initiate violent behaviour . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , fe ##v has been shown to be required for correct maternal behaviour in mice , such that offspring of mothers without the fe ##v factor do not survive unless cross - foster ##ed to other wild - type female mice . [SEP]
[CLS] a genetic basis for instinct ##ive behaviour ##al traits among non - human species , such as in the above example , is commonly accepted among many biologist ##s ; however , attempting to use a genetic basis to explain complex behaviour ##s in human societies has remained extremely controversial . [SEP]
[CLS] steven pink ##er argues that critics have been overly swayed by politics and a fear of biological deter ##mini ##sm , accusing among others stephen jay gould and richard lew ##ont ##in of being " radical scientists " , whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science , while lew ##ont ##in , steven rose and leon kam ##in , who drew a distinction between the politics and history of an idea and its scientific validity , argue that socio ##biology fails on scientific grounds . [SEP]
[CLS] during a 1976 meeting of the socio ##biology study group , as reported by ul ##lica se ##gers ##tral ##e , cho ##ms ##ky argued for the importance of a socio ##bio ##logical ##ly informed notion of human nature . [SEP]
[CLS] cho ##ms ##ky argued that human beings are biological organisms and ought to be studied as such , with his criticism of the " blank slate " doctrine in the social sciences ( which would inspire a great deal of steven pink ##er ' s and others ' work in evolutionary psychology ) , in his 1975 " reflections on language " . [SEP]
[CLS] cho ##ms ##ky further hinted at the possible reconciliation of his anarchist political views and socio ##biology in a discussion of peter k ##rop ##ot ##kin ' s " " , which focused more on alt ##ru ##ism than aggression , suggesting that anarchist societies were feasible because of an innate human tendency to cooperate .
