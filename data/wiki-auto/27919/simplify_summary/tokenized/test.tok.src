[CLS] socio ##biology is a field of biology that aims to examine and explain social behavior in terms of evolution . [SEP]
[CLS] it draws from disciplines including et ##hol ##ogy , anthropology , evolution , zoology , archaeology , and population genetics . [SEP]
[CLS] within the study of human societies , socio ##biology is closely allied to darwin ##ian anthropology , human behavioral ecology and evolutionary psychology . [SEP]
[CLS] socio ##biology investigates social behaviors such as mating patterns , territorial fights , pack hunting , and the hive society of social insects . [SEP]
[CLS] it argues that just as selection pressure led to animals evolving useful ways of interacting with the natural environment , so also it led to the genetic evolution of advantage ##ous social behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] while the term " socio ##biology " originated at least as early as the 1940s , the concept did not gain major recognition until the publication of e . o . wilson ' s book " " in 1975 . [SEP]
[CLS] the new field quickly became the subject of controversy . [SEP]
[CLS] critics , led by richard lew ##ont ##in and stephen jay gould , argued that genes played a role in human behavior , but that traits such as aggressive ##ness could be explained by social environment rather than by biology . [SEP]
[CLS] socio ##bio ##logists responded by pointing to the complex relationship between nature and nur ##ture . [SEP]
[CLS] e . o . wilson defined socio ##biology as " the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization " . [SEP]
[CLS] socio ##biology is based on the premise that some behaviors ( social and individual ) are at least partly inherited and can be affected by natural selection . [SEP]
[CLS] it begins with the idea that behaviors have evolved over time , similar to the way that physical traits are thought to have evolved . [SEP]
[CLS] it predict ##s that animals will act in ways that have proven to be evolution ##ari ##ly successful over time . [SEP]
[CLS] this can , among other things , result in the formation of complex social processes con ##du ##ci ##ve to evolutionary fitness . [SEP]
[CLS] the discipline seeks to explain behavior as a product of natural selection . [SEP]
[CLS] behavior is therefore seen as an effort to preserve one ' s genes in the population . [SEP]
[CLS] inherent in socio ##bio ##logical reasoning is the idea that certain genes or gene combinations that influence particular behavioral traits can be inherited from generation to generation . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , newly dominant male lions often kill cubs in the pride that they did not sire . [SEP]
[CLS] this behavior is adaptive because killing the cubs eliminate ##s competition for their own offspring and causes the nursing females to come into heat faster , thus allowing more of his genes to enter into the population . [SEP]
[CLS] socio ##bio ##logists would view this instinct ##ual cub - killing behavior as being inherited through the genes of successfully rep ##rod ##uc ##ing male lions , whereas non - killing behavior may have died out as those lions were less successful in rep ##rod ##uc ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] the philosopher of biology daniel den ##nett suggested that the political philosopher thomas ho ##bbe ##s was the first socio ##bio ##logist , arguing that in his 1651 book " levi ##athan " ho ##bbe ##s had explained the origins of morals in human society from an amor ##al socio ##bio ##logical perspective . [SEP]
[CLS] the genetic ##ist of animal behavior john paul scott coined the word " socio ##biology " at a 1948 conference on genetics and social behaviour which called for a con ##jo ##int development of field and laboratory studies in animal behavior research . [SEP]
[CLS] with john paul scott ' s organizational efforts , a " section of animal behavior and socio ##biology " of the esa ( acronym stands for ? ) [SEP]
[CLS] was created in 1956 , which became a division of animal behavior of the american society of zoology in 1958 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1956 , e . o . wilson came in contact this emerging socio ##biology through his phd student stuart a . alt ##mann , who had been in close relation with the participants to the 1948 conference . [SEP]
[CLS] alt ##mann developed his own brand of socio ##biology to study the social behavior of r ##hes ##us mac ##aq ##ues , using statistics , and was hired as a " socio ##bio ##logist " at the yer ##kes regional primate research center in 1965 . [SEP]
[CLS] wilson ' s socio ##biology is different from john paul scott ' s or alt ##mann ' s , ins ##of ##ar as he drew on mathematical models of social behavior centered on the maxim ##isation of the genetic fitness by w . d . hamilton , robert tri ##vers , john maynard smith , and george r . price . [SEP]
[CLS] the three socio ##bio ##logies by scott , alt ##mann and wilson have in common to place naturalist studies at the core of the research on animal social behavior and by drawing alliances with emerging research method ##ologies , at a time when " biology in the field " was threatened to be made old - fashioned by " modern " practices of science ( laboratory studies , mathematical biology , molecular biology ) . [SEP]
[CLS] once a specialist term , " socio ##biology " became widely known in 1975 when wilson published his book " socio ##biology : the new synthesis " , which sparked an intense controversy . [SEP]
[CLS] since then " socio ##biology " has largely been e ##qua ##ted with wilson ' s vision . [SEP]
[CLS] the book pioneered and popularized the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviors such as alt ##ru ##ism , aggression , and nur ##tura ##nce , primarily in ants ( wilson ' s own research specialty ) and other h ##yme ##no ##pt ##era , but also in other animals . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the influence of evolution on behavior has been of interest to biologist ##s and philosophers since soon after the discovery of evolution itself . [SEP]
[CLS] peter k ##rop ##ot ##kin ' s " " , written in the early 1890s , is a popular example . [SEP]
[CLS] the final chapter of the book is devoted to socio ##bio ##logical explanations of human behavior , and wilson later wrote a pulitzer prize winning book , " on human nature " , that addressed human behavior specifically . [SEP]
[CLS] edward h . hagen writes in " the handbook of evolutionary psychology " that socio ##biology is , despite the public controversy regarding the applications to humans , " one of the scientific triumph ##s of the twentieth century . " [SEP]
[CLS] " socio ##biology is now part of the core research and curriculum of virtually all biology departments , and it is a foundation of the work of almost all field biologist ##s " socio ##bio ##logical research on non ##hum ##an organisms has increased dramatically and continuously in the world ' s top scientific journals such as " nature " and " science " . [SEP]
[CLS] the more general term behavioral ecology is commonly substituted for the term socio ##biology in order to avoid the public controversy . [SEP]
[CLS] socio ##bio ##logists maintain that human behavior , as well as non ##hum ##an animal behavior , can be partly explained as the outcome of natural selection . [SEP]
[CLS] they contend that in order to fully understand behavior , it must be analyzed in terms of evolutionary considerations . [SEP]
[CLS] natural selection is fundamental to evolutionary theory . [SEP]
[CLS] variants of hereditary traits which increase an organism ' s ability to survive and reproduce will be more greatly represented in subsequent generations , i . e . , they will be " selected for " . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , inherited behavioral mechanisms that allowed an organism a greater chance of surviving and / or rep ##rod ##uc ##ing in the past are more likely to survive in present organisms . [SEP]
[CLS] that inherited adaptive behaviors are present in non ##hum ##an animal species has been multi ##ply demonstrated by biologist ##s , and it has become a foundation of evolutionary biology . [SEP]
[CLS] however , there is continued resistance by some researchers over the application of evolutionary models to humans , particularly from within the social sciences , where culture has long been assumed to be the predominant driver of behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] socio ##biology uses nikola ##as tin ##berg ##en ' s four categories of questions and explanations of animal behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] two categories are at the species level ; two , at the individual level . [SEP]
[CLS] the species - level categories ( often called " ultimate explanations " ) are the individual - level categories ( often called " pro ##xi ##mate explanations " ) are [SEP]
[CLS] socio ##bio ##logists are interested in how behavior can be explained logical ##ly as a result of selective pressures in the history of a species . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , they are often interested in instinct ##ive , or intuitive behavior , and in explaining the similarities , rather than the differences , between cultures . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , mothers within many species of mammals – including humans – are very protective of their offspring . [SEP]
[CLS] socio ##bio ##logists reason that this protective behavior likely evolved over time because it helped the offspring of the individuals which had the characteristic to survive . [SEP]
[CLS] this parental protection would increase in frequency in the population . [SEP]
[CLS] the social behavior is believed to have evolved in a fashion similar to other types of non ##be ##ha ##vio ##ral adaptations , such as a coat of fur , or the sense of smell . [SEP]
[CLS] individual genetic advantage fails to explain certain social behaviors as a result of gene - centred selection . [SEP]
[CLS] e . o . wilson argued that evolution may also act upon groups . [SEP]
[CLS] the mechanisms responsible for group selection employ paradigm ##s and population statistics borrowed from evolutionary game theory . [SEP]
[CLS] alt ##ru ##ism is defined as " a concern for the welfare of others " . [SEP]
[CLS] if alt ##ru ##ism is genetically determined , then alt ##ru ##istic individuals must reproduce their own alt ##ru ##istic genetic traits for alt ##ru ##ism to survive , but when alt ##ru ##ists lavish their resources on non - alt ##ru ##ists at the expense of their own kind , the alt ##ru ##ists tend to die out and the others tend to increase . [SEP]
[CLS] an extreme example is a soldier losing his life trying to help a fellow soldier . [SEP]
[CLS] this example raises the question of how alt ##ru ##istic genes can be passed on if this soldier dies without having any children . [SEP]
[CLS] within socio ##biology , a social behavior is first explained as a socio ##bio ##logical hypothesis by finding an evolution ##ari ##ly stable strategy that matches the observed behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] stability of a strategy can be difficult to prove , but usually , it will predict gene frequencies . [SEP]
[CLS] the hypothesis can be supported by establishing a correlation between the gene frequencies predicted by the strategy , and those expressed in a population . [SEP]
[CLS] alt ##ru ##ism between social insects and litter ##mates has been explained in such a way . [SEP]
[CLS] alt ##ru ##istic behavior , behavior that increases the reproductive fitness of others at the apparent expense of the alt ##ru ##ist , in some animals has been correlated to the degree of genome shared between alt ##ru ##istic individuals . [SEP]
[CLS] a quantitative description of infant ##icide by male hare ##m - mating animals when the alpha male is displaced as well as rode ##nt female infant ##icide and fetal res ##or ##ption are active areas of study . [SEP]
[CLS] in general , females with more bearing opportunities may value offspring less , and may also arrange bearing opportunities to maximize the food and protection from mates . [SEP]
[CLS] an important concept in socio ##biology is that temperament traits exist in an ecological balance . [SEP]
[CLS] just as an expansion of a sheep population might encourage the expansion of a wolf population , an expansion of alt ##ru ##istic traits within a gene pool may also encourage increasing numbers of individuals with dependent traits . [SEP]
[CLS] studies of human behavior genetics have generally found behavioral traits such as creativity , ex ##tro ##version , aggressive ##ness , and iq have high her ##ita ##bility . [SEP]
[CLS] the researchers who carry out those studies are careful to point out that her ##ita ##bility does not con ##stra ##in the influence that environmental or cultural factors may have on those traits . [SEP]
[CLS] criminal ##ity is actively under study , but extremely controversial . [SEP]
[CLS] there are arguments that in some environments criminal behavior might be adaptive . [SEP]
[CLS] the novelist elias cane ##tti also has noted applications of socio ##bio ##logical theory to cultural practices such as slavery and auto ##cr ##acy . [SEP]
[CLS] genetic mouse mutants illustrate the power that genes ex ##ert on behaviour . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the transcription factor fe ##v ( aka pet ##1 ) , through its role in maintaining the ser ##oton ##er ##gic system in the brain , is required for normal aggressive and anxiety - like behavior . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , when fe ##v is genetically deleted from the mouse genome , male mice will instantly attack other males , whereas their wild - type counterparts take significantly longer to initiate violent behaviour . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , fe ##v has been shown to be required for correct maternal behaviour in mice , such that offspring of mothers without the fe ##v factor do not survive unless cross - foster ##ed to other wild - type female mice . [SEP]
[CLS] a genetic basis for instinct ##ive behaviour ##al traits among non - human species , such as in the above example , is commonly accepted among many biologist ##s ; however , attempting to use a genetic basis to explain complex behaviour ##s in human societies has remained extremely controversial . [SEP]
[CLS] steven pink ##er argues that critics have been overly swayed by politics and a fear of biological deter ##mini ##sm , accusing among others stephen jay gould and richard lew ##ont ##in of being " radical scientists " , whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science , while lew ##ont ##in , steven rose and leon kam ##in , who drew a distinction between the politics and history of an idea and its scientific validity , argue that socio ##biology fails on scientific grounds . [SEP]
[CLS] gould grouped socio ##biology with eugen ##ics , criticizing both in his book " the mis ##me ##as ##ure of man " . [SEP]
[CLS] no ##am cho ##ms ##ky has expressed views on socio ##biology on several occasions . [SEP]
[CLS] during a 1976 meeting of the socio ##biology study group , as reported by ul ##lica se ##gers ##tral ##e , cho ##ms ##ky argued for the importance of a socio ##bio ##logical ##ly informed notion of human nature . [SEP]
[CLS] cho ##ms ##ky argued that human beings are biological organisms and ought to be studied as such , with his criticism of the " blank slate " doctrine in the social sciences ( which would inspire a great deal of steven pink ##er ' s and others ' work in evolutionary psychology ) , in his 1975 " reflections on language " . [SEP]
[CLS] cho ##ms ##ky further hinted at the possible reconciliation of his anarchist political views and socio ##biology in a discussion of peter k ##rop ##ot ##kin ' s " " , which focused more on alt ##ru ##ism than aggression , suggesting that anarchist societies were feasible because of an innate human tendency to cooperate . [SEP]
[CLS] wilson has claimed that he had never meant to imply what " ought " to be , only what " is " the case . [SEP]
[CLS] however , some critics have argued that the language of socio ##biology readily slips from " is " to " ought " , an instance of the naturalist ##ic fall ##acy . [SEP]
[CLS] pink ##er has argued that opposition to stance ##s considered anti - social , such as ethnic ne ##pot ##ism , is based on moral assumptions , meaning that such opposition is not fa ##ls ##if ##iable by scientific advances . [SEP]
[CLS] the history of this debate , and others related to it , are covered in detail by , , and . [SEP]
