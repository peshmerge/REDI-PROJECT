the picometreonic international spelling is a unit of length in the metric system .
the picometre is one thousandthractive -lrb- nanometre -rrb- of a micrometre micrometrehend , one millionth of a micrometrezard , and used to be called micromicron , stigma , or bicron .
the picometre 's length is of an order so small that its application is mostly used in particle physics , quantum physics , chemistry and acoustics .
some of the particles are the components of atoms themselves Â¥ , such as hadrons and the upper limits of possible size for fermion point particles .
the laser interferometer space antenna percival probe is planned for launch in 2034 to directly detect gravitational waves .
