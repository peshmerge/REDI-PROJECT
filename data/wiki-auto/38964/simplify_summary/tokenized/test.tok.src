[CLS] the pic ##ome ##tre ( international spelling as used by the international bureau of weights and measures ; si symbol : pm ) or pic ##ometer ( american spelling ) is a unit of length in the metric system , equal to , or one trillion ##th of a metre , which is the si base unit of length . [SEP]
[CLS] the pic ##ome ##tre is one thousand ##th ( × nm ) of a nano ##met ##re , one million ##th of a micro ##met ##re ( also known as a micro ##n ) , and used to be called micro ##mic ##ron , stigma , or bi ##cr ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] the symbol μ ##μ was once used for it . [SEP]
[CLS] it is also one hundred ##th of an ang ##strom , an internationally recognised ( but non - si ) unit of length . [SEP]
[CLS] the pic ##ome ##tre ' s length is of an order so small that its application is almost entirely confined to particle physics , quantum physics , chemistry and acoustic ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] atoms are between 62 and 520 pm in diameter , and the typical length of a carbon - carbon single bond is 154 pm . [SEP]
[CLS] smaller units still may be used to describe smaller particles ( some of which are the components of atoms themselves ) , such as had ##rons and the upper limits of possible size for fe ##rmi ##on point particles . [SEP]
[CLS] the laser inter ##fer ##ometer space antenna ( lisa ) probe is planned for launch in 203 ##4 to directly detect gravitational waves and will measure relative displacement ##s with a resolution of 20 pic ##ome ##tres over a distance of 2 . 5 gig ##ame ##tres , yielding a strain sensitivity of better than 1 part in 10 .
