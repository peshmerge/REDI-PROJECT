[CLS] she was born at the old cat ##aw ##ba hospital in newton , north carolina during a trip from their georgetown home in washington , d . c . amos has said that her maternal grandparents each had an eastern cherokee grandpa ##rent of their own . [SEP]
[CLS] of particular importance to her as a child was her maternal grandfather , calvin clinton copeland , who was a great source of inspiration and guidance , offering a more pan ##the ##istic spiritual alternative to her father and paternal grandmother ' s traditional christianity . [SEP]
[CLS] when she was two years old , her family moved to baltimore , maryland , where her father had transplant ##ed his methodist ministry from its original base in washington , d . c . [SEP]
[CLS] her older brother and sister took piano lessons , but tori didn ' t need them . [SEP]
[CLS] from the time she could reach the piano , she taught herself to play : when she was two , she could reproduce pieces of music she had only heard once , and , by the age of three , she was composing her own songs . [SEP]
[CLS] at five , she became the youngest student ever admitted to the preparatory division of the peabody conservatory of music . [SEP]
[CLS] she studied classical piano at peabody from 1968 to 1974 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1974 , when she was eleven , her scholarship was discontinued , and she was asked to leave . [SEP]
[CLS] amos has asserted that she lost the scholarship because of her interest in rock and popular music , coupled with her dislike for reading from sheet music . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1972 , the amos family moved to silver spring , maryland , where her father became pastor of the good shepherd united methodist church . [SEP]
[CLS] at thirteen , amos began playing at gay bars and piano bars , cha ##per ##oned by her father . [SEP]
[CLS] amos won a county teen talent contest in 1977 , singing a song called " more than just a friend " . [SEP]
[CLS] as a senior at richard montgomery high school , she co - wrote " baltimore " with her brother mike amos for a competition involving the baltimore orioles . [SEP]

[CLS] before this , she had performed under her middle name , ellen , but permanently adopted tori after a friend ' s boyfriend told her she looked like a torre ##y pine , a tree native to the west coast . [SEP]
[CLS] by the time she was 17 , amos had a stock of homemade demo tapes that her father regularly sent out to record companies and producers . [SEP]
[CLS] producer nara ##da michael walden responded favorably : he and amos cut some tracks together , but none were released . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , atlantic records responded to one of the tapes , and , when a & r man jason fl ##om flew to baltimore to audition her in person , the label was convinced and signed her . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1984 , amos moved to los angeles to pursue her music career after several years performing on the piano bar circuit in the d . c . area . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1986 , amos formed a musical group called y kant tori read , named for her difficulty sight reading . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to amos , the group was composed of steve cat ##on ( who would later play guitars on all of her albums until 1999 ) , drummer matt so ##rum , bass player brad cobb and , for a short time , keyboardist jim tau ##ber . [SEP]
[CLS] the band went through several iteration ##s of songwriting and recording ; amos has said interference from record executives caused the band to lose its musical edge and direction during this time . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , in july 1988 , the band ' s self - titled debut album , " y kant tori read " , was released . [SEP]
[CLS] although its producer , joe chi ##cca ##relli , stated that amos was very happy with the album at the time , amos has since criticized it , once remark ##ing : " the only good thing about that album is my ankle high boots . " [SEP]
[CLS] following the album ' s commercial failure and the group ' s subsequent di ##sb ##and ##ing , amos began working with other artists ( including stan rid ##g ##way , sandra bernhard , and al stewart ) as a backup vocalist . [SEP]
[CLS] she also recorded a song called " distant storm " for the film " china o ' brien . " [SEP]
[CLS] in the credits , the song is attributed to a band called tess makes good . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the disappointing reaction to " y kant tori read " , amos still had to comply with her six - record contract with atlantic records , which , in 1989 , wanted a new record by march 1990 . [SEP]
[CLS] the initial recordings were declined by the label , which amos felt was because the album had not been properly presented . [SEP]
[CLS] the album was reworked and expanded under the guidance of doug morris and the musical talents of steve cat ##on , eric ross ##e , will mac ##gre ##gor , carlo nu ##cci ##o , and dan ne ##ben ##zal , resulting in " little earthquakes " , an album rec ##ount ##ing her religious upbringing , sexual awakening , struggle to establish her identity , and sexual assault . [SEP]
[CLS] this album became her commercial and artistic breakthrough , entering the british charts in january 1992 at number 15 . [SEP]
[CLS] " little earthquakes " was released in the united states in february 1992 and slowly but steadily began to attract listeners , gaining more attention with the video for the single " silent all these years " . [SEP]
[CLS] amos traveled to new mexico with personal and professional partner eric ross ##e in 1993 to write and largely record her second solo record , " under the pink " . [SEP]
[CLS] the album was received with mostly favorable reviews and sold enough copies to chart at no . 12 on the " billboard 200 " , a significantly higher position than the preceding album ' s position at no . 54 on the same chart . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the album found its biggest success in the uk , debuting at number one upon release in february 1994 . [SEP]
[CLS] her third solo album , " boys for pe ##le " , was released in january 1996 . [SEP]
[CLS] the album was recorded in an irish church , in del ##gan ##y , county wi ##ck ##low , with amos taking advantage of the church ' s acoustic ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] for this album , amos used the harpsichord , harmon ##ium , and cl ##avi ##cho ##rd as well as the piano . [SEP]
[CLS] the album garnered mixed reviews upon its release , with some critics praising its intensity and unique ##ness while others be ##mo ##ane ##d its comparative imp ##ene ##tra ##bility . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the album ' s erratic lyrical content and instrumentation , the latter of which kept it away from mainstream audiences , " boys for pe ##le " is amos ' s most successful simultaneous transatlantic release , reaching no . 2 on the uk top 40 and no . 2 on the billboard 200 upon its release . [SEP]
[CLS] fueled by the desire to have her own recording studio to distance herself from record company executives , amos had the barn of her home in cornwall converted into the state - of - the - art recording studio of martian engineering studios . [SEP]
[CLS] " from the choir ##girl hotel " and " to venus and back " , released in may 1998 and september 1999 , respectively , differ greatly from previous albums . [SEP]
[CLS] amos ' s trademark acoustic , piano - based sound is largely replaced with arrangements that include elements of electronic ##a and dance music with vocal wash ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] the underlying themes of both albums deal with woman ##hood and amos ' s own mis ##carriage ##s and marriage . [SEP]
[CLS] reviews for " from the choir ##girl hotel " were mostly favorable and praised amos ' s continued artistic original ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] debut sales for " from the choir ##girl hotel " are amos ' s best to date , selling 153 , 000 copies in its first week . [SEP]

[CLS] shortly after giving birth to her daughter , amos decided to record a cover album , taking songs written by men about women and rev ##ers ##ing the gender roles to reflect a woman ' s perspective . [SEP]
[CLS] that became " strange little girls " , released in september 2001 . [SEP]
[CLS] the album is amos ' s first concept album , with artwork featuring amos photographed in character of the women portrayed in each song . [SEP]
[CLS] amos would later reveal that a stimulus for the album was to end her contract with atlantic without giving them original songs ; amos felt that since 1998 , the label had not been properly promoting her and had trapped her in a contract by refusing to sell her to another label . [SEP]
[CLS] with her atlantic contract fulfilled after a 15 - year stint , amos signed to epic in late 2001 . [SEP]
[CLS] in october 2002 , amos released " scarlet ' s walk " , another concept album . [SEP]

[CLS] while the newly merged label was present throughout the production process of " the bee ##keeper " , amos and her crew nearly completed her next project , " american doll posse " , before inviting the label to listen to it . [SEP]
[CLS] " american doll posse " , another concept album , is fashioned around a group of girls ( the " posse " ) who are used as a theme of alter - ego ##s of amos ' s . [SEP]
