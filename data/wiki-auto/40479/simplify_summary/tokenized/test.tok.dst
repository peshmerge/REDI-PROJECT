[CLS] mina ##rdi was an italian automobile racing team and construct ##or founded in fae ##nza in 1979 by gia ##nca ##rl ##o mina ##rdi . [SEP]
[CLS] it competed in the formula one world championship from 1985 until 2005 with little success , nevertheless acquiring a loyal following of fans . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2001 , to save the team from folding , mina ##rdi sold it to australian businessman paul st ##od ##dar ##t , who ran the team for five years before selling it on to red bull gmbh in 2005 who renamed it sc ##uder ##ia toro ross ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] from 2001 , all of mina ##rdi chassis are called " ps " then a number , the ps being the initials of team owner , paul st ##od ##dar ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] during its time in f1 , the team scored a total of 38 championship points ; 16 of these were earned by the team ' s first driver , pier ##lu ##ig ##i martini . [SEP]
[CLS] martini also recorded the team ' s only front row start , qualifying 2nd at the 1990 united states grand prix , and he led a lap during the 1989 portuguese grand prix , the only time a mina ##rdi led a lap . [SEP]
[CLS] the team never achieved a podium finish , only managing three 4th - place finishes : martini twice in 1991 and christian fit ##tip ##aldi in 1993 . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 21 seasons , mina ##rdi entered 37 drivers . [SEP]
[CLS] thirteen had italian nationality , the others came with 13 different nationalities ( discount ##ing door ##nb ##os racing under a monaco license in 2005 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] martini started in 103 grand ##s prix for the team , while mor ##bid ##elli and gene started 33 times . [SEP]
[CLS] before mina ##rdi ' s demise , the team was a particularly well - liked team within formula one circles for its friend ##liness , accessibility , and lack of corporate culture . [SEP]
[CLS] on the track , their cars were regarded by many as well - designed for their tiny budget , their low position recognised as a result of a lack of funds ( and engine power ) rather than a poor car . [SEP]
[CLS] they also resisted employing pay - drivers more than most other financially strapped teams . [SEP]
[CLS] former mina ##rdi drivers include double world champion fernando alonso , grand ##s prix winners alessandro nan ##nin ##i , gia ##nca ##rl ##o fis ##iche ##lla , jar ##no tr ##ull ##i and mark webber ; cart indy ##car world series double champion alessandro za ##nard ##i and race winners justin wilson and christian fit ##tip ##aldi ; and 24 hours of le mans overall winners michele al ##bor ##eto and marc gene . [SEP]
[CLS] the mina ##rdi family has a long ##standing involvement in motorsport . [SEP]
[CLS] gia ##nca ##rl ##o mina ##rdi ' s grandfather had a fiat dealers ##hip in fae ##nza since 1927 , while his father , giovanni mina ##rdi , competed in his own cars in the late 1940s . [SEP]
[CLS] after his death , gia ##nca ##rl ##o took over the racing part of the family business . [SEP]
[CLS] he ran customer cars in formula two under the name sc ##uder ##ia everest from 1972 to 1979 and in 1976 briefly ran a customer formula one ferrari 312 ##t with gia ##nca ##rl ##o martini , uncle of pier ##lu ##ig ##i martini . [SEP]
[CLS] martini sr . qualified 15th for the race of champions at brands hatch but failed to start the race after an accident during the opening lap . [SEP]
[CLS] the team then competed at the br ##dc international trophy in silver ##stone where martini finished 10th . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1979 mina ##rdi received financial backing from well known italian motor racing patron pier ##o man ##cini and set up the mina ##rdi racing team as a formula two construct ##or . [SEP]
[CLS] the team first competed under the mina ##rdi name in the 1980 european formula two championship . [SEP]
[CLS] rather than using a customer chassis , the team commissioned a bmw powered design from giacomo cal ##iri ' s fly studios â€” previously responsible for the fit ##tip ##aldi automotive team ' s f ##5 ##a formula one car . [SEP]
[CLS] mina ##rdi enjoyed four moderately successful formula two seasons with a variety of young italian and south american drivers , including alessandro nan ##nin ##i and johnny ce ##cott ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] the team ' s most notable result was a 1981 win at the mis ##ano round by michele al ##bor ##eto . [SEP]
[CLS] mina ##rdi left the lower division at the end of 1984 , although in 1986 a modified version of their final formula two car , the 283 , was entered without success in two rounds of the formula 3000 championship which had replaced formula two in 1985 . [SEP]
[CLS] during 1984 , mina ##rdi took the decision to enter formula one the following year . [SEP]
[CLS] cal ##iri designed the m1 ##8 ##4 , the team ' s prototype formula one car ( intended as a dual purpose design for the new formula 3000 ) around alfa romeo ' s v8 turbo ##charged engine but when engineer carlo chi ##ti left alfa romeo to found motor ##i modern ##i , mina ##rdi became the only customer for his new v6 engine design . [SEP]
[CLS] the engine was not ready for the start of the season , so the team converted their m1 ##85 chassis to accept a co ##sworth d ##f ##v engine for the first two races . [SEP]
[CLS] the single car team was unsuccessful in its first year , scoring no points . [SEP]
[CLS] the new engine was under ##powered and driver pier ##lu ##ig ##i martini finished only two races , although he was also classified 11th at the german grand prix despite stopping with engine problems . [SEP]
[CLS] martini ' s best position was 8th in the 1985 australian grand prix , behind hu ##ub roth ##eng ##atter in an os ##ella . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , the team expanded to two cars for the season . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1988 mina ##rdi switched to co ##sworth engines , and in 1989 it became top en ##tra ##nt for pi ##relli ' s return to formula one . [SEP]
[CLS] the team was moderately successful in the midfield through the late 1980s and early 1990s , giving a succession of italian drivers their first chance at the top level , including alessandro nan ##nin ##i , pier ##lu ##ig ##i martini and gia ##nni mor ##bid ##elli . [SEP]
[CLS] martini in particular was synonymous with mina ##rdi , eventually having three spells with the team . [SEP]
[CLS] he drove for them on their debut in 1985 , scored their first point in the 1988 united states grand prix , although he had been running 5th for quite a long time during the race until being passed by ty ##rrell ' s jonathan palmer , took their only front - row start at 1990 usa grand prix ( aided by special pi ##relli tyres ; several of their other drivers had surprise qualifying results that day ) , their only lap leading a race in the 1989 portuguese grand prix , where he finished 5th , and scored their joint - best f1 result up to that point ( the other being at the british grand prix the same year ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1991 mina ##rdi became the first team in modern times to make use of customer engines from ferrari and in 1992 they used lamb ##org ##hini v ##12 ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1993 mina ##rdi enjoyed a good campaign , collecting seven points thanks to christian fit ##tip ##aldi ' s fourth place in the 1993 south african grand prix and fifth place in the 1993 monaco grand prix and fa ##bri ##zio bar ##ba ##zza sixth places in the 1993 european grand prix and 1993 san marino grand prix . [SEP]
[CLS] as the number of small teams sh ##rank , mina ##rdi slipped from the mid - field towards the back of the grid . [SEP]
[CLS] money wo ##es hit and in 1994 mina ##rdi joined his team with b ##ms sc ##uder ##ia italia in an effort to survive . [SEP]
[CLS] gia ##nca ##rl ##o mina ##rdi retained 14 . 5 % with the remaining 85 . 5 % distributed between the sc ##uder ##ia italia investors ( emilio gnu ##tti , giuseppe luc ##chin ##i and vittorio pal ##az ##zan ##i ) and defend ##ente mar ##nig ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1994 martini finished 5th at both the 1994 spanish grand prix and 1994 french grand prix , while michele al ##bor ##eto scored his last point in formula 1 with a 6th place in the 1994 monaco grand prix . [SEP]
[CLS] acknowledging that the team was struggling , bernie ec ##cles ##tone spoke to fl ##avio br ##ia ##tore , who agreed to buy a share in the team in 1995 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1996 italian businessman gabriel ##e rum ##i , former owner of the fond ##met ##al team switched his sponsorship support from ty ##rrell to mina ##rdi . [SEP]
[CLS] he gradually increased his interest in the fae ##nza outfit , becoming co - owner and chairman . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1997 mina ##rdi teamed up with engine manufacturer brian hart . [SEP]
[CLS] for the season the team were forced to use 1998 - spec ford ze ##tec - r v ##10 engines , which were re ##bad ##ged as fond ##met ##al engines in def ##erence to his financial input . [SEP]
[CLS] however , rum ##i ' s poor health forced him to withdraw his backing at the end of the season . [SEP]
[CLS] points were rare during this time ; pedro lam ##y scored his one and only point in formula 1 with a 6th place in the 1995 australian grand prix ; this result was followed by a long barren spell until marc gene finished 6th in the 1999 european grand prix . [SEP]
[CLS] that same race , luca bad ##oe ##r had been running fourth until his gearbox failed with 13 laps to go , at which point the italian burst into tears next to his stricken car . [SEP]
[CLS] other mina ##rdi drivers also came close to scoring points , including shin ##ji nak ##ano who finished 7th at the 1998 canadian grand prix and este ##ban tu ##ero , who finished 8th at the 1998 san marino grand prix . [SEP]
[CLS] mina ##rdi was known for not using pay drivers , but for the 2000 season , the team signed argent ##inian gaston ma ##zza ##can ##e , who only acquired the seat thanks to backing from the short - lived pay television channel pan - american sports network . [SEP]
[CLS] the team , now near collapse , was purchased by australian businessman paul st ##od ##dar ##t in early 2001 , merging it with his european racing formula 3000 team . [SEP]
[CLS] during this time mina ##rdi gave fernando alonso his debut , despite being unable to score any points for mina ##rdi he gave a good impression , subsequently he moved to renault for the 2002 season . [SEP]
[CLS] mina ##rdi ' s performance at the 2002 australian grand prix ended up to be particularly successful , with australian driver mark webber ' s bringing the car home in 5th place in his first formula one race and malaysian pay driver alex yoon ##g finishing 7th . [SEP]
[CLS] another memorable episode happened during the 2003 brazilian grand prix . [SEP]
[CLS] the race was stopped just after 75 % distance , after treacherous weather and a sequence of accidents , including a spin into the grass for lead mina ##rdi driver jo ##s ve ##rst ##app ##en . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##od ##dar ##t later claimed that ve ##rst ##app ##en had enough fuel on board to last until just after the time the red flag was eventually waved , due to the large number of safety car laps . [SEP]
[CLS] assuming st ##od ##dar ##t is being truth ##ful , ve ##rst ##app ##en may well have won this race had he not spun . [SEP]
[CLS] during its final years , the mina ##rdi team was almost as famous for its politics as its racing . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##od ##dar ##t was described as the formula one teams ' unofficial shop steward . [SEP]
[CLS] during his time as team principal , st ##od ##dar ##t campaigned for reduced costs in the sport . [SEP]
[CLS] he appealed to the competing car manufacturers for an agreement where the independent ( and , on the whole , financially weaker ) teams in formula one would get cheaper engine deals than at present . [SEP]
[CLS] in return , the team principals who would benefit from this would support the works teams when it came to opposing new rule changes enforced by the fia , such as the proposed ban on traction control . [SEP]
[CLS] before the start of the 2004 season , however , st ##od ##dar ##t threatened to withdraw his support against the ban on traction control , but later changed his mind . [SEP]
[CLS] midway through the 2004 season , the other teams voted to change the unpopular single lap qualifying system back to the old 1 hour format , but st ##od ##dar ##t voted against because it would also mean the 107 % rule being reintroduced ; this meant the change never occurred , as a unanimous vote was required to change something so significant in the middle of a season . [SEP]
[CLS] before the 2005 australian grand prix st ##od ##dar ##t initially threatened to withdraw his cars if they were made to comply with the revised regulations for 2005 . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##od ##dar ##t claimed that mina ##rdi could not afford to adapt their cars . [SEP]
[CLS] once again st ##od ##dar ##t ended up withdrawing his threat . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##od ##dar ##t has also repeatedly called for the resignation of the fia ' s president , max mo ##sley , particularly in the aftermath of the 2005 united states grand prix where the majority of teams withdrew from the race due to safety concerns about their michel ##in tyres . [SEP]
[CLS] while mina ##rdi had run bridges ##tone tyres , st ##od ##dar ##t had offered to compromise with the michel ##in teams but mo ##sley had rejected it . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2004 mina ##rdi was represented by two rookie ##s , italian gia ##n ##mar ##ia " gi ##mm ##i " br ##uni and hungarian z ##sol ##t ba ##um ##gart ##ner . [SEP]
[CLS] during the year , they celebrated their 20th season in f1 . [SEP]
[CLS] ba ##um ##gart ##ner scored mina ##rdi ' s first point in more than 2 years at the united states grand prix , finishing 8th ( only 8 cars finished the 2004 us ##gp ) . [SEP]
[CLS] ba ##um ##gart ##ner was also the first hungarian to score a point in a world championship f1 race . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2005 , mina ##rdi ' s drivers were christi ##jan al ##bers and patrick fries ##ache ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] they amassed a total of 7 points following the de ##ba ##cle of the 2005 united states grand prix , in which they finished fifth and sixth ( of six runners ) respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] after losing financial backing from his sponsors before the 2005 german grand prix , patrick fries ##ache ##r was replaced by dutch jordan test driver robert door ##nb ##os , creating the first all - dutch driver line - up in formula one since care ##l god ##in de beaufort and ben po ##n drove together for the ec ##uri ##e ma ##ars ##berg ##en team at the 1962 dutch grand prix at za ##nd ##vo ##ort . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2005 , paul st ##od ##dar ##t stated that he would sell mina ##rdi if he could find the right buyer . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##od ##dar ##t claimed that he had 41 approaches . [SEP]
[CLS] his criterion for a sale was the ability of a buyer to move the team forward and leave the team based in fae ##nza . [SEP]
[CLS] the drinks manufacturer red bull gmbh , which already owned another formula one team , red bull racing , decided to set up a second team to promote american drivers that had risen through its young driver programme , red bull driver search . [SEP]
[CLS] ending several weeks of speculation on 10 september 2005 red bull announced it would take control of mina ##rdi in november and run it as their " rookie team " from 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] mina ##rdi fans worldwide immediately started an online petition to save the mina ##rdi team name and the team ' s 20 - year heritage in f1 after the news broke . [SEP]
[CLS] the petition was not successful and the team was renamed sc ##uder ##ia toro ross ##o for the 2006 season . [SEP]
[CLS] the greatly increased funding from red bull , including the use of the red bull chassis and ferrari engines , gradually led to improved results , culminating in toro ross ##o ' s maiden win at the 2008 italian grand prix . [SEP]
[CLS] gia ##nca ##rl ##o mina ##rdi and paul st ##od ##dar ##t have both made use of the mina ##rdi name in new motorsport ventures . [SEP]
[CLS] on 1 january 2006 , gia ##nca ##rl ##o mina ##rdi re - acquired certain rights to use the mina ##rdi name in racing . [SEP]
[CLS] he also announced that he was licensing the mina ##rdi name to established team gp racing in the junior euro formula 3000 series , to be entitled ' mina ##rdi team by gp racing ' . [SEP]
[CLS] the team raced with moderate success , scoring a podium in each leg of the spa round in june 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] for 2007 , mina ##rdi team by gp racing combined forces with gp ##2 team pi ##quet sports , to form mina ##rdi pi ##quet sports . [SEP]
[CLS] for 2008 the team was known simply as pi ##quet sports . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2006 , paul st ##od ##dar ##t declared his intention to enter a new team called ' european mina ##rdi f1 team ltd ' into formula one beginning in . [SEP]
[CLS] his application was unsuccessful , with the 12th place on the grid being awarded to pro ##drive . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , st ##od ##dar ##t turned his attention ##s to the u . s . - based champ car series . [SEP]
[CLS] on 18 december 2006 , it was confirmed that he had purchased a controlling interest in the ct ##e racing - h ##v ##m champ car team and that the team would be renamed mina ##rdi team usa . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2007 , the team had reasonable success . [SEP]
[CLS] robert door ##nb ##os took two wins and several podium places on his way to third in the series , winning rookie of the year honours . [SEP]
[CLS] when the series folded before its planned 2008 season , st ##od ##dar ##t ' s involvement ceased , with the team entering the indy ##car series under the h ##v ##m name . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##od ##dar ##t retains the right to use the mina ##rdi name for a british - registered company . [SEP]
