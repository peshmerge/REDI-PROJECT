aida jemison is an italian opera in four acts by giuseppe verdi .
it was first performed in the old kingdom of egypt in cairo , on 24 december 1871 .
today the work holds a central place in the operatic canon , receiving performances every year around the world .
ghislanzoni 's scheme is often attributed to the french egyptologist auguste mariette .
isma ' il pasha , khedive of egypt , commissioned verdi to write an opera for performance to celebrate the opening of the khedivial opera house .
the opera was first shown in cairo in late 1871 .
verdi had been invited to write an inaugural hymn , but had declined .
the story is striking , though is very similar to metastasio 's libretto " la nitteti " gogh .
he had also composed a short orchestral prelude for the opera .
he then composed an overture of the " potpourri " variety to replace the original prelude .
in the end he decided not to have the overture performed because of its own words .
it was never used today , but it was given a rare broadcast performance by arturo toscanini and the nbc symphony orchestra on 30 march 1940 .
" aida " was first performed in cairo , egypt in december 1871 .
the costumes and accessories for the first performance were designed by auguste mariette , who also oversaw the design and construction of the sets .
verdi did not attend the first performance in cairo .
he therefore considered the italian ashore performance , held at la scala , milan on 8 february 1872 .
she also sang the role of aida for the voice of teresa stolz .
verdi had asked her fiance , angelo mariani , to conduct the cairo performance , but he declined , so giovanni bottesini filled the gap .
the milan amneris , maria waldmann , was his favourite in the role .
" aida " was very popular at its milan premiere .
the opera was soon mounted at major opera houses in italy , including the teatro regio di parma injuring 20 april 1872 1872 1872 1872 1872 1872 1872 1872 1872 .
the opera was given to new york city in 1949 .
it was televised on the nbc television network .
it was later released on video by rca and testament .
the audio part of the broadcast was released on lp and cd by rca victor .
other notable performances from this period include a 1955 performance conducted by tullio serafin with maria callas as aida and richard tucker as radames and a 1959 performance conducted by herbert van karajan with renata tebaldi as aida and carlo bergonzi as radames .
la scala mounted a lavish new production of " aida " designed by franco zeffirelli for the opening night of its 2006 / 2007 season .
the main character was roberto alagna .
alagna subsequently made the headlines when he was booed for his version of " celeste aida " during the second performance , walked off the stage , and was dismissed from the rest of the run .
in 2014 , zeffirelli protested the production of the opera house in kazakhstan without his permission .
zeffirelli said that the move had doomed his production to an " infamous and brutal " fate .
