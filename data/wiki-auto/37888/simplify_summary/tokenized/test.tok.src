[CLS] aid ##a ( ] ) is an opera in four acts by giuseppe verdi to an italian libretto by antonio g ##his ##lan ##zon ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] set in the old kingdom of egypt , it was commissioned by cairo ' s k ##hed ##iv ##ial opera house and had its premiere there on 24 december 1871 , in a performance conducted by giovanni bot ##tes ##ini . [SEP]
[CLS] today the work holds a central place in the operatic canon , receiving performances every year around the world ; at new york ' s metropolitan opera alone , " aid ##a " has been sung more than 1 , 100 times since 1886 . [SEP]
[CLS] g ##his ##lan ##zon ##i ' s scheme follows a scenario often attributed to the french egypt ##ologist auguste marie ##tte , but verdi biographer mary jane phillips - mat ##z argues that the source is actually te ##mist ##oc ##le sole ##ra . [SEP]
[CLS] is ##ma ' il pasha , k ##hed ##ive of egypt , commissioned verdi to write an opera for performance to celebrate the opening of the k ##hed ##iv ##ial opera house , paying him 150 , 000 francs , but the premiere was delayed because of the siege of paris ( 1870 – 71 ) , during the franco - prussian war , when the scenery and costumes were stuck in the french capital , and verdi ' s " rig ##ole ##tto " was performed instead . [SEP]
[CLS] " aid ##a " eventually premiered in cairo in late 1871 . [SEP]
[CLS] contrary to popular belief , the opera was not written to celebrate the opening of the suez canal in 1869 , for which verdi had been invited to write an inaugural hymn , but had declined . [SEP]
[CLS] the plot bears striking , though un ##int ##ent ##ional , similarities to meta ##sta ##sio ' s libretto " la ni ##tte ##ti " ( 1756 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] verdi originally chose to write a brief orchestral prelude instead of a full overture for the opera . [SEP]
[CLS] he then composed an overture of the " pot ##pour ##ri " variety to replace the original prelude . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in the end he decided not to have the overture performed because of its — his own words — " pre ##ten ##tious ins ##ip ##idi ##ty " . [SEP]
[CLS] this overture , never used today , was given a rare broadcast performance by arturo to ##scan ##ini and the nbc symphony orchestra on 30 march 1940 , but was never commercially issued . [SEP]
[CLS] " aid ##a " met with great acclaim when it finally opened in cairo on 24 december 1871 . [SEP]
[CLS] the costumes and accessories for the premiere were designed by auguste marie ##tte , who also oversaw the design and construction of the sets , which were made in paris by the opera ' s scene painters auguste - alfred rub ##e and philippe cha ##per ##on ( acts 1 and 4 ) and edouard des ##ple ##chin and jean - baptiste lava ##st ##re ( acts 2 and 3 ) , and shipped to cairo . [SEP]
[CLS] although verdi did not attend the premiere in cairo , he was most dissatisfied with the fact that the audience consisted of invited dignitaries , politicians and critics , but no members of the general public . [SEP]
[CLS] he therefore considered the italian ( and european ) premiere , held at la scala , milan on 8 february 1872 , and a performance in which he was heavily involved at every stage , to be its " real " premiere . [SEP]
[CLS] verdi had also written the role of aid ##a for the voice of teresa st ##ol ##z , who sang it for the first time at the milan premiere . [SEP]
[CLS] verdi had asked her fiance , angelo marian ##i , to conduct the cairo premiere , but he declined , so giovanni bot ##tes ##ini filled the gap . [SEP]
[CLS] the milan am ##ner ##is , maria wal ##dman ##n , was his favourite in the role and she repeated it a number of times at his request . [SEP]
[CLS] " aid ##a " was received with great enthusiasm at its milan premiere . [SEP]
[CLS] the opera was soon mounted at major opera houses throughout italy , including the teatro reg ##io di parma ( 20 april 1872 ) , the teatro di san carlo ( 30 march 1873 ) , la fen ##ice ( 11 june 1873 ) , the teatro reg ##io di torino ( 26 december 1874 ) , the teatro com ##una ##le di bologna ( 30 september 1877 , with gi ##use ##pp ##ina pas ##qua as am ##ner ##is and franco nova ##ra as the king ) , and the teatro costa ##nz ##i ( 8 october 1881 , with there ##sia singer as aid ##a and gi ##ulia novel ##li as am ##ner ##is ) among others . [SEP]
[CLS] a complete concert version of the opera was given in new york city in 1949 . [SEP]
[CLS] conducted by to ##scan ##ini with her ##va nell ##i as aid ##a and richard tucker as ra ##dam ##es , it was televised on the nbc television network . [SEP]
[CLS] due to the length of the opera , it was divided into two telecast ##s , preserved on kin ##es ##cope ##s , and later released on video by rca and testament . [SEP]
[CLS] the audio portion of the broadcast , including some remake ##s in june 1954 , was released on lp and cd by rca victor . [SEP]
[CLS] other notable performances from this period include a 1955 performance conducted by tu ##lli ##o sera ##fin with maria call ##as as aid ##a and richard tucker as ra ##dam ##es and a 1959 performance conducted by herbert van kara ##jan with ren ##ata te ##baldi as aid ##a and carlo berg ##on ##zi as ra ##dam ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] la scala mounted a lavish new production of " aid ##a " designed by franco ze ##ffi ##relli for the opening night of its 2006 / 2007 season . [SEP]
[CLS] the production starred violet ##a ur ##mana in the title role and roberto ala ##gna as ra ##dam ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] ala ##gna subsequently made the headlines when he was boo ##ed for his rendition of " celeste aid ##a " during the second performance , walked off the stage , and was dismissed from the remainder of the run . [SEP]
[CLS] the production continued to cause controversy in 2014 when ze ##ffi ##relli protested la scala ' s rental of the production to the as ##tana opera house in kazakhstan without his permission . [SEP]
[CLS] according to ze ##ffi ##relli , the move had doomed his production to an " infamous and brutal " fate . [SEP]
[CLS] " aid ##a " continues to be a staple of the standard operatic repertoire . [SEP]
[CLS] it is frequently performed in the verona arena , and is a staple of its renowned opera festival . [SEP]
[CLS] the libretto does not specify a precise time period , so it is difficult to place the opera more specifically than the old kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] for the first production , marie ##tte went to great efforts to make the sets and costumes authentic . [SEP]
[CLS] given the consistent artistic styles throughout the 3000 - year history of ancient egypt , a given production does not particularly need to choose a specific time period within the larger frame of ancient egyptian history . [SEP]
