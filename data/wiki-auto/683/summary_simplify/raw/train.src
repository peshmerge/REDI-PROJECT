An adventure is an exciting experience that is typically a bold, sometimes risky, undertaking.
Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained in a risky manner.
Similarly, Helen Keller stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."
Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers â€“ the British adventurer Jason Lewis, for example, uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren.
Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as Homer's "The Odyssey".
The adventure novel exhibits these "protagonist on adventurous journey" characteristics as do many popular feature films, such as "Star Wars" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark".
Adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the wilderness or Mother Nature.
These books are less about "questing", such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.
Many adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a skill, prize, or perhaps the safety of a person.
Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the "call to adventure", followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph.
In video-game culture, an adventure game is a video game in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle-solving.
The genre's focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative-based media, literature and film, encompassing a wide variety of literary genres.
Many adventure games (text and graphic) are designed for a single player, since this emphasis on story and character makes multi-player design difficult.
Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as Marco Polo's journal "The Travels of Marco Polo" or Mark Twain's "Roughing It".
There are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question, such as "The Right Stuff" by Tom Wolfe, or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such as "Conquistadors of the Useless" by Lionel Terray.
There are many sports classified as adventure sports, due to their inherent danger and excitement.
Some of these include mountain climbing, skydiving, or other extreme sports.
