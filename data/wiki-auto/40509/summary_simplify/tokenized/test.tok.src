[CLS] no candidate won a majority of the electoral vote , becoming the only election to require a contingent election in the house of representatives under the provisions of the 12th amendment . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the first election in which the winner did not achieve at least a plurality of the national popular vote . [SEP]
[CLS] senator andrew jackson , house speaker henry clay , and secretary of state adams all joined crawford in seeking the presidency , highlighting faction ##alis ##m within the party and an end to the era of good feelings . [SEP]
[CLS] jackson finished with a plurality of the electoral and popular vote , while the other three candidates each finished with a significant share of the votes . [SEP]
[CLS] calhoun became the " de facto " running mate of adams and as such was elected with a comfortable majority of the vice presidential vote in the electoral college . [SEP]
[CLS] influential within the contingent election , clay threw his support behind adams , who shared many of his positions on the major issues . [SEP]
[CLS] the era of good feelings associated with the administration of president james monroe was a time of reduced emphasis on political party identity . [SEP]
[CLS] the economic nationalism of the era of good feelings that would author ##ize the tariff of 1816 and incorporate the second bank of the united states porte ##nded abandonment of the jefferson ##ian political formula for strict construction of the constitution , limited central government , and prima ##cy of southern agrarian interests . [SEP]
[CLS] monroe attempted to improve discipline by appointing leading states ##men to his cabinet , including secretary of state john quincy adams of massachusetts , secretary of the treasury william h . crawford of georgia , and secretary of war john c . calhoun of south carolina . [SEP]
[CLS] only house speaker henry clay of kentucky held political power independent of monroe . [SEP]
[CLS] he refused to join the cabinet and remained critical of the administration . [SEP]
[CLS] two key events , the panic of 1819 and the missouri crisis of 1820 , influenced and res ##ha ##ped politics . [SEP]
[CLS] the economic down ##turn broadly harmed workers , the sectional disputes over slavery expansion raised tensions , and both events plus other factors drove demand for increased democratic control . [SEP]
[CLS] social di ##sa ##ffe ##ction would help mo ##tiv ##ate revival of rival ##rous political parties in the near future , though these had not yet formed at the time of the 1824 election . [SEP]
[CLS] president james monroe of the democratic - republicans was able to run without opposition in the election of 1820 . [SEP]
[CLS] like previous presidents who had been elected to two terms , monroe declined to seek re - nomination for a third term . [SEP]
[CLS] vice president daniel d . tom ##pkins was considered une ##le ##ctable due to his overwhelming unpopular ##ity and major health problems . [SEP]
[CLS] the presidential nomination was thus left wide open within the democratic - republican party , the only major national political entity remaining in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] the congressional caucus nominated crawford for president and albert gall ##atin for vice president , but it was sparsely attended and was widely attacked as und ##em ##oc ##ratic . [SEP]
[CLS] gall ##atin was also dissatisfied with repeated attacks on his credibility made by the other candidates . [SEP]
[CLS] andrew jackson was recruited to run for the office of the president by the state legislature of tennessee . [SEP]
[CLS] however , jackson was not one to decline such a request . [SEP]
[CLS] adams dominated the popular vote in new england and won some support elsewhere , clay dominated his home state of kentucky and won plural ##ities in two neighboring states , and crawford won the virginia vote overwhelmingly and polled well in north carolina . [SEP]
[CLS] jackson had geographically the broad ##est support , though there were heavy vote concentrations in his home state of tennessee and in pennsylvania and populous areas where even he ran poorly . [SEP]
[CLS] policy played a reduced role in the election , though positions on tariffs and internal improvements did create significant disagreements . [SEP]
[CLS] in reality , calhoun was ve ##hem ##ently opposed to nearly all of adams ' s policies , but he did nothing to di ##ss ##ua ##de adams supporters from voting for him for vice president . [SEP]
[CLS] contra ##fa ##cta , or well known songs and tunes whose lyrics have been altered , were used to promote political agenda ##s and presidential candidates . [SEP]
[CLS] contra ##fa ##cta such as this one , which promoted andrew jackson as a national hero , have been a long - standing tradition in presidential elections . [SEP]
[CLS] presidential candidate john c . calhoun was one of the candidates most directly involved through his participation in the publishing of the newspaper " the patriot " as a member of the editorial staff . [SEP]
[CLS] instead it was left to volunteer citizens and partisans to speak on their behalf . [SEP]
[CLS] the electoral map confirmed the candidates ' sectional support , with adams winning in new england , jackson having wide voter appeal , clay attracting votes from the west , and crawford attracting votes from the eastern south . [SEP]
[CLS] with no electoral majority , a contingent election was performed in the u . s . house of representatives . [SEP]
[CLS] following the provisions of the 12th amendment , the top three candidates by electoral votes were admitted as candidates in the house : andrew jackson , john quincy adams , and william crawford . [SEP]
[CLS] clay det ##ested jackson and had said of him , " i cannot believe that killing 2 , 500 english ##men at new orleans qu ##ali ##fies for the various , difficult , and complicated duties of the chief mag ##ist ##rac ##y . " [SEP]
[CLS] even had clay wished to align with crawford ( which would ' ve been even more politically unlikely than an alliance with jackson since clay ' s policy differences with crawford were even deeper , especially on matters of the tariff as well as crawford ' s known ill health ) , no path to victory was evident . [SEP]
[CLS] ignoring the non ##bin ##ding directive of the kentucky legislature that its house delegation choose jackson , clay would use his political influence in the house to mo ##tiv ##ate house delegation ##s in states where he had won at least a voting plurality to vote for adams . [SEP]
[CLS] not long before the contingent house election , an anonymous statement appeared in a philadelphia paper , called the " columbian observer " . [SEP]
[CLS] no formal investigation was conducted , so the matter was neither confirmed nor denied . [SEP]
[CLS] when clay was indeed offered the position after adams was victorious , he opted to accept and continue to support the administration he voted for , knowing that declining the position would not have helped to di ##sp ##el the rumors brought against him . [SEP]
[CLS] by appointing clay his secretary of state , president adams essentially declared him heir to the presidency , as adams and his three predecessors had all served as secretary of state . [SEP]
[CLS] the jackson ##ians would campaign on this claim for the next four years , ultimately helping jackson defeat adams in 1828 . [SEP]
