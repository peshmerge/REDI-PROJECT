No candidate won a majority of the electoral vote, becoming the only election to require a contingent election in the House of Representatives under the provisions of the 12th Amendment.
It was the first election in which the winner did not achieve at least a plurality of the national popular vote.
Senator Andrew Jackson, House Speaker Henry Clay, and Secretary of State Adams all joined Crawford in seeking the presidency, highlighting factionalism within the party and an end to the Era of Good Feelings.
Jackson finished with a plurality of the electoral and popular vote, while the other three candidates each finished with a significant share of the votes.
Calhoun became the "de facto" running mate of Adams and as such was elected with a comfortable majority of the vice presidential vote in the Electoral College.
Influential within the contingent election, Clay threw his support behind Adams, who shared many of his positions on the major issues.
The Era of Good Feelings associated with the administration of President James Monroe was a time of reduced emphasis on political party identity.
The economic nationalism of the Era of Good Feelings that would authorize the Tariff of 1816 and incorporate the Second Bank of the United States portended abandonment of the Jeffersonian political formula for strict construction of the Constitution, limited central government, and primacy of Southern agrarian interests.
Monroe attempted to improve discipline by appointing leading statesmen to his Cabinet, including Secretary of State John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts, Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford of Georgia, and Secretary of War John C. Calhoun of South Carolina.
Only House Speaker Henry Clay of Kentucky held political power independent of Monroe.
He refused to join the cabinet and remained critical of the administration.
Two key events, the Panic of 1819 and the Missouri crisis of 1820, influenced and reshaped politics.
The economic downturn broadly harmed workers, the sectional disputes over slavery expansion raised tensions, and both events plus other factors drove demand for increased democratic control.
Social disaffection would help motivate revival of rivalrous political parties in the near future, though these had not yet formed at the time of the 1824 election.
President James Monroe of the Democratic-Republicans was able to run without opposition in the election of 1820.
Like previous presidents who had been elected to two terms, Monroe declined to seek re-nomination for a third term.
Vice President Daniel D. Tompkins was considered unelectable due to his overwhelming unpopularity and major health problems.
The presidential nomination was thus left wide open within the Democratic-Republican Party, the only major national political entity remaining in the United States.
The Congressional caucus nominated Crawford for president and Albert Gallatin for vice president, but it was sparsely attended and was widely attacked as undemocratic.
Gallatin was also dissatisfied with repeated attacks on his credibility made by the other candidates.
Andrew Jackson was recruited to run for the office of the president by the state legislature of Tennessee.
However, Jackson was not one to decline such a request.
Adams dominated the popular vote in New England and won some support elsewhere, Clay dominated his home state of Kentucky and won pluralities in two neighboring states, and Crawford won the Virginia vote overwhelmingly and polled well in North Carolina.
Jackson had geographically the broadest support, though there were heavy vote concentrations in his home state of Tennessee and in Pennsylvania and populous areas where even he ran poorly.
Policy played a reduced role in the election, though positions on tariffs and internal improvements did create significant disagreements.
In reality, Calhoun was vehemently opposed to nearly all of Adams's policies, but he did nothing to dissuade Adams supporters from voting for him for vice president.
Contrafacta, or well known songs and tunes whose lyrics have been altered, were used to promote political agendas and presidential candidates.
Contrafacta such as this one, which promoted Andrew Jackson as a national hero, have been a long-standing tradition in presidential elections.
Presidential candidate John C. Calhoun was one of the candidates most directly involved through his participation in the publishing of the newspaper "The Patriot" as a member of the editorial staff.
Instead it was left to volunteer citizens and partisans to speak on their behalf.
The electoral map confirmed the candidates' sectional support, with Adams winning in New England, Jackson having wide voter appeal, Clay attracting votes from the West, and Crawford attracting votes from the eastern South.
With no electoral majority, a contingent election was performed in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Following the provisions of the 12th Amendment, the top three candidates by electoral votes were admitted as candidates in the House: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and William Crawford.
Clay detested Jackson and had said of him, "I cannot believe that killing 2,500 Englishmen at New Orleans qualifies for the various, difficult, and complicated duties of the Chief Magistracy."
Even had Clay wished to align with Crawford (which would've been even more politically unlikely than an alliance with Jackson since Clay's policy differences with Crawford were even deeper, especially on matters of the tariff as well as Crawford's known ill health), no path to victory was evident.
Ignoring the nonbinding directive of the Kentucky legislature that its House delegation choose Jackson, Clay would use his political influence in the House to motivate House delegations in states where he had won at least a voting plurality to vote for Adams.
Not long before the contingent House election, an anonymous statement appeared in a Philadelphia paper, called the "Columbian Observer".
No formal investigation was conducted, so the matter was neither confirmed nor denied.
When Clay was indeed offered the position after Adams was victorious, he opted to accept and continue to support the administration he voted for, knowing that declining the position would not have helped to dispel the rumors brought against him.
By appointing Clay his Secretary of State, President Adams essentially declared him heir to the presidency, as Adams and his three predecessors had all served as Secretary of State.
The Jacksonians would campaign on this claim for the next four years, ultimately helping Jackson defeat Adams in 1828.
