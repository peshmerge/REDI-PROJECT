in may 1945 , the soviet union appointed a city government for the whole city that was called " magistrate of greater berlin " , which existed until 1947 .
after the war , allied forces controlled the city together in the allied kommandatura .
however , in 1948 the soviet representative left the kommandatura and the common administration broke apart during the next months .
in the soviet sector , a separate city government was created , which continued to call itself " magistrate of greater berlin " .
when the german democratic republic was formed in 1949 , it immediately claimed east berlin as its capital .
its representatives were not directly elected and did not have full voting rights until 1981 .
in june 1948 , all railways and roads leading to west berlin were blocked .

in december 1990 , the first “ all berlin ” mayor was elected to take office in january 1991 .
since reunification , the german government has spent lots of money on bringing services and infrastructure in the former east berlin up to the standard established in west berlin .
after the reunification , the east german economy suffered .
many east german factories were closed because they did not comply with west german pollution and safety standards .
because of this , a lot of west german economic aid was sent into east germany to revitalize it .
this stimulus was part-funded through a 7.5 % tax on income , which led to resentment toward the east germans .
