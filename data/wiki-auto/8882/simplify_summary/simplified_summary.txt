domnall mac ailpin was king of the picts from 858 to 862 .
he followed his brother kenneth i to the throne .
the laws of aed find are entirely lost , but it has been assumed that , like the laws attributed to giric and constantine ii temeraire , these related to the church and in particular to granting the privileges and immunities common elsewhere .
the significance of forteviot as the site of this law-making , together with kenneth 's death there and constantine 's later gathering at nearby scone , may point to this as being the heartland of the sons of alpin 's support .
the chronicle of melrose says of domnall , " in war he was a vigorous soldier . . he is said to have been assassinated at scone . "
no other source says domnall 's death by violence .
domnall died , probably at the junction of the almond and the tay , near scone ono onorth .
