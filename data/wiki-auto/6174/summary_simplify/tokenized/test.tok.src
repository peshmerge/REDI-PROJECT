[CLS] in mathematics , the cardinal ##ity of a set is a measure of the " number of elements of the set " . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the set formula _ 1 contains 3 elements , and therefore formula _ 2 has a cardinal ##ity of 3 . [SEP]
[CLS] the cardinal ##ity of a set is also called its size , when no confusion with other notions of size is possible . [SEP]
[CLS] the cardinal ##ity of a set formula _ 2 is usually denoted formula _ 4 , with a vertical bar on each side ; this is the same notation as absolute value and the meaning depends on context . [SEP]
[CLS] while the cardinal ##ity of a finite set is just the number of its elements , extending the notion to infinite sets usually starts with defining the notion of comparison of arbitrary ( possibly infinite ) sets . [SEP]
[CLS] the relation of having the same cardinal ##ity is called e ##quin ##ume ##ros ##ity , and this is an equivalence relation on the class of all sets . [SEP]
[CLS] the equivalence class of a set " a " under this relation then consists of all those sets which have the same cardinal ##ity as " a " . [SEP]
[CLS] assuming ac , the cardinal ##ities of the infinite sets are denoted for each or ##dina ##l formula _ 11 , formula _ 12 is the least cardinal number greater than formula _ 13 . [SEP]
[CLS] the cardinal ##ity of the natural numbers is denoted ale ##ph - null ( formula _ 14 ) , while the cardinal ##ity of the real numbers is denoted by " formula _ 15 " ( a lower ##case fra ##kt ##ur script " c " ) , and is also referred to as the cardinal ##ity of the continuum . [SEP]
[CLS] we can show that formula _ 17 , this also being the cardinal ##ity of the set of all subset ##s of the natural numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] there is no set whose cardinal ##ity is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] see below for more details on the cardinal ##ity of the continuum . [SEP]
[CLS] cantor introduced the cardinal numbers , and showed that ( according to his bi ##ject ##ion - based definition of size ) some infinite sets are greater than others . [SEP]
[CLS] the continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinal number between the cardinal ##ity of the real ##s and the cardinal ##ity of the natural numbers , that is , [SEP]
[CLS] however , this hypothesis can neither be proved nor di ##sp ##roved within the widely accepted z ##fc ax ##iom ##atic set theory , if z ##fc is consistent . [SEP]
[CLS] cardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a real number line is equal to the number of points in any segment of that line , but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and , indeed , in any finite - dimensional space . [SEP]
[CLS] these results are highly counter ##int ##uit ##ive , because they imply that there exist proper subset ##s and proper super ##set ##s of an infinite set " s " that have the same size as " s " , although " s " contains elements that do not belong to its subset ##s , and the super ##set ##s of " s " contain elements that are not included in it . [SEP]
[CLS] the first of these results is apparent by considering , for instance , the tangent function , which provides a one - to - one correspondence between the interval ( − ##1 ##⁄ ##2 ##π , 1 ##⁄ ##2 ##π ) and r ( see also hilbert ' s paradox of the grand hotel ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the second result was first demonstrated by cantor in 1878 , but it became more apparent in 1890 , when giuseppe pea ##no introduced the space - filling curves , curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square , or cube , or hyper ##cu ##be , or finite - dimensional space . [SEP]
[CLS] these curves are not a direct proof that a line has the same number of points as a finite - dimensional space , but they can be used to obtain such a proof . [SEP]
[CLS] if " a " and " b " are " di ##s ##jo ##int " sets , then [SEP]
[CLS] from this , one can show that in general the cardinal ##ities of unions and intersections are related by [SEP]
