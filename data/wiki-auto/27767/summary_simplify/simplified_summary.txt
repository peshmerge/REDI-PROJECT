standard-definition television appearances include sdtv and sdtv .
the two common sdtv signal types are 576i , with 576 interlaced lines of resolution .
in north america , digital sdtv is shown in the same 4 : 3 aspect ratio as ntsc signals , with widescreen content being center cut .
however , in other parts of the world that used the pal or secam color system , digital standard-definition television is now usually shown with a , with the transition between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s depending on region .
the table below summarizes pixel aspect ratios for the scaling of different kinds of sdtv video lines .
the pixel aspect ratio is always the same for corresponding 720 and 704 pixel resolutions .
the actual image depicting the image is 4 : 3 or 16 : 9 angular is always contained in the center 704 horizontal pixels of the digital frame , regardless of how many horizontal pixels altered 704 or 720ttes are used .
in case of digital video line having 720 horizontal pixels , only the center 704 pixels contain actual 4 : 3 or 16 : 9 image , and the 8-pixel-wide stripes from either side are called blanking for horizontal blanking and should be discarded before displaying the image .
overscan areas are part of the actual 4 : 3 or 16 : 9 image .
for smpte 259m-c compliance , a sdtv broadcast image is scaled to 720 pixels wide for every 480 ntscylus or 576 palcolor lines of the image with the amount of non-proportional line scaling dependent on either the display or pixel aspect ratio .
the sdtv image requires 640 pixels for every line of the image .
the display and pixel aspect ratio is generally not required .
