[CLS] standard - definition television ( sd ##tv or sd ) is a television system which uses a resolution that is not considered to be either high or enhanced definition . [SEP]
[CLS] the two common sd ##tv signal types are 57 ##6 ##i , with 57 ##6 inter ##lace ##d lines of resolution , derived from the european - developed pal and sec ##am systems , and 480 ##i based on the american nt ##sc system . [SEP]
[CLS] in north america , digital sd ##tv is broadcast in the same 4 : 3 aspect ratio as nt ##sc signals , with wide ##screen content being center cut . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in other parts of the world that used the pal or sec ##am color systems , digital standard - definition television is now usually shown with a , with the transition occurring between the mid - 1990s and mid - 2000s depending on region . [SEP]
[CLS] the table below sum ##mar ##izes pixel aspect ratios for the scaling of various kinds of sd ##tv video lines . [SEP]
[CLS] the pixel aspect ratio is always the same for corresponding 720 and 70 ##4 pixel resolutions because the center part of a 720 - pixel - wide image is equal to the corresponding 70 ##4 - pixel - wide image . [SEP]
[CLS] the actual image ( be it 4 : 3 or 16 : 9 ) is always contained in the center 70 ##4 horizontal pixels of the digital frame , regardless of how many horizontal pixels ( 70 ##4 or 720 ) are used . [SEP]
[CLS] in case of digital video line having 720 horizontal pixels , only the center 70 ##4 pixels contain actual 4 : 3 or 16 : 9 image , and the 8 - pixel - wide stripes from either side are called nominal analogue blank ##ing for horizontal blank ##ing and should be discarded before displaying the image . [SEP]
[CLS] nominal analogue blank ##ing should not be confused with overs ##can , as overs ##can areas are part of the actual 4 : 3 or 16 : 9 image . [SEP]
[CLS] for sm ##pt ##e 259 ##m - c compliance , a sd ##tv broadcast image is scaled to 720 pixels wide for every 480 nt ##sc ( or 57 ##6 pal ) lines of the image with the amount of non - proportional line scaling dependent on either the display or pixel aspect ratio . [SEP]
[CLS] an sd ##tv image outside the constraints of the sm ##pt ##e standards requires no non - proportional scaling with 640 pixels for every line of the image . [SEP]
[CLS] the display and pixel aspect ratio is generally not required with the line height defining the aspect . [SEP]
