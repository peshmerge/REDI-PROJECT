[CLS] the melbourne grand prix circuit is a street circuit around albert park lake , only a few kilometres south of central melbourne . [SEP]
[CLS] although the entire track consists of normally public roads , each sector includes medium to high speed characteristics more commonly associated with dedicated racetrack ##s facilitated by grass and gravel run - off safety zones that are reconstructed annually . [SEP]
[CLS] however the circuit also has characteristics of a street circuit ' s enclosed nature due to concrete barriers annually built along the lakeside drive curve , in particular , where run - off is not available due to the proximity of the lake shore . [SEP]
[CLS] the circuit uses everyday sections of road that circle albert park lake , a small man - altered lake ( originally a large lagoon formed as part of the ancient ya ##rra river course ) just south of the central business district of melbourne . [SEP]
[CLS] the road sections that are used were rebuilt prior to the inaugural event in 1996 to ensure consistency and smooth ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] before 2007 there existed only a few other places on the formula 1 calendar with a body of water close to the track . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the new tracks , such as valencia , singapore and abu dhabi are close to a body of water . [SEP]
[CLS] the course is considered to be quite fast and relatively easy to drive , drivers having commented that the consistent placement of corners allows them to easily learn the circuit and achieve competitive times . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the flat terrain around the lake , coupled with a track design that features few true straight ##s , means that the track is not con ##du ##ci ##ve to over ##taking or easy spec ##tat ##ing unless in possession of a grand ##stand seat . [SEP]
[CLS] land around the circuit ( including a large aquatic centre , a golf course , a lakeside stadium , some restaurants and rowing boat ##houses ) has restricted access during that entire period . [SEP]
[CLS] middle park , the home of south melbourne fc was demolished in 1994 due to expansion at albert park . [SEP]
[CLS] the grand prix will continue until at least 2020 after securing a new contract with formula one management . [SEP]
[CLS] during the nine months of the year when the track is not required for grand prix preparation or the race weekend , most of the track can be driven by ordinary street - registered vehicles either clockwise or anti - clockwise . [SEP]
[CLS] the only set of lights on the actual track is halfway between turns 12 and 13 , where drivers using queens road are cater ##ed for . [SEP]
[CLS] the chi ##can ##es at turns 11 and 12 are considerably more open than that used in the grand prix , using the escape roads . [SEP]
[CLS] the speed limit is generally 40 km / h , while some short sections have a speed limit of 50 km / h , which is still slower than an f1 car under pit lane speed restrictions . [SEP]
[CLS] black swans live and breed in albert park , and frequently cross the road causing traffic delays , sometimes with up to five cy ##gne ##ts ( young swans ) . [SEP]
[CLS] approximately 80 % of the track edge is lined with short park ##land - style chain - linked fencing leaving normal drivers less room for error than f1 drivers have during race weekend . [SEP]
[CLS] there is however substantial shoulder room between the outside of each lane and the fencing , which is used as parking along aug ##ht ##ie drive during the other nine months . [SEP]
[CLS] albert park has the distinction of being the only venue to host the australian grand prix in both world championship and non - world championship formats with an earlier configuration of the current circuit used for the race on two occasions during the 1950s . [SEP]
