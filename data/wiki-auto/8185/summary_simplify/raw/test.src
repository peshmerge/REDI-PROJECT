Dejima was built in 1634 to house Portuguese traders and separate them from Japanese society by digging a canal through a small peninsula.
The Dutch were moved to Dejima in 1641 and during most of the Edo period the island was the single place of direct trade and exchange between Japan and the outside world.
Dejima was abolished after the Treaty of Kanagawa in 1854 and the island was later integrated into Nagasaki city through land reclamation.
In 1543, the history of direct contacts between Japan and Europe began with the arrival of storm-blown Portuguese merchants on Tanegashima.
Six years later the Jesuit missionary Francis Xavier landed in Kagoshima.
In 1570 "daimyō" Ōmura Sumitada converted to Catholicism (choosing Bartolomeu as his Christian name) and made a deal with the Portuguese to develop Nagasaki; soon the port was open for trade.
In 1580 Sumitada gave the jurisdiction of Nagasaki to the Jesuits, and the Portuguese obtained the "de facto" monopoly on the silk trade with China through Macau.
The "shōgun" Iemitsu ordered the construction of the artificial island in 1634, to accommodate the Portuguese traders living in Nagasaki and prevent the propagation of their religion.
This was one of the many edicts put forth by Iemitsu between 1633 and 1639 moderating contact between Japan and other countries.
However, in response to the uprising of the predominantly Christian population in the Shimabara-Amakusa region, the Tokugawa government decided to expel the Portuguese in 1639.
Christian-era year dates were used on the stonework of the new warehouses and these were used in 1640 as a pretext to demolish the buildings and relocate the trading post to Nagasaki.
With the expulsion of the last Portuguese in 1639, Dejima became a failed commercial post and without the annual trading with Portuguese ships from Macau, the economy of Nagasaki suffered greatly.
The Dutch were forced by government officials to move from Hirado to Dejima in Nagasaki.
From 1641 on, only Chinese and Dutch ships were allowed to come to Japan, and Nagasaki harbor was the only harbor they were allowed to enter.
On the administrative level, the island of Dejima was part of the city of Nagasaki.
The 25 local Japanese families who owned the land received an annual rent from the Dutch.
The Dutch were watched by a number of Japanese officials, gatekeepers, night watchmen, and a supervisor ("otona" 乙名) with about fifty subordinates.
The Dutch were not allowed to hold any religious services on the island.
Despite the financial burden of maintaining the isolated outpost on Dejima, the trade with Japan was very profitable for the Dutch, initially yielding profits of 50% or more.
Trade declined in the 18th century, as only two ships per year were allowed to dock at Dejima.
After the bankruptcy of the East-India Company in 1795, the Dutch government took over the exchange with Japan.
This descriptive title did not change when the island's trading fell under Dutch state authority.
Throughout these years, the plan was to have one incumbent per year with some flexibility.
Also, deer pelts and shark skin were transported to Japan from Taiwan, as well as books, scientific instruments and many other rarities from Europe.
To this was added the personal trade of VOC employees on Dejima, which was an important source of income for them and their Japanese counterparts.
They sold more than 10,000 foreign books on various scientific subjects to the Japanese from the end of the 18th to the early 19th century.
These became the basis of knowledge and a factor in the "Rangaku" movement or Dutch studies.
For two hundred years, foreign merchants were generally not allowed to cross from Dejima to Nagasaki.
These "yūjo" were handpicked from 1642 by the Japanese, often against their will.
From the 18th century, there were some exceptions to this rule, especially following Tokugawa Yoshimune's doctrine of promoting European practical sciences.
A few "Oranda-yuki" ("those who stay with the Dutch") were allowed to stay for longer periods, but they had to report regularly to the Japanese guard post.
Sometimes physicians such as Engelbert Kaempfer, Carl Peter Thunberg, and Philipp Franz von Siebold were called to high-ranking Japanese patients with the permission of the authorities.
Starting in the 18th century, Dejima became known throughout Japan as a center of medicine, military science, and astronomy.
In addition, the "Opperhoofd" was treated like the representative of a tributary state, which meant that he had to pay a visit of homage to the "shōgun" in Edo.
Government officials told them in advance and in detail which (expensive) gifts were expected at the court, such as astrolabes, a pair of glasses, telescopes, globes, medical instruments, medical books, or exotic animals and tropical birds.
On arrival in Edo, the "Opperhoofd" and his retinue (usually his scribe and the factory physician) had to wait in the "Nagasakiya" , their mandatory residence, until they were summoned at the court.
During the reign of the somewhat eccentric "shōgun" Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, they were expected to perform Dutch dances and songs for the amusement of the "shōgun" after their official audience, according to Engelbert Kaempfer.
But they also used the opportunity of their stay of about two to three weeks in the capital to exchange knowledge with learned Japanese and, under escort, to visit the town.
Following the forced opening of Japan by US Navy Commodore Perry in 1854, the Bakufu suddenly increased its interactions with Dejima in an effort to build up knowledge of Western shipping methods.
The center was equipped with Japan's first steamship, the "Kankō Maru", given by the government of the Netherlands the same year.
The future Admiral Enomoto Takeaki was one of the students of the Training Center.
The original footprint of Dejima Island has been marked by rivets; but as restoration progresses, the ambit of the island will be easier to see at a glance.
The island was designated a national historic site in 1922, but further steps were slow to follow.
To better display Dejima's fan-shaped form, the project anticipated rebuilding only parts of the surrounding embankment wall that had once enclosed the island.
Buildings that remained from the Meiji period were to be used.
In 2000, five buildings including the Deputy Factor's Quarters were completed and opened to the public.
In the spring of 2006, the finishing touches were put on the Chief Factor's Residence, the Japanese Officials' Office, the Head Clerk's Quarters, the No.
The bridge was officially opened in attendance of members of the Japanese and Dutch royal families.
In its historical usage, the word is a gubernatorial title, comparable to the English Chief factor, for the chief executive officer of a Dutch "factory" in the sense of trading post, as led by a Factor, i.e.
