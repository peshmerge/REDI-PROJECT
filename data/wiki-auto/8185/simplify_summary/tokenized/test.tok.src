[CLS] de ##jima ( japanese : 出 島 , " exit island " ) was a dutch trading post located in nagasaki , japan from 1641 to 1854 . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##jima was a small fan - shaped artificial island in the bay of nagasaki covering an area of 120 × or 900 ##0 m2 , and is listed in old western documents latin ##ised as " des ##hima " , " dec ##ima " , " des ##jima " , " de ##zi ##ma " , " di ##sma " , or " di ##si ##ma " . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##jima was built in 1634 to house portuguese traders and separate them from japanese society by digging a canal through a small peninsula . [SEP]
[CLS] the dutch were moved to de ##jima in 1641 and during most of the edo period the island was the single place of direct trade and exchange between japan and the outside world . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##jima was abolished after the treaty of kan ##agawa in 1854 and the island was later integrated into nagasaki city through land reclamation . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1922 , the " de ##jima dutch trading post " was designated a japanese national historic site . [SEP]
[CLS] in 154 ##3 , the history of direct contacts between japan and europe began with the arrival of storm - blown portuguese merchants on tan ##ega ##shima . [SEP]
[CLS] six years later the jesuit missionary francis xavier landed in ka ##gos ##hima . [SEP]
[CLS] at first portuguese traders were based in hi ##rad ##o , but they moved in search of a better port . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1570 " dai ##my ##o " om ##ura sum ##ita ##da converted to catholicism ( choosing bart ##olo ##me ##u as his christian name ) and made a deal with the portuguese to develop nagasaki ; soon the port was open for trade . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1580 sum ##ita ##da gave the jurisdiction of nagasaki to the jesuits , and the portuguese obtained the " de facto " monopoly on the silk trade with china through macau . [SEP]
[CLS] the " sho ##gun " ie ##mit ##su ordered the construction of the artificial island in 1634 , to accommodate the portuguese traders living in nagasaki and prevent the propagation of their religion . [SEP]
[CLS] this was one of the many edict ##s put forth by ie ##mit ##su between 163 ##3 and 163 ##9 mode ##rating contact between japan and other countries . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in response to the uprising of the predominantly christian population in the shi ##ma ##bara - ama ##kus ##a region , the tokugawa government decided to ex ##pel the portuguese in 163 ##9 . [SEP]
[CLS] since 1609 , the dutch east india company had run a trading post on the island of hi ##rad ##o . [SEP]
[CLS] the departure of the portuguese left the dutch employees of the " ve ##reen ##ig ##de o ##ost ##ind ##ische com ##pa ##gni ##e " ( " vo ##c " ) as the sole western ##ers with trade access to japan . [SEP]
[CLS] for 33 years they were allowed to trade relatively freely . [SEP]
[CLS] at its maximum the hi ##rad ##o trading post covered a large area . [SEP]
[CLS] in 163 ##7 and 163 ##9 stone warehouses were constructed within the am ##bit of this hi ##rad ##o trading post . [SEP]
[CLS] christian - era year dates were used on the stone ##work of the new warehouses and these were used in 1640 as a pre ##text to demo ##lish the buildings and relocate the trading post to nagasaki . [SEP]
[CLS] with the expulsion of the last portuguese in 163 ##9 , de ##jima became a failed commercial post and without the annual trading with portuguese ships from macau , the economy of nagasaki suffered greatly . [SEP]
[CLS] the dutch were forced by government officials to move from hi ##rad ##o to de ##jima in nagasaki . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1641 on , only chinese and dutch ships were allowed to come to japan , and nagasaki harbor was the only harbor they were allowed to enter . [SEP]
[CLS] on the administrative level , the island of de ##jima was part of the city of nagasaki . [SEP]
[CLS] the 25 local japanese families who owned the land received an annual rent from the dutch . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##jima was a small island , 120 m by 75 m , linked to the mainland by a small bridge , guarded on both sides , and with a gate on the dutch side . [SEP]
[CLS] it contained houses for about twenty dutch ##men , warehouses , and accommodation for japanese officials . [SEP]
[CLS] the dutch were watched by a number of japanese officials , gate ##keepers , night watch ##men , and a supervisor ( " ot ##ona " [UNK] 名 ) with about fifty subordinate ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] numerous merchants supplied goods and catering , and about 150 interpreter ##s ( " ts ##uj ##i " [UNK] [UNK] ) served . [SEP]
[CLS] they all had to be paid by the " vo ##c " . [SEP]
[CLS] as the city of nagasaki , de ##jima was under the direct supervision of edo through a governor ( " nagasaki bug ##yo " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] every ship that arrived in de ##jima was inspected . [SEP]
[CLS] its sails were held by the japanese until they released the ship to leave . [SEP]
[CLS] they confiscated religious books and weapons . [SEP]
[CLS] the dutch were not allowed to hold any religious services on the island . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the financial burden of maintaining the isolated outpost on de ##jima , the trade with japan was very profitable for the dutch , initially yielding profits of 50 % or more . [SEP]
[CLS] trade declined in the 18th century , as only two ships per year were allowed to dock at de ##jima . [SEP]
[CLS] after the bankruptcy of the east - india company in 1795 , the dutch government took over the exchange with japan . [SEP]
[CLS] times were especially hard when the netherlands ( then called the batavia ##n republic ) was under french napoleonic rule . [SEP]
[CLS] all ties with the homeland were severed at de ##jima , and for a while , it was the only place in the world where the dutch flag was flown . [SEP]
[CLS] the chief dutch official in japan was called the " op ##per ##ho ##of ##d " by the dutch , or " ka ##pit ##an " ( from portuguese " capita ##o " ) by the japanese . [SEP]
[CLS] this descriptive title did not change when the island ' s trading fell under dutch state authority . [SEP]
[CLS] throughout these years , the plan was to have one incumbent per year with some flexibility . [SEP]
[CLS] originally , the dutch mainly traded in silk , cotton , and " mater ##ia med ##ica " from china and india , but sugar became more important later . [SEP]
[CLS] also , deer pe ##lts and shark skin were transported to japan from taiwan , as well as books , scientific instruments and many other ra ##rit ##ies from europe . [SEP]
[CLS] in return , the dutch traders bought japanese copper , silver , camp ##hor , porcelain , lac ##que ##r ware , and rice . [SEP]
[CLS] to this was added the personal trade of vo ##c employees on de ##jima , which was an important source of income for them and their japanese counterparts . [SEP]
[CLS] they sold more than 10 , 000 foreign books on various scientific subjects to the japanese from the end of the 18th to the early 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] these became the basis of knowledge and a factor in the " rang ##ak ##u " movement or dutch studies . [SEP]
[CLS] in all , 60 ##6 dutch ships arrived at de ##jima during its two centuries of settlement , from 1641 to 1847 . [SEP]
[CLS] for two hundred years , foreign merchants were generally not allowed to cross from de ##jima to nagasaki . [SEP]
[CLS] the japanese were likewise banned from entering de ##jima , except interpreter ##s , cooks , carpenter ##s , clerks and ' women of pleasure ' from the maru ##yama tea ##houses . [SEP]
[CLS] these " yu ##jo " were hand ##pic ##ked from 1642 by the japanese , often against their will . [SEP]
[CLS] from the 18th century , there were some exceptions to this rule , especially following tokugawa yo ##shi ##mun ##e ' s doctrine of promoting european practical sciences . [SEP]
[CLS] a few " or ##anda - yuki " ( " those who stay with the dutch " ) were allowed to stay for longer periods , but they had to report regularly to the japanese guard post . [SEP]
[CLS] once a year the europeans were allowed to attend the festivities at the su ##wa - shrine under escort . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes physicians such as eng ##el ##bert ka ##em ##pf ##er , carl peter th ##un ##berg , and philipp franz von si ##eb ##old were called to high - ranking japanese patients with the permission of the authorities . [SEP]
[CLS] starting in the 18th century , de ##jima became known throughout japan as a center of medicine , military science , and astronomy . [SEP]
[CLS] many samurai traveled there for " dutch studies " ( rang ##ak ##u ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , the " op ##per ##ho ##of ##d " was treated like the representative of a tributary state , which meant that he had to pay a visit of homage to the " sho ##gun " in edo . [SEP]
[CLS] the dutch delegation traveled to edo yearly between 1660 and 1790 , and once every four years thereafter . [SEP]
[CLS] this pre ##ro ##gative was denied to the chinese traders . [SEP]
[CLS] the lengthy travel to the sho ##gun ##al court broke the boredom of the dutch stay , but it was a costly affair . [SEP]
[CLS] government officials told them in advance and in detail which ( expensive ) gifts were expected at the court , such as astro ##lab ##es , a pair of glasses , telescopes , globe ##s , medical instruments , medical books , or exotic animals and tropical birds . [SEP]
[CLS] in return , the dutch delegation received some gifts from the " sho ##gun " . [SEP]
[CLS] on arrival in edo , the " op ##per ##ho ##of ##d " and his re ##tin ##ue ( usually his scribe and the factory physician ) had to wait in the " nagasaki ##ya " , their mandatory residence , until they were summoned at the court . [SEP]
[CLS] during the reign of the somewhat eccentric " sho ##gun " tokugawa ts ##una ##yoshi , they were expected to perform dutch dances and songs for the amusement of the " sho ##gun " after their official audience , according to eng ##el ##bert ka ##em ##pf ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] but they also used the opportunity of their stay of about two to three weeks in the capital to exchange knowledge with learned japanese and , under escort , to visit the town . [SEP]
[CLS] following the forced opening of japan by us navy commodore perry in 1854 , the baku ##fu suddenly increased its interactions with de ##jima in an effort to build up knowledge of western shipping methods . [SEP]
[CLS] the nagasaki naval training center ( 長 崎 海 軍 [UNK] [UNK] [UNK] , nagasaki kai ##gun den ##shu ##sho ) , a naval training institute , was established in 1855 by the government of the " sho ##gun " at the entrance of de ##jima , to enable maximum interaction with dutch naval know - how . [SEP]
[CLS] the center was equipped with japan ' s first steamship , the " kan ##ko maru " , given by the government of the netherlands the same year . [SEP]
[CLS] the future admiral en ##omo ##to take ##aki was one of the students of the training center . [SEP]
[CLS] the dutch east india company ' s trading post at de ##jima was abolished when japan concluded the treaty of kan ##agawa with the usa in 1858 . [SEP]
[CLS] this ended de ##jima ' s role as japan ' s only window on the western world during the era of national isolation . [SEP]
[CLS] since then , the island was expanded by reclaimed land and merged into nagasaki . [SEP]
[CLS] extensive redesign ##ing of nagasaki harbor in 1904 obscured its original location . [SEP]
[CLS] the original footprint of de ##jima island has been marked by ri ##vet ##s ; but as restoration progresses , the am ##bit of the island will be easier to see at a glance . [SEP]
[CLS] de ##jima today is a work in progress . [SEP]
[CLS] the island was designated a national historic site in 1922 , but further steps were slow to follow . [SEP]
[CLS] restoration work was started in 1953 , but that project lang ##uis ##hed . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1996 , restoration of de ##jima began with plans for rec ##ons ##tructing 25 buildings in their early 19th - century state . [SEP]
[CLS] to better display de ##jima ' s fan - shaped form , the project anticipated rebuilding only parts of the surrounding embankment wall that had once enclosed the island . [SEP]
[CLS] buildings that remained from the meiji period were to be used . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2000 , five buildings including the deputy factor ' s quarters were completed and opened to the public . [SEP]
[CLS] in the spring of 2006 , the finishing touches were put on the chief factor ' s residence , the japanese officials ' office , the head clerk ' s quarters , the no . 3 warehouse , and the sea gate . [SEP]
[CLS] currently , some 10 buildings throughout the area have been restored . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2017 , six new buildings , as well as the ' om ##ote ##mon - bash ##i bridge ' ( the old bridge to the mainland ) , were restored . [SEP]
[CLS] the bridge was officially opened in attendance of members of the japanese and dutch royal families . [SEP]
[CLS] the long - term planning intends that de ##jima will be surrounded by water on all four sides ; its characteristic fan - shaped form and all of its embankment walls will be fully restored . [SEP]
[CLS] this long - term plan will include large - scale urban redevelopment in the area . [SEP]
[CLS] to make de ##jima an island again will require re ##rou ##ting the nak ##ashi ##ma river and moving a part of route 49 ##9 . [SEP]
[CLS] " op ##per ##ho ##of ##d " is a dutch word ( plural " op ##per ##ho ##of ##den " ) which literally means ' supreme head ##man ' . [SEP]
[CLS] the japanese used to call the trading post chiefs " ka ##pit ##an " which is derived from portuguese " capita ##o " ( cf . latin " cap ##ut " , head ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in its historical usage , the word is a gubernatorial title , comparable to the english chief factor , for the chief executive officer of a dutch " factory " in the sense of trading post , as led by a factor , i . e . agent . [SEP]
