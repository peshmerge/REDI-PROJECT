[CLS] half - life ( symbol " t " ) is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half of its initial value . [SEP]
[CLS] the term is commonly used in nuclear physics to describe how quickly unstable atoms undergo , or how long stable atoms survive , radioactive decay . [SEP]
[CLS] the term is also used more generally to character ##ize any type of exponential or non - exponential decay . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the medical sciences refer to the biological half - life of drugs and other chemicals in the human body . [SEP]
[CLS] the converse of half - life is doubling time . [SEP]
[CLS] the original term , " half - life period " , dating to ernest rutherford ' s discovery of the principle in 1907 , was shortened to " half - life " in the early 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] rutherford applied the principle of a radioactive element ' s half - life to studies of age determination of rocks by measuring the decay period of ra ##dium to lead - 206 . [SEP]
[CLS] half - life is constant over the lifetime of an exponential ##ly decay ##ing quantity , and it is a characteristic unit for the exponential decay equation . [SEP]
[CLS] the accompanying table shows the reduction of a quantity as a function of the number of half - lives el ##ap ##sed . [SEP]
[CLS] a half - life usually describes the decay of discrete entities , such as radioactive atoms . [SEP]
[CLS] in that case , it does not work to use the definition that states " half - life is the time required for exactly half of the entities to decay " . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , if there is just one radioactive atom , and its half - life is one second , there will " not " be " half of an atom " left after one second . [SEP]
[CLS] instead , the half - life is defined in terms of probability : " half - life is the time required for exactly half of the entities to decay " on average " " . [SEP]
[CLS] in other words , the " probability " of a radioactive atom decay ##ing within its half - life is 50 % . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the image on the right is a simulation of many identical atoms undergoing radioactive decay . [SEP]
[CLS] note that after one half - life there are not " exactly " one - half of the atoms remaining , only " approximately " , because of the random variation in the process . [SEP]
[CLS] nevertheless , when there are many identical atoms decay ##ing ( right boxes ) , the law of large numbers suggests that it is a " very good approximation " to say that half of the atoms remain after one half - life . [SEP]
[CLS] there are various simple exercises that demonstrate pro ##ba ##bilis ##tic decay , for example involving flipping coins or running a statistical computer program . [SEP]
[CLS] an exponential decay can be described by any of the following three equivalent formulas : where [SEP]
[CLS] the three parameters " t " , τ , and λ are all directly related in the following way : where l ##n ( 2 ) is the natural log ##ari ##th ##m of 2 ( approximately 0 . 69 ##3 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some quantities decay by two exponential - decay processes simultaneously . [SEP]
[CLS] for three or more processes , the analogous formula is : for a proof of these formulas , see exponential decay § decay by two or more processes . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a half - life describing any exponential - decay process . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " half - life " is almost exclusively used for decay processes that are exponential ( such as radioactive decay or the other examples above ) , or approximately exponential ( such as biological half - life discussed below ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in a decay process that is not even close to exponential , the half - life will change dramatically while the decay is happening . [SEP]
[CLS] in this situation it is generally uncommon to talk about half - life in the first place , but sometimes people will describe the decay in terms of its " first half - life " , " second half - life " , etc . , where the first half - life is defined as the time required for decay from the initial value to 50 % , the second half - life is from 50 % to 25 % , and so on . [SEP]
[CLS] a biological half - life or elimination half - life is the time it takes for a substance ( drug , radioactive nu ##cl ##ide , or other ) to lose one - half of its ph ##arm ##aco ##logic , ph ##ys ##iol ##og ##ic , or radio ##logical activity . [SEP]
[CLS] in a medical context , the half - life may also describe the time that it takes for the concentration of a substance in blood plasma to reach one - half of its steady - state value ( the " plasma half - life " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the relationship between the biological and plasma half - lives of a substance can be complex , due to factors including accumulation in tissues , active meta ##bol ##ites , and receptor interactions . [SEP]
[CLS] while a radioactive isotope decay ##s almost perfectly according to so - called " first order kinetic ##s " where the rate constant is a fixed number , the elimination of a substance from a living organism usually follows more complex chemical kinetic ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the biological half - life of water in a human being is about 9 to 10 days , though this can be altered by behavior and various other conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] the biological half - life of ca ##es ##ium in human beings is between one and four months . [SEP]
[CLS] the concept of a half - life has also been utilized for pest ##icides in plants , and certain authors maintain that pest ##icide risk and impact assessment models rely on and are sensitive to information describing di ##ssi ##pati ##on from plants . [SEP]
