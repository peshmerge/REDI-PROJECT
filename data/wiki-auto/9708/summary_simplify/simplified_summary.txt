the european charter for regional or minority languages is a european treaty signed in 1992 .
the planning for the charter was undertaken by the predecessor to the current congress of local and regional authorities , the standing conference of local and regional authorities of europe because the involvement of local and regional government was essential .
it only applies to languages traditionally used by the nationals of the state parties , but not all languages used by recent immigrants from other states .
some states , such as ukraine and sweden , have tied the status of minority language to the national minorities .
languages that are official within regions , provinces or federal units within a stateline are not official languages of the state .
the united kingdom has ratified the charter in respect to welsh in wales , scotland , and northern ireland .
france , although a signatory , has been blocked from ratifying the charter in respect to the languages of france .
the charter provides a large number of different actions state parties can take to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages .
signatories may also say that a qualifying language or languages will benefit from the higher level of protection .
countries can treat languages differently under the charter , for example , in the united kingdom , the welsh language is ratified under the general part ii principles .
part ii of the charter is about eight main principles and goals on which states must base their policies and legislation .
