[CLS] the european charter for regional or minority languages ( ec ##rm ##l ) is a european treaty ( ce ##ts 148 ) adopted in 1992 under the auspices of the council of europe to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages in europe . [SEP]
[CLS] the preparation for the charter was undertaken by the predecessor to the current congress of local and regional authorities , the standing conference of local and regional authorities of europe because involvement of local and regional government was essential . [SEP]
[CLS] the actual charter was written in the parliamentary assembly based on the congress ' recommendations . [SEP]
[CLS] it only applies to languages traditionally used by the nationals of the state parties ( thus excluding languages used by recent immigrants from other states , see immigrant languages ) , which significantly differ from the majority or official language ( thus excluding what the state party wishes to consider as mere local dialects of the official or majority language ) and that either have a territorial basis ( and are therefore traditionally spoken by populations of regions or areas within the state ) or are used by linguistic minorities within the state as a whole ( thereby including such languages as yiddish , romani and le ##m ##ko , which are used over a wide geographic area ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some states , such as ukraine and sweden , have tied the status of minority language to the recognized national minorities , which are defined by ethnic , cultural and / or religious criteria , thereby ci ##rc ##um ##venting the charter ' s notion of linguistic minority . [SEP]
[CLS] languages that are official within regions , provinces or federal units within a state ( for example catalan in spain ) are not classified as official languages of the state and may therefore benefit from the charter . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , ireland has not been able to sign the charter on behalf of the irish language ( although a minority language ) as it is defined as the first official language of the state . [SEP]
[CLS] the united kingdom has ratified the charter in respect to ( among other languages ) welsh in wales , scots in scotland , and irish in northern ireland . [SEP]
[CLS] france , although a sign ##atory , has been constitutional ##ly blocked from rat ##ifying the charter in respect to the languages of france . [SEP]
[CLS] the charter provides a large number of different actions state parties can take to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages . [SEP]
[CLS] there are two levels of protection — all sign ##ator ##ies must apply the lower level of protection to qualifying languages . [SEP]
[CLS] sign ##ator ##ies may further declare that a qualifying language or languages will benefit from the higher level of protection , which lists a range of actions from which states must agree to undertake at least 35 . [SEP]
[CLS] countries can rat ##ify the charter in respect of its minority languages based on part ii or part iii of the charter , which contain varying principles . [SEP]
[CLS] countries can treat languages differently under the charter , for example , in the united kingdom , the welsh language is ratified under the general part ii principles as well as the more specific part iii commitments , while the cornish language is ratified only under part ii . [SEP]
[CLS] part ii of the charter details eight main principles and objectives upon which states must base their policies and legislation . [SEP]
[CLS] they are seen as a framework for the preservation of the languages concerned . [SEP]
[CLS] part iii details comprehensive rules , across a number of sectors , by which states agree to ab ##ide . [SEP]
[CLS] each language to which part iii of the charter is applied must be named specifically by the government . [SEP]
[CLS] states must select at least thirty - five of the undertaking ##s in respect to each language . [SEP]
[CLS] many provisions contain several options , of varying degrees of string ##ency , one of which has to be chosen “ according to the situation of each language ” . [SEP]
