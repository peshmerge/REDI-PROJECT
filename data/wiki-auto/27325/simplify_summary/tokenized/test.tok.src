[CLS] transport within singapore is mainly land - based . [SEP]
[CLS] many parts of singapore , including islands such as sent ##osa and ju ##rong island are accessible by road . [SEP]
[CLS] the other major form of transportation within singapore is rail : the mass rapid transit which runs the length and width of singapore , and the light rail transit which runs within a few neighbourhoods . [SEP]
[CLS] the main island of singapore is connected to the other islands by ferry ##boat services . [SEP]
[CLS] there are two bridges which link singapore to malaysia – the causeway , and the second link . [SEP]

[CLS] mc ##kins ##ey ’ s urban transportation report rank singapore ' s transport system world ' s best overall based on five criteria - availability , afford ##ability , efficiency , convenience , sustainability . [SEP]
[CLS] singapore has one of the most cost - efficient public transport networks in the world , according to a study by london consulting firm cr ##edo . [SEP]
[CLS] public transport covers a variety of transport modes such as bus , rail , and taxi . [SEP]
[CLS] the public transport system is regulated by the land transport authority , which oversees the three main modes of public transportation . [SEP]
[CLS] fare regulation and bus service standards are under the pu ##r ##view of an independent body , the public transport council , while transit ##link , established by sbs transit , sm ##rt trains and sm ##rt buses , helps to create a system with a common fare - payment mode , information platform , and a physical network without du ##plication of services . [SEP]
[CLS] the policies of the land transport authority are meant to encourage the use of public transport in singapore . [SEP]
[CLS] the key aims are to provide an incentive to reside away from the central district , as well as to reduce air pollution . [SEP]
[CLS] singapore has a mass rapid transit ( mr ##t ) and light rail transit ( l ##rt ) rail system consisting of five lines . [SEP]
[CLS] there is also a system of bus routes throughout the island , all of which have air conditioning units installed due to singapore ' s tropical climate . [SEP]
[CLS] besides cash , a contact ##less smart card called the e ##z - link card can be used to pay bus and mr ##t fares . [SEP]
[CLS] the average amount of time people spend com ##mut ##ing with public transit in singapore , for example to and from work , on a weekday is 84 min . [SEP]
[CLS] 25 % of public transit riders , ride for more than 2 hours every day . [SEP]
[CLS] the average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 12 min , while 11 % of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day . [SEP]

[CLS] launched in december 2007 by land transport authority , singapore tourism board and e ##z - link , the singapore tourist pass offers unlimited travel for tourists to singapore on singapore ' s public transport system . [SEP]
[CLS] for s $ 10 a day ( s $ 20 for 3 days , as of april 2017 ) and with s $ 10 deposit , tourists can take any number of rides on buses and trains operated by sbs transit buses , tower transit singapore , go ahead singapore , sm ##rt buses , sbs transit trains and sm ##rt trains . [SEP]
[CLS] certain buses like night rider , train service like sent ##osa express are not applicable . [SEP]
[CLS] the singapore tourist pass is available at selected mr ##t stations . [SEP]
[CLS] singapore ' s public transport system had been re ##lian ##t largely on buses , until the opening of the first section of the mass rapid transit in 1987 . [SEP]
[CLS] although buses still enjoy an average daily riders ##hip exceeding the number carried on both the mr ##t and l ##rt systems ( 3 . 9 million on buses , compared to 3 . 1 million on the mr ##t and l ##rt in the year 2016 ) , the land transport authority plans to expand the rail system such that buses will eventually play only a feeder role to an extensive rail network . [SEP]
[CLS] the mr ##t network consists of five main lines , for a total network length of 198 . 6 km and with 119 stations . [SEP]
[CLS] the north south line , east west line and circle line are operated by sm ##rt trains ( sm ##rt corporation ) , while the north east line and downtown line since 22 december 2013 , are run by sbs transit . [SEP]
[CLS] the circle line extension from promenade to marina bay began operation since 14 january 2012 . [SEP]
[CLS] light rail transit functioning as feeder ##s to the main mr ##t network has been under study for some time , particularly since the existing urban configuration of self - containing new towns spread out in the suburbs meant it was feasible to consider having light rail systems connecting each town to the mr ##t station in the town centre , a role which has traditionally been provided by feeder buses . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , the first sm ##rt light rail ( sm ##rt corporation ) operated l ##rt was opened in bukit pan ##jan ##g in 1999 to provide a connection to cho ##a chu kang in neighbouring cho ##a chu kang new town . [SEP]
[CLS] although subsequently hit by over 50 incidents , some of which resulted in several days of system suspension , similar systems albeit from a different company were introduced in sen ##g ##kan ##g and pun ##gg ##ol in 2003 and 2005 respectively , both operated by sbs transit . [SEP]
[CLS] singapore has had other forms of light urban rail systems , such as the mono ##rail system on sent ##osa island , which opened in february 1982 . [SEP]
[CLS] this 6 . 4 km , 6 - station system was closed in march 2005 and a new sent ##osa express system was built by december 2006 . [SEP]
[CLS] the chang ##i sky ##train , a people move ##r system shut ##tling passengers between the three terminals at the singapore chang ##i airport , was opened originally in 1990 along with terminal 2 and upgraded in 2006 with the completion of terminal 3 . [SEP]
[CLS] the ju ##rong bird ##park previously featured an air - conditioned pan ##ora ##il which closed in 2012 . [SEP]
[CLS] taxi ##ca ##bs are a popular form of public transport in the compact sovereign city - state of singapore , with fares considered low compared to those in most cities in developed countries . [SEP]
[CLS] starting rates were $ 3 . 20 - $ 3 . 90 . [SEP]
[CLS] as of march 2019 , the taxi population has been increased to 83 , 03 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] taxis may be flag ##ged down at any time of the day along any public road outside of the central business district ( cb ##d ) . [SEP]

[CLS] before world war ii , rick ##shaw ##s were an important part of urban public transportation . [SEP]
[CLS] rick ##shaw ##s were taken over by the tri ##shaw after the world war . [SEP]
[CLS] the tri ##shaw has been discontinued for usage as a means of transportation after 1980 . [SEP]
[CLS] however , there are some tri ##shaw ##s left which now serve as tourist attractions , taking tourists for a ride around the downtown district . [SEP]
