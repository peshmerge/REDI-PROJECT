[CLS] the public transport system is regulated by the land transport authority , which oversees the three main modes of public transportation . [SEP]
[CLS] fare regulation and bus service standards are under the pu ##r ##view of an independent body , the public transport council , while transit ##link , established by sbs transit , sm ##rt trains and sm ##rt buses , helps to create a system with a common fare - payment mode , information platform , and a physical network without du ##plication of services . [SEP]
[CLS] the policies of the land transport authority are meant to encourage the use of public transport in singapore . [SEP]
[CLS] the key aims are to provide an incentive to reside away from the central district , as well as to reduce air pollution . [SEP]
[CLS] there is also a system of bus routes throughout the island , all of which have air conditioning units installed due to singapore ' s tropical climate . [SEP]
[CLS] the average amount of time people spend com ##mut ##ing with public transit in singapore , for example to and from work , on a weekday is 84 min . [SEP]

[CLS] singapore ' s public transport system had been re ##lian ##t largely on buses , until the opening of the first section of the mass rapid transit in 1987 . [SEP]
[CLS] although buses still enjoy an average daily riders ##hip exceeding the number carried on both the mr ##t and l ##rt systems ( 3 . 9 million on buses , compared to 3 . 1 million on the mr ##t and l ##rt in the year 2016 ) , the land transport authority plans to expand the rail system such that buses will eventually play only a feeder role to an extensive rail network . [SEP]
[CLS] the north south line , east west line and circle line are operated by sm ##rt trains ( sm ##rt corporation ) , while the north east line and downtown line since 22 december 2013 , are run by sbs transit . [SEP]
[CLS] the circle line extension from promenade to marina bay began operation since 14 january 2012 . [SEP]
[CLS] light rail transit functioning as feeder ##s to the main mr ##t network has been under study for some time , particularly since the existing urban configuration of self - containing new towns spread out in the suburbs meant it was feasible to consider having light rail systems connecting each town to the mr ##t station in the town centre , a role which has traditionally been provided by feeder buses . [SEP]
[CLS] although subsequently hit by over 50 incidents , some of which resulted in several days of system suspension , similar systems albeit from a different company were introduced in sen ##g ##kan ##g and pun ##gg ##ol in 2003 and 2005 respectively , both operated by sbs transit . [SEP]
