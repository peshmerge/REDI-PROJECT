[CLS] they can range from simple dwellings such as ru ##diment ##ary huts of nomadic tribes and the improvised shack ##s in shan ##ty ##town ##s to complex , fixed structures of wood , brick , concrete or other materials containing plumbing , ventilation , and electrical systems . [SEP]
[CLS] houses use a range of different roof ##ing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space . [SEP]
[CLS] houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from bu ##rg ##lars or other tres ##pass ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] in traditional agriculture - oriented societies , domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock ( like cattle ) may share part of the house with humans . [SEP]
[CLS] some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar - sized group ; larger houses called town ##houses or row houses may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure . [SEP]
[CLS] a house may be accompanied by out ##building ##s , such as a garage for vehicles or a shed for gardening equipment and tools . [SEP]
[CLS] the english word " house " derives directly from the old english " hu ##s " meaning " dwelling , shelter , home , house , " which in turn derives from proto - germanic " hu ##san " ( reconstructed by et ##ym ##ological analysis ) which is of unknown origin . [SEP]
[CLS] feng shu ##i , originally a chinese method of moving houses according to such factors as rain and micro - climates , has recently expanded its scope to address the design of interior spaces , with a view to promoting harmon ##ious effects on the people living inside the house , although no actual effect has ever been demonstrated . [SEP]
[CLS] feng shu ##i can also mean the " aura " in or around a dwelling , making it comparable to the real - estate sales concept of " indoor - outdoor flow " . [SEP]
[CLS] the square footage of a house in the united states reports the area of " living space " , excluding the garage and other non - living spaces . [SEP]
[CLS] the " square metres " figure of a house in europe reports the area of the walls en ##cl ##osing the home , and thus includes any attached garage and non - living spaces . [SEP]
[CLS] these may include a living / eating area , a sleeping area , and ( if suitable facilities and services exist ) separate or combined washing and lava ##tory areas . [SEP]
[CLS] in traditional agriculture - oriented societies , domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock ( like cattle ) often share part of the house with human beings . [SEP]
[CLS] a typical " fours ##qua ##re house " ( as pictured ) occurred commonly in the early history of the us where they were mainly built , with a staircase in the center of the house , surrounded by four rooms , and connected to other sections of the home ( including in more recent eras a garage ) . [SEP]
[CLS] little is known about the earliest origin of the house and its interior , however it can be traced back to the simplest form of shelters . [SEP]
[CLS] roman architect vi ##tr ##u ##vius ' theories have claimed the first form of architecture as a frame of timber branches finished in mud , also known as the primitive hut . [SEP]
[CLS] their lifestyle ##s were largely communal , as areas such as the great hall enforced the custom of dining and meetings and the solar intended for shared sleeping beds . [SEP]
[CLS] unlike the qualities and uses of the manor houses , most rooms of the palazzo contained no purpose , yet were given several doors . [SEP]
[CLS] the layout allowed occupants to freely walk room to room from one door to another , thus breaking the boundaries of privacy . [SEP]
[CLS] an early example of the segregation of rooms and con ##se ##quent enhancement of privacy may be found in 159 ##7 at the beaufort house built in chelsea . [SEP]
[CLS] this new extension was revolutionary at the time , allowing the integration of one door per room , in which all universally connected to the same corridor . [SEP]
[CLS] english architect sir roger pratt states " the common way in the middle through the whole length of the house , avoids the offices from one mole ##sti ##ng the other by continual passing through them . " [SEP]
[CLS] this social divide between rich and poor favored the physical integration of the corridor into housing by the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] rooms were changed from public to private as single entry ##ways forced notions of entering a room with a specific purpose . [SEP]
[CLS] compared to the large scaled houses in england and the renaissance , the 17th century dutch house was smaller , and was only inhabited by up to four to five members . [SEP]
[CLS] this was due to their embracing " self - reliance " , in contrast to the dependence on servants , and a design for a lifestyle centered on the family . [SEP]
[CLS] house layout ##s also incorporated the idea of the corridor as well as the importance of function and privacy . [SEP]
[CLS] by the end of the 17th century , the house layout was soon transformed to become employment - free , enforcing these ideas for the future . [SEP]
[CLS] by the mid 20th century and the increase in high - tech equipment saw a marked shift whereby the contemporary doctor typically works from an office complex or hospital . [SEP]
[CLS] the introduction of technology and electronic systems within the house has questioned the impressions of privacy as well as the segregation of work from home . [SEP]
[CLS] work also , has been altered due to the increase of communications . [SEP]
[CLS] although com ##mut ##ing is reduced , " the desire to separate working and living remains apparent . " [SEP]
[CLS] in jonathan hill ' s book " immature architecture " , he identifies this new invasion of privacy as " electromagnetic weather " . [SEP]
[CLS] natural or man - made weather remains concurrent inside or outside the house , yet the electromagnetic weather is able to generate within both positions . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , modern house - construction techniques include light - frame construction ( in areas with access to supplies of wood ) and adobe or sometimes rammed - earth construction ( in arid regions with scarce wood - resources ) . [SEP]
[CLS] more generally , people often build houses out of the nearest available material , and often tradition or culture govern construction - materials , so whole towns , areas , counties or even states / countries may be built out of one main type of material . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , a large fraction of american houses use wood , while most british and many european houses use stone or brick or mud . [SEP]
[CLS] the original impetus was to use the labor force inside a shelter during inc ##lem ##ent weather . [SEP]
[CLS] more recently builders have begun to collaborate with structural engineers who use computers and finite element analysis to design pre ##fa ##bri ##cated steel - framed homes with known resistance to high wind - loads and seismic forces . [SEP]
[CLS] though not in wide use , these methods frequently appeal to home ##own ##ers who may become actively involved in the construction process . [SEP]
[CLS] one tool of earthquake engineering is base isolation which is increasingly used for earthquake protection . [SEP]
[CLS] base isolation is a collection of structural elements of a building that should substantially deco ##up ##le it from the shaking ground thus protecting the building ' s integrity and enhancing its seismic performance . [SEP]
[CLS] normally , excavations are made around the building and the building is separated from the foundations . [SEP]
[CLS] steel or reinforced concrete beams replace the connections to the foundations , while under these , the iso ##lating pads , or " base iso ##lat ##ors " , replace the material removed . [SEP]
[CLS] while the " base isolation " tends to restrict transmission of the ground motion to the building , it also keeps the building positioned properly over the foundation . [SEP]
[CLS] careful attention to detail is required where the building interfaces with the ground , especially at entrances , stairway ##s and ramps , to ensure sufficient relative motion of those structural elements . [SEP]
[CLS] bamboo is an earthquake - resistant material , and is very versatile because it comes from fast - grow plants . [SEP]
[CLS] in many parts of the world , houses are constructed using sc ##ave ##nged materials . [SEP]
[CLS] in manila ' s pay ##ata ##s neighborhood , sl ##um houses are often made of material sourced from a nearby garbage dump . [SEP]
[CLS] in da ##kar , it is not uncommon to see houses made of recycled materials standing atop a mixture of garbage and sand which serves as a foundation . [SEP]
[CLS] the garbage - sand mixture is also used to protect the house from flooding . [SEP]
[CLS] new houses in the uk are not covered by the sale of goods act . [SEP]
[CLS] when purchasing a new house the buyer has different legal protection than when buying other products . [SEP]
[CLS] a more systematic and general approach to identifying houses may use various methods of house numbering . [SEP]
[CLS] humans often build houses for domestic or wild animals , often resembling smaller versions of human dom ##ici ##les . [SEP]
[CLS] houses may express the circumstances or opinions of their builders or their inhabitants . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , a vast and elaborate house may serve as a sign of conspicuous wealth whereas a low - profile house built of recycled materials may indicate support of energy conservation . [SEP]
[CLS] houses of particular historical significance ( former residences of the famous , for example , or even just very old houses ) may gain a protected status in town planning as examples of built heritage or of streets ##cape . [SEP]
[CLS] contrast the importance of house - destruction , tent dwelling and house rebuilding in the wake of many natural disasters . [SEP]
