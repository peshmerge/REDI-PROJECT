[CLS] an all ##ele is a variant form of a given gene . [SEP]
[CLS] sometimes , different all ##eles can result in different ob ##ser ##vable ph ##eno ##typic traits , such as different pigment ##ation . [SEP]
[CLS] a notable example of this trait of color variation is gregor men ##del ' s discovery that the white and purple flower colors in pea plants were the result of " pure line " traits which could be used as a control for future experiments . [SEP]
[CLS] however , most genetic variations result in little or no ob ##ser ##vable ph ##eno ##typic variation . [SEP]
[CLS] most multi ##cellular organisms have two sets of chromosomes ; that is , they are dip ##loid . [SEP]
[CLS] in this case , the chromosomes can be paired : each pair is made up of two chromosomes of the same type , known as homo ##log ##ous chromosomes . [SEP]
[CLS] if both all ##eles at a gene ( or locus ) on the homo ##log ##ous chromosomes are the same , they and the organism are homo ##zy ##go ##us with respect to that gene ( or locus ) . [SEP]
[CLS] if the all ##eles are different , they and the organism are het ##ero ##zy ##go ##us with respect to that gene . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " all ##ele " is a short form of all ##elo ##mo ##rp ##h ( " other form " , a word coined by british genetic ##ists william bates ##on and edith rebecca saunders ) , which was used in the early days of genetics to describe variant forms of a gene detected as different ph ##eno ##type ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it derives from the greek prefix α ##λ ##λ ##η ##λ ##ο - , " all ##elo - " , meaning " mutual " , " reciprocal " , or " each other " , which itself is related to the greek adjective α ##λ ##λ ##ος , " all ##os " ( co ##gna ##te with latin " ali ##us " ) , meaning " other " . [SEP]
[CLS] in many cases , gen ##ot ##yp ##ic interactions between the two all ##eles at a locus can be described as dominant or recess ##ive , according to which of the two homo ##zy ##go ##us ph ##eno ##type ##s the het ##ero ##zy ##go ##te most resembles . [SEP]
[CLS] where the het ##ero ##zy ##go ##te is ind ##ist ##ing ##uis ##hab ##le from one of the homo ##zy ##go ##tes , the all ##ele expressed is the one that leads to the " dominant " ph ##eno ##type , and the other all ##ele is said to be " recess ##ive " . [SEP]
[CLS] the degree and pattern of dominance varies among lo ##ci . [SEP]
[CLS] this type of interaction was first formally described by gregor men ##del . [SEP]
[CLS] however , many traits def ##y this simple cat ##ego ##rization and the ph ##eno ##type ##s are modeled by co - dominance and poly ##genic inheritance . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " wild type " all ##ele is sometimes used to describe an all ##ele that is thought to contribute to the typical ph ##eno ##typic character as seen in " wild " populations of organisms , such as fruit flies ( " dr ##oso ##phila mel ##ano ##gas ##ter " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] such a " wild type " all ##ele was historically regarded as leading to a dominant ( over ##powering - always expressed ) , common , and normal ph ##eno ##type , in contrast to " mutant " all ##eles that lead to recess ##ive , rare , and frequently del ##eter ##ious ph ##eno ##type ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] it was formerly thought that most individuals were homo ##zy ##go ##us for the " wild type " all ##ele at most gene lo ##ci , and that any alternative " mutant " all ##ele was found in homo ##zy ##go ##us form in a small minority of " affected " individuals , often as genetic diseases , and more frequently in het ##ero ##zy ##go ##us form in " carriers " for the mutant all ##ele . [SEP]
[CLS] it is now appreciated that most or all gene lo ##ci are highly poly ##morphic , with multiple all ##eles , whose frequencies vary from population to population , and that a great deal of genetic variation is hidden in the form of all ##eles that do not produce obvious ph ##eno ##typic differences . [SEP]
[CLS] a population or species of organisms typically includes multiple all ##eles at each locus among various individuals . [SEP]
[CLS] all ##eli ##c variation at a locus is me ##asurable as the number of all ##eles ( poly ##morphism ) present , or the proportion of het ##ero ##zy ##go ##tes in the population . [SEP]
[CLS] a null all ##ele is a gene variant that lacks the gene ' s normal function because it either is not expressed , or the expressed protein is inactive . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , at the gene locus for the ab ##o blood type car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##te antigen ##s in humans , classical genetics recognizes three all ##eles , i , i , and i , which determine compatibility of blood trans ##fusion ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] any individual has one of six possible gen ##otype ##s ( ii , ii , ii , ii , ii , and ii ) which produce one of four possible ph ##eno ##type ##s : " type a " ( produced by ii homo ##zy ##go ##us and ii het ##ero ##zy ##go ##us gen ##otype ##s ) , " type b " ( produced by ii homo ##zy ##go ##us and ii het ##ero ##zy ##go ##us gen ##otype ##s ) , " type ab " produced by ii het ##ero ##zy ##go ##us gen ##otype , and " type o " produced by ii homo ##zy ##go ##us gen ##otype . [SEP]
[CLS] ( it is now known that each of the a , b , and o all ##eles is actually a class of multiple all ##eles with different dna sequences that produce proteins with identical properties : more than 70 all ##eles are known at the ab ##o locus . [SEP]
[CLS] hence an individual with " type a " blood may be an ao het ##ero ##zy ##go ##te , an aa homo ##zy ##go ##te , or an aa het ##ero ##zy ##go ##te with two different " a " all ##eles . ) [SEP]
[CLS] the frequency of all ##eles in a dip ##loid population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding gen ##otype ##s ( see hardy - wei ##nberg principle ) . [SEP]
[CLS] for a simple model , with two all ##eles ; [SEP]
[CLS] where " p " is the frequency of one all ##ele and " q " is the frequency of the alternative all ##ele , which necessarily sum to unity . [SEP]
[CLS] then , " p " is the fraction of the population homo ##zy ##go ##us for the first all ##ele , 2 " p ##q " is the fraction of het ##ero ##zy ##go ##tes , and " q " is the fraction homo ##zy ##go ##us for the alternative all ##ele . [SEP]
[CLS] if the first all ##ele is dominant to the second then the fraction of the population that will show the dominant ph ##eno ##type is " p " + 2 " p ##q " , and the fraction with the recess ##ive ph ##eno ##type is " q " . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of genetic disorders are caused when an individual inherit ##s two recess ##ive all ##eles for a single - gene trait . [SEP]
[CLS] recess ##ive genetic disorders include al ##bin ##ism , cy ##stic fi ##bro ##sis , gala ##ct ##ose ##mia , ph ##en ##yl ##ke ##ton ##uria ( p ##ku ) , and tay – sachs disease . [SEP]
[CLS] other disorders are also due to recess ##ive all ##eles , but because the gene locus is located on the x chromosome , so that males have only one copy ( that is , they are hem ##iz ##y ##go ##us ) , they are more frequent in males than in females . [SEP]
[CLS] examples include red - green color blindness and fragile x syndrome . [SEP]
[CLS] other disorders , such as huntington ' s disease , occur when an individual inherit ##s only one dominant all ##ele . [SEP]
[CLS] while her ##ita ##ble traits are typically studied in terms of genetic all ##eles , ep ##igen ##etic marks such as dna methyl ##ation can be inherited at specific gen ##omic regions in certain species , a process termed trans ##gen ##eration ##al ep ##igen ##etic inheritance . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " ep ##ial ##le ##le " is used to distinguish these her ##ita ##ble marks from traditional all ##eles , which are defined by nu ##cle ##otide sequence . [SEP]
[CLS] a specific class of ep ##ial ##le ##le , the meta ##sta ##ble ep ##ial ##le ##les , has been discovered in mice and in humans which is characterized by st ##och ##astic ( pro ##ba ##bilis ##tic ) establishment of ep ##igen ##etic state that can be mit ##otic ##ally inherited . [SEP]
