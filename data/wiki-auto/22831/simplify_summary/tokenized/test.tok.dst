[CLS] oliver he ##avi ##side frs ( ; 18 may 1850 – 3 february 1925 ) was an english self - taught electrical engineer , mathematician , and physicist who adapted complex numbers to the study of electrical circuits , invented mathematical techniques for the solution of differential equations ( equivalent to lap ##lace transforms ) , reform ##ulated maxwell ' s field equations in terms of electric and magnetic forces and energy flux , and independently co - formulated vector analysis . [SEP]
[CLS] although at odds with the scientific establishment for most of his life , he ##avi ##side changed the face of telecommunications , mathematics , and science for years to come . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side was born in camden town , london , at 55 kings street ( now pl ##end ##er street ) . [SEP]
[CLS] he was a short and red - headed child , and suffered from scarlet fever when young , which left him with a hearing impairment . [SEP]
[CLS] a small legacy enabled the family to move to a better part of camden when he was thirteen and he was sent to camden house grammar school . [SEP]
[CLS] he was a good student , placed fifth out of five hundred students in 1865 , but his parents could not keep him at school after he was 16 , so he continued studying for a year by himself and had no further formal education . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side ' s uncle by marriage was sir charles wheat ##stone ( 1802 – 1875 ) , an internationally celebrated expert in telegraph ##y and electro ##ma ##gne ##tism , and the original co - inventor of the first commercially successful telegraph in the mid - 1830s . [SEP]
[CLS] wheat ##stone took a strong interest in his nephew ' s education and in 1867 sent him north to work with his own , older brother arthur , who was managing one of wheat ##stone ' s telegraph companies in newcastle - upon - tyne . [SEP]
[CLS] two years later he took a job as a telegraph operator with the danish great northern telegraph company laying a cable from newcastle to denmark using british contractors . [SEP]
[CLS] he soon became an electric ##ian . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side continued to study while working , and by the age of 22 he published an article in the prestigious " philosophical magazine " on ' the best arrangement of wheat ##stone ' s bridge for measuring a given resistance with a given gal ##van ##ometer and battery ' which received positive comments from physicist ##s who had unsuccessfully tried to solve this algebraic problem , including sir william thomson , to whom he gave a copy of the paper , and james clerk maxwell . [SEP]
[CLS] when he published an article on the du ##plex method of using a telegraph cable , he poked fun at r . s . cu ##lley , the engineer in chief of the post office telegraph system , who had been dismissing du ##plex as imp ##rac ##tical . [SEP]
[CLS] later in 1873 his application to join the society of telegraph engineers was turned down with the comment that " they didn ' t want telegraph clerks " . [SEP]
[CLS] this ri ##led he ##avi ##side , who asked thomson to sponsor him , and along with support of the society ' s president he was admitted " despite the p . o . s ##nob ##s " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1873 he ##avi ##side had encountered maxwell ' s newly published , and later famous , two - volume " treatise on electricity and magnet ##ism " . [SEP]
[CLS] undertaking research from home , he helped develop transmission line theory ( also known as the " " telegraph ##er ' s equations " " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side showed mathematical ##ly that uniformly distributed ind ##uc ##tance in a telegraph line would dim ##ini ##sh both at ##ten ##uation and distortion , and that , if the ind ##uc ##tance were great enough and the insulation resistance not too high , the circuit would be distortion ##less in that currents of all frequencies would have equal speeds of propagation . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side ' s equations helped further the implementation of the telegraph . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1882 to 1902 , except for three years , he contributed regular articles to the trade paper " the electric ##ian " , which wished to improve its standing , for which he was paid £ ##40 per year . [SEP]
[CLS] this was hardly enough to live on , but his demands were very small and he was doing what he most wanted to . [SEP]
[CLS] between 1883 and 1887 these averaged 2 – 3 articles per month and these articles later formed the bulk of his " electromagnetic theory " and " electrical papers " . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1880 , he ##avi ##side researched the skin effect in telegraph transmission lines . [SEP]
[CLS] that same year he patented , in england , the coa ##xia ##l cable . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1884 he rec ##ast maxwell ' s mathematical analysis from its original cum ##bers ##ome form ( they had already been rec ##ast as qu ##ater ##nio ##ns ) to its modern vector terminology , thereby reducing twelve of the original twenty equations in twenty unknown ##s down to the four differential equations in two unknown ##s we now know as maxwell ' s equations . [SEP]
[CLS] the four re - formulated maxwell ' s equations describe the nature of electric charges ( both static and moving ) , magnetic fields , and the relationship between the two , namely electromagnetic fields . [SEP]
[CLS] between 1880 and 1887 , he ##avi ##side developed the operational calculus using " p " for the differential operator , ( which boo ##le had previously denoted by " d " ) , giving a method of solving differential equations by direct solution as algebraic equations . [SEP]
[CLS] this later caused a great deal of controversy , owing to its lack of rig ##our . [SEP]
[CLS] he famously said , " mathematics is an experimental science , and definitions do not come first , but later on . [SEP]
[CLS] they make themselves , when the nature of the subject has developed itself . " [SEP]
[CLS] on another occasion he asked somewhat more defensive ##ly , " shall i refuse my dinner because i do not fully understand the process of digest ##ion ? " [SEP]
[CLS] in 1887 , he ##avi ##side worked with his brother arthur on a paper entitled " the bridge system of tel ##ep ##hony " . [SEP]
[CLS] however the paper was blocked by arthur ' s superior , william henry pre ##ece of the post office , because part of the proposal was that loading coil ##s ( ind ##uc ##tors ) should be added to telephone and telegraph lines to increase their self - induction and correct the distortion which they suffered . [SEP]
[CLS] pre ##ece had recently declared self - ind ##uc ##tance to be the great enemy of clear transmission . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side was also convinced that pre ##ece was behind the sack ##ing of the editor of " the electric ##ian " which brought his long - running series of articles to a halt ( until 1891 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there was a long history of an ##imo ##sity between pre ##ece and he ##avi ##side . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side considered pre ##ece to be mathematical ##ly inc ##omp ##ete ##nt , an assessment supported by the biographer paul j . nah ##in : " pre ##ece was a powerful government official , enormous ##ly ambitious , and in some remarkable ways , an utter block ##head . " [SEP]
[CLS] pre ##ece ' s motivation ##s in suppress ##ing he ##avi ##side ' s work were more to do with protecting pre ##ece ' s own reputation and avoiding having to admit error than any perceived faults in he ##avi ##side ' s work . [SEP]
[CLS] the importance of he ##avi ##side ' s work remained und ##is ##co ##vered for some time after publication in " the electric ##ian " , and so its rights lay in the public domain . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1897 , at & t employed one of its own scientists , george a . campbell , and an external investigator michael i . pup ##in to find some respect in which he ##avi ##side ' s work was incomplete or incorrect . [SEP]
[CLS] campbell and pup ##in extended he ##avi ##side ' s work , and at & t filed for patents covering not only their research , but also the technical method of constructing the coil ##s previously invented by he ##avi ##side . [SEP]
[CLS] at & t later offered he ##avi ##side money in exchange for his rights ; it is possible that the bell engineers ' respect for he ##avi ##side influenced this offer . [SEP]
[CLS] however , he ##avi ##side refused the offer , declining to accept any money unless the company were to give him full recognition . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side was chronic ##ally poor , making his refusal of the offer even more striking . [SEP]
[CLS] but this set ##back had the effect of turning he ##avi ##side ' s attention towards electromagnetic radiation , and in two papers of 1888 and 1889 , he calculated the deformation ##s of electric and magnetic fields surrounding a moving charge , as well as the effects of it entering a dense ##r medium . [SEP]
[CLS] this included a prediction of what is now known as cher ##enko ##v radiation , and inspired his friend george fitzgerald to suggest what now is known as the loren ##tz – fitzgerald contraction . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1889 , he ##avi ##side first published a correct derivation of the magnetic force on a moving charged particle , which is now called the loren ##tz force . [SEP]
[CLS] in the late 1880s and early 1890s , he ##avi ##side worked on the concept of electromagnetic mass . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side treated this as material mass , capable of producing the same effects . [SEP]
[CLS] wilhelm wien later verified he ##avi ##side ' s expression ( for low ve ##lo ##cit ##ies ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1891 the british royal society recognized he ##avi ##side ' s contributions to the mathematical description of electromagnetic phenomena by naming him a fellow of the royal society , and the following year dev ##oting more than fifty pages of the " philosophical transactions " of the society to his vector methods and electromagnetic theory . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1905 he ##avi ##side was given an honorary doctorate by the university of gottingen . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1896 , fitzgerald and john perry obtained a civil list pension of £1 ##20 per year for he ##avi ##side , who was now living in devon , and persuaded him to accept it , after he had rejected other charitable offers from the royal society . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1902 , he ##avi ##side proposed the existence of what is now known as the ken ##nell ##y – he ##avi ##side layer of the ion ##osphere . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side ' s proposal included means by which radio signals are transmitted around the earth ' s curvature . [SEP]
[CLS] the existence of the ion ##osphere was confirmed in 1923 . [SEP]
[CLS] the predictions by he ##avi ##side , combined with planck ' s radiation theory , probably discouraged further attempts to detect radio waves from the sun and other astronomical objects . [SEP]
[CLS] for whatever reason , there seem to have been no attempts for 30 years , until jan ##sky ' s development of radio astronomy in 1932 . [SEP]
[CLS] in later years his behavior became quite eccentric . [SEP]
[CLS] according to associate b . a . be ##hre ##nd , he became a rec ##lus ##e who was so ave ##rse to meeting people that he delivered the manuscripts of his " electric ##ian " papers to a grocery store , where the editors picked them up . [SEP]
[CLS] though he had been an active cyclist in his youth , his health seriously declined in his sixth decade . [SEP]
[CLS] during this time he ##avi ##side would sign letters with the initials " " w . o . r . m . " " after his name . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side also reportedly started painting his fingernails pink and had granite blocks moved into his house for furniture . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1922 , he became the first recipient of the far ##aday medal , which was established that year . [SEP]
[CLS] on he ##avi ##side ' s religious views , he was a unitarian , but not a religious one . [SEP]
[CLS] he was even said to have made fun of people who put their faith in a supreme being . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side died on 3 february 1925 , at tor ##quay in devon after falling from a ladder , and is buried near the eastern corner of pa ##ign ##ton cemetery . [SEP]
[CLS] he is buried with his father , thomas he ##avi ##side ( 1813 – 1896 ) and his mother , rachel elizabeth he ##avi ##side . [SEP]
[CLS] the graves ##tone was cleaned thanks to an anonymous donor sometime in 2005 . [SEP]
[CLS] most of his recognition was gained posthumously . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 2014 , academics at newcastle university , uk and the newcastle electromagnetic ##s interest group founded the he ##avi ##side memorial project in a bid to fully restore the monument through public subscription . [SEP]
[CLS] the restored memorial was ceremonial ##ly unveiled on 30 august 2014 by alan heather , a distant relative of he ##avi ##side . [SEP]
[CLS] the un ##ve ##iling was attended by the mayor of tor ##bay , the mp for tor ##bay , an ex - curator of the science museum ( representing the institution of engineering and technology ) , the chairman of the tor ##bay civic society , and delegates from newcastle university . [SEP]
[CLS] a collection of he ##avi ##side ' s notebook ##s , papers , correspondence , notes and ann ##ota ##ted pamphlets on telegraph ##y is held at the institution of engineering and technology ( ie ##t ) archive centre . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side did much to develop and advocate vector methods and vector calculus . [SEP]
[CLS] maxwell ' s formulation of electro ##ma ##gne ##tism consisted of 20 equations in 20 variables . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side employed the curl and diver ##gence operators of the vector calculus to reform ##ulate 12 of these 20 equations into four equations in four variables ( b , e , j , and ρ ) , the form by which they have been known ever since ( see maxwell ' s equations ) . [SEP]
[CLS] less well known is that he ##avi ##side ' s equations and maxwell ' s are not exactly the same , and in fact it is easier to modify the former to make them compatible with quantum physics . [SEP]
[CLS] the possibility of gravitational waves was also discussed by he ##avi ##side using the analogy between the inverse - square law in gr ##avi ##tation and electricity . [SEP]
[CLS] he invented the he ##avi ##side step function , using it to calculate the current when an electric circuit is switched on . [SEP]
[CLS] he was the first to use the unit impulse function now usually known as the dir ##ac delta function . [SEP]
[CLS] he invented his operational calculus method for solving linear differential equations . [SEP]
[CLS] this resembles the currently used lap ##lace transform method based on the " bromwich integral " named after bromwich who devised a rigorous mathematical justification for he ##avi ##side ' s operator method using con ##tour integration . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side was familiar with the lap ##lace transform method but considered his own method more direct . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side developed the transmission line theory ( also known as the " telegraph ##er ' s equations " ) , which had the effect of increasing the transmission rate over transatlantic cables by a factor of ten . [SEP]
[CLS] it originally took ten minutes to transmit each character , and this immediately improved to one character per minute . [SEP]
[CLS] closely related to this was his discovery that telephone transmission could be greatly improved by placing electrical ind ##uc ##tance in series with the cable . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side also independently discovered the po ##yn ##ting vector . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##avi ##side advanced the idea that the earth ' s upper ##most atmosphere contained an ion ##ized layer known as the ion ##osphere ; in this regard , he predicted the existence of what later was dubbed the ken ##nell ##y – he ##avi ##side layer . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1947 edward victor appleton received the nobel prize in physics for proving that this layer really existed . [SEP]
