he was well regarded by his contemporaries , including h . l . mencken , edmund wilson , and sinclair lewis .
his works were considered escapist and fit well in the culture of the 1920s , when they were most popular .
for cabell , veracity was " the one unpardonable sin , not merely against art , but against human welfare . "
he saw art as an escape from life , but once the artist creates his ideal world , he finds that it is made up of the same elements that make the real one .
this has been due to his failure to move out of his fantasy niche despite the onset of world war ii .
alfred kazin said that " cabell and hitler did not inhabit the same universe " .
cabell 's great-grandfather , william h . cabell , was governor of virginia from 1805 to 1808 .

the book was denounced by the new york society for the suppression of vice .
the case went on for two years before cabell and his publisher , robert m . mcbride , won .
the most that can be said against the book is that certain passages therein may be suggestive in a veiled and subtle way of immorality , but such suggestions are conveyed " and that because of cabell 's writing style or even if it is very limited by a book or even if it is not enough to be read by a book .
the revised edition of 1926 included a previously " lost " section in which the hero is put on trial by the philistines , with a large dung-beetle as the chief prosecutor .
in the early 1920s , he became associated with some critics with a group of writers referred to as , " the james branch cabell school " .
a great deal of cabell 's work has focused on " the biography of the life of manuel " , the story of a character named dom manuel and his descendants through many generations .
cabell said that he considered the " biography " to be a single work , and supervised its publication in a single uniform edition of 18 volumes , known as the " storisende edition " , published from 1927 to 1930 .
a number of volumes of the biography were also published in editions illustrated by frank c . pape between 1921 and 1926 .

after concluding the " biography " in 1932 , cabell shortened his professional name to " branch cabell " .
the truncated name was used for all his new , " post-" biography " publications until the printing of " there were two pirates " paces 1946 cannabis was used for the printing of " there werense pirates " .
though cabell is best known as a fantasist , the plots and characters of his first few novels , " the eagle 's shadow " egypt , and " the rivet in grandfather 's neck " , are later adapted for inclusion in the " biography " of virginia gentry .

his later novel , " the first gentleman of america : a comedy of conquest " — 1942 indochina canalised the strange career of an american indian from the shores of the potomac who sailed away with spanish explorers , later to return , be made chief of his tribe , and kill all the spaniards in the new virginia settlement .

cabell had close friendship with well-known richmond writer ellen glasgow , whose house on west main street was only a few blocks from cabell 's family home on east franklin street .
they corresponded a lot between 1923 and glasgow 's death in 1945 and over 200 of their letters survive .

his three-act play " the jewel merchants " was used for the libretto of an opera by louis cheslock .
michael swanwick published a critical monograph on cabell 's work , which argues for the value of a few of cabell 's works – notably " jurgen " , " the cream of the jest " , and " the silver stallion " .
swanwick places much of the blame for cabell 's obscurity on cabell himself , for authorising the 18-volume storisende uniform edition of the " biography of the life of manuel " , including much that was of poor quality and ephemeral .
standing at the helm of the single most successful literary career of any fantasist of the twentieth century , he drove the great ship of his career straight and unerringly onto the rocks .
