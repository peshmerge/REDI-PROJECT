[CLS] the novel was denounced by the new york society for the suppression of vice ; they attempted to bring a prosecution for ob ##sc ##enity . [SEP]
[CLS] the case went on for two years before cab ##ell and his publisher , robert m . mcbride , won : the " ind ##ece ##ncies " were double en ##ten ##dre ##s that also had a perfectly decent interpretation , though it appeared that what had actually offended the prosecution most was a joke about papal in ##fall ##ibility . [SEP]
[CLS] the presiding judge , charles cooper not ##t , jr . , wrote in his decision that " . . . the most that can be said against the book is that certain passages there ##in may be considered suggest ##ive in a veil ##ed and subtle way of im ##moral ##ity , but such suggestions are delicately conveyed " and that because of cab ##ell ' s writing style " . . . it is doubtful if the book could be read or understood at all by more than a very limited number of readers . " [SEP]
[CLS] cab ##ell took an author ' s revenge : the revised edition of 1926 included a previously " lost " passage in which the hero is placed on trial by the phil ##ist ##ines , with a large dung - beetle as the chief prosecutor . [SEP]
[CLS] he also wrote a short book , " taboo " , in which he thanks john h . sumner and the society for suppression of vice for generating the publicity that gave his career a boost . [SEP]
[CLS] due to the notoriety of the suppression of " jurgen " , cab ##ell became a figure of international fame . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 1920s , he became associated by some critics with a group of writers referred to as , " the james branch cab ##ell school , " which included such figures as h . l . men ##cken , carl van ve ##cht ##en and eli ##nor wylie . [SEP]
[CLS] a great deal of cab ##ell ' s work has focused on " the biography of the life of manuel " , the story of a character named dom manuel and his descendants through many generations . [SEP]
[CLS] the biography includes a total of 25 works that were written over a 23 - year period . [SEP]

[CLS] a number of the volumes of the biography were also published in editions illustrated by frank c . pa ##pe between 1921 and 1926 . [SEP]
[CLS] the themes and characters from " jurgen " make appearances in many works included in the biography . [SEP]
[CLS] " figures of earth " tells the story of manuel the sw ##ine ##her ##d , a morally ambiguous protagonist who rises to conquer a realm by playing on others ' expectations — his motto being mu ##nd ##us vu ##lt dec ##ip ##i , meaning " the world wishes to be dec ##ei ##ved . " [SEP]
[CLS] " the silver stallion " is a loose sequel to " figures of earth " that deals with the creation of the legend of manuel the red ##eem ##er , in which manuel is pictured as an in ##fall ##ible hero , an example to which all others should as ##pire ; the story is told by manuel ' s former knights , who remember how things really were and take different approaches to rec ##on ##ci ##ling the mythology with the actual ##ity of manuel . [SEP]
[CLS] many of these books take place in the fictional country eventually ruled by manuel , known as " po ##ic ##tes ##me " , ( pronounced " p ##wa - te ##m " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it was the author ' s intention to situ ##ate po ##ic ##tes ##me roughly in the south of france . [SEP]
[CLS] the name suggests the two real french cities of po ##iti ##ers ( medieval po ##ic ##tier ##s ) and ang ##ou ##lem ##e ( medieval ang ##ou ##les ##me ) . [SEP]
[CLS] several other books take place in the fictional town of li ##chfield , virginia . [SEP]
[CLS] after concluding the " biography " in 1932 , cab ##ell shortened his professional name to " branch cab ##ell " . [SEP]
[CLS] the truncated name was used for all his new , " post - " biography " " publications until the printing of " there were two pirates " ( 1946 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] though cab ##ell is best known as a fan ##tas ##ist , the plots and characters of his first few novels , " the eagle ' s shadow " ( 1904 ) , " the cords of vanity " ( 1909 ) , and " the ri ##vet in grandfather ' s neck " ( 1915 ) ( later all adapted for inclusion into the " biography " ) , do not wander out of the everyday society of virginia ' s bel ##ea ##gue ##red gentry . [SEP]
[CLS] but cab ##ell ' s signature dr ##oll style is clearly in evidence , and in later printing ##s each book would bear a characteristic ##ally cab ##elli ##an sub ##ti ##tle : " a comedy of purse - strings " , " a comedy of shi ##rkin ##g " , and " a comedy of limitations " , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] his later novel , " the first gentleman of america : a comedy of conquest " ( 1942 ) , re ##tell ##s the strange career of an american indian from the shores of the potomac who sailed away with spanish explorers , later to return , be made chief of his tribe , and kill all the spaniards in the new virginia settlement . [SEP]

[CLS] robert a . he ##in ##lein was greatly inspired by cab ##ell ' s bold ##ness , and originally described his book " stranger in a strange land " as " a cab ##elles ##que satire . " [SEP]
[CLS] a later work , " " derived its title from " jurgen " and contains appearances by jurgen and the slavic god ko ##sche ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] fritz lei ##ber ' s " swords of lan ##kh ##mar " was influenced by " jurgen " . [SEP]
[CLS] charles g . finn ##ey ' s fantasy " the circus of dr . lao " was influenced by cab ##ell ' s work . [SEP]
[CLS] the ave ##roi ##gne stories of clark ashton smith are , in background , close to those of cab ##ell ' s po ##ic ##tes ##me . [SEP]
[CLS] jack vance ' s dying earth books show considerable stylistic resemblance ##s to cab ##ell ; cu ##gel the clever in those books bears a strong resemblance , not least in his opinion of himself , to jurgen . [SEP]
[CLS] cab ##ell was also a major influence on neil ga ##iman , acknowledged as such in the rear of ga ##iman ' s novels " star ##dust " and " american gods " . [SEP]
[CLS] this thematic and stylistic influence is highly evident in the multi - layered pantheon ##s of ga ##iman ' s work , " the sand ##man " , which have many parallels in cab ##ell ' s work , particularly " jurgen " . [SEP]
[CLS] cab ##ell maintained a close and lifelong friendship with well - known richmond writer ellen glasgow , whose house on west main street was only a few blocks from cab ##ell ' s family home on east franklin street . [SEP]
[CLS] they corresponded extensively between 1923 and glasgow ' s death in 1945 and over 200 of their letters survive . [SEP]
[CLS] cab ##ell dedicated his 1927 novel " something about eve " to her , and she in turn dedicated her book " they st ##ooped to folly : a comedy of morals " ( 1929 ) to cab ##ell . [SEP]
[CLS] in her autobiography , glasgow also gave considerable thanks to cab ##ell for his help in the editing of her pulitzer prize - winning book " in this our life " ( 1941 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] however , late in their lives , friction developed between the two writers as a result of cab ##ell ' s critical 1943 review of glasgow ' s novel " a certain measure " . [SEP]
[CLS] cab ##ell also admired the work of the atlanta - based writer frances newman , though their correspondence was cut short by her premature death in 1928 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1929 , cab ##ell supplied the preface to newman ' s collected letters . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1969 through 1972 , the ball ##ant ##ine adult fantasy series returned six of cab ##ell ' s novels to print , and elevated his profile in the fantasy genre . [SEP]
[CLS] today , many more of his works are available from wild ##side press . [SEP]
[CLS] cab ##ell ' s three - character one - act play " the jewel merchants " was used for the libretto of an opera by louis che ##sl ##ock which premiered in 1940 . [SEP]
[CLS] michael swan ##wick published a critical monograph on cab ##ell ' s work , which argues for the continued value of a few of cab ##ell ' s works — notably " jurgen " , " the cream of the je ##st " , and " the silver stallion " — while acknowledging that some of his writing has dated badly . [SEP]
[CLS] swan ##wick places much of the blame for cab ##ell ' s ob ##scu ##rity on cab ##ell himself , for author ##ising the 18 - volume st ##oris ##end ##e uniform edition of the " biography of the life of manuel " , including much that was of poor quality and ep ##hem ##eral . [SEP]
[CLS] this alien ##ated admire ##rs and scared off potential new readers . [SEP]
[CLS] " there are , ala ##s , an infinite number of ways for a writer to destroy himself , " swan ##wick wrote . [SEP]
[CLS] " james branch cab ##ell chose one of the more interesting . [SEP]
[CLS] standing at the helm of the single most successful literary career of any fan ##tas ##ist of the twentieth century , he drove the great ship of his career straight and une ##rring ##ly onto the rocks . " [SEP]
[CLS] other book - length studies on cab ##ell were written during the period of his fame by hugh wal ##pole , w . a . mc ##neil ##l , and carl van do ##ren . [SEP]
[CLS] edmund wilson tried to rehab ##ili ##tate his reputation with a long essay in " the new yorker " . [SEP]
