their importance is considered equal to those of the bergonzi , guarneri , and stradivari families .
makers from nearby brescia experimented , such as gasparo da salo , micheli , zanetto and pellegrino , but it was andrea amati in cremona , italy , who gave the modern violin family profile .
a number of his instruments survived for some time .
the largest number these are from 1560 , a set for an entire orchestra of 38 ordered by catherine de medicis the regent queen of france .
he made violins , violas and cellos .
they were in use until the french revolution of 1789 .
his work is marked by selection of the finest materials , soft clear amber , soft translucent varnish , and an in depth use of acoustic and geometrical principles in design .
they are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of viola , in contrast to older tenor violas .
he improved the model adopted by the rest of the amatis .
his pattern was unusually small , but he also made a wider model now known as the " grand amati " , which have become his most sought-after violins .
the most famous of his pupils were antonio stradivari and andrea guarneri .
the label on stradivari 's first known violin states that he was a pupil of amati .
although he improved on the arching of his father 's instruments , by and large they are inferior and no match for the greatest maker of his day , antonio stradivari .
the instruments in the uk include andrea amati violins from the set delivered to charles ix of france in 1564 .
