in modern cars the engine is often located directly behind the driver , and drives the rear wheels .
depending on the rules of the class , many types of open-wheelers have wings at the front and rear of the vehicle , as well as a very low and flat undertray that achieve additional aerodynamic downforce pushing the car onto the road .
some major races , such as the monaco grand prix , are held on temporary street circuits .
most open-wheel races are on dedicated road courses , such as nurburgring in germany , spa-francorchamps in belgium and silverstone in great britain .

an example of this is the 2005 chicagoland crash of ryan briscoe with alex barron .
the lower weight of an open-wheel racecar allows for better performance .
this allows improved cooling of the brakes .
