[CLS] an open - wheel car ( formula car , or often single - seater car in british english ) is a car with the wheels outside the car ' s main body , and usually having only one seat . [SEP]
[CLS] open - wheel cars contrast with street cars , sports cars , stock cars , and touring cars , which have their wheels below the body or inside fender ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] open - wheel cars are usually built specifically for road racing , frequently with a higher degree of technological so ##phi ##stic ##ation than in other forms of motor sport . [SEP]
[CLS] open - wheel street cars , such as the ariel atom , are very scarce as they are often imp ##rac ##tical for everyday use . [SEP]
[CLS] american race ##car driver and construct ##or ray ha ##rro ##un was an early pioneer of the concept of a lightweight single - seater , open - wheel " mono ##post ##o " race ##car . [SEP]
[CLS] after working as a mechanic in the automotive industry , ha ##rro ##un began competitive professional racing in 1906 , winning the aaa national championship in 1910 . [SEP]
[CLS] he was then hired by the mar ##mon motor car company as chief engineer , charged with building a race ##car intended to race at the very first indianapolis 500 , which he went on to win . [SEP]
[CLS] he developed a revolutionary concept which would become the origin ##ator and fore ##fat ##her of the single - seater ( i . e . mono ##post ##o ) race ##car design . [SEP]
[CLS] ha ##rro ##un has also been credited by some as pioneering the rear - view mirror which appeared on his 1911 indianapolis 500 winning car , though he himself claimed he got the idea from seeing a mirror used for a similar purpose on a horse - drawn vehicle in 1904 . [SEP]
[CLS] a typical open - wheeler has a minimal cockpit sufficient only to en ##cl ##ose the driver ' s body , with the head exposed to the air . [SEP]
[CLS] in the w ##hel ##en modified tour and other short track modified series , the driver ' s head is contained in the car . [SEP]
[CLS] in modern cars the engine is often located directly behind the driver , and drives the rear wheels ; except in asphalt modified cars , such as the w ##hel ##en modified tour , where the engine is in front of the driver . [SEP]
[CLS] depending on the rules of the class , many types of open - wheeler ##s have wings at the front and rear of the vehicle , as well as a very low and virtually flat under ##tray that helps achieve additional aerodynamic down ##force pushing the car onto the road . [SEP]
[CLS] some major races , such as the singapore grand prix , monaco grand prix ( sanctioned by formula one ) and the long beach grand prix ( sanctioned by indy ##car ) , are held on temporary street circuits . [SEP]
[CLS] however , most open - wheel races are on dedicated road courses , such as watkins glen international in the us , nur ##burg ##ring in germany , spa - franco ##rch ##amps in belgium and silver ##stone in great britain . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states some top - level open - wheel events are held on oval ##s , of both short track and super ##sp ##eed ##way variety , with an emphasis being placed more on speed and endurance than the maneuver ##ability inherently required by road and street course events . [SEP]
[CLS] the w ##hel ##en modified tour is the only opened wheeled race car series endorsed by nascar . [SEP]
[CLS] this series races on most of nascar ' s most famous tracks in the united states . [SEP]
[CLS] other asphalt modified series race on short tracks in the united states and canada , such as wyoming county international speedway in new york . [SEP]
[CLS] the most well - attended oval race in the world is the annual indianapolis 500 ( indy 500 ) in speedway , indiana , sanctioned by indy ##car ; in the united states , it is quite common to refer to open - wheel cars as indy ##cars , or champ cars , because of their recognizable appearance and widespread popularity across america at the indy 500 . [SEP]
[CLS] open - wheeled racing is among the fastest in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] formula 1 cars can reach speeds in excess of 360 km / h . [SEP]
[CLS] at auto ##dro ##mo nazi ##onale mon ##za , antonio pi ##zzo ##nia of bmw williams f1 team recorded a top speed of 36 ##9 . 9 km / h in the 2004 italian grand prix . [SEP]
[CLS] since the end of the v ##10 era in 2006 speeds like this have not been reached , with contemporary machinery reaching around 360 km / h . [SEP]
[CLS] it is difficult to give precise figures for the absolute top speeds of formula 1 cars , as the cars do not have speed ##ometer ##s as such and the data are not generally released by teams . [SEP]
[CLS] the ' speed traps ' on fast circuits such as mon ##za give a good indication , but are not necessarily located at the point on the track where the car is travelling at its fastest . [SEP]
[CLS] bar honda team recorded an average top speed of 400 km / h in 2006 at bonn ##eville salt flats with unofficial top speed reaching 41 ##3 km / h using modified bar 00 ##7 formula 1 car . [SEP]
[CLS] speeds on oval ##s can range in constant excess of 210 - , and at indianapolis in excess of 230 mph . [SEP]
[CLS] some sources claim that in 1996 , paul tracy recorded a trap speed of 256 . 94 ##8 mph at michigan international speedway . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2000 , gil de fe ##rran set the one - lap qualifying record of 241 . 42 ##8 mph at california speedway . [SEP]
[CLS] even on tight non - oval street circuits such as the grand prix of toronto , open - wheel indy cars attain speeds of 190 mph . [SEP]
[CLS] driving an open - wheel car is substantially different from driving a car with fender ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] virtually all formula one and indy ##car drivers spent some time in various open - wheel categories before joining either top series . [SEP]
[CLS] open - wheel vehicles , due to their light weight , aerodynamic capabilities , and powerful engines , are often considered the fastest racing vehicles available and among the most challenging to master . [SEP]
[CLS] wheel - to - wheel contact is dangerous , particularly when the forward edge of one tire contacts the rear of another tire : since the tread ##s are moving in opposite directions ( one upward , one downward ) at the point of contact , both wheels rapidly dec ##ele ##rate , tor ##quin ##g the chassis of both cars and often causing one or both vehicles to be suddenly and powerful ##ly flung upwards ( the rear car tends to pitch forward , and the front car tends to pitch back . ) [SEP]
[CLS] an example of this is the 2005 chicago ##land crash of ryan br ##is ##coe with alex barron . [SEP]
[CLS] the lower weight of an open - wheel race ##car allows for better performance . [SEP]
[CLS] while the exposure of the wheels to the airs ##tream causes a very high aerodynamic drag at high speeds , it allows improved cooling of the brakes , which is important on road courses with their frequent changes of pace . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2018 , several single seater series such as formula one , formula 2 ( with their new dal ##lar ##a f ##2 2018 chassis ) , and formula e ( with their new spark sr ##t ##0 ##5 ##e chassis ) introduced a protection system to the cockpit called the " halo " , a wish ##bone - shaped frame aimed to def ##le ##ct debris away from a driver ' s head . [SEP]
[CLS] despite initial criticism , it showed some praise in the formula 2 sprint race in cat ##al ##un ##ya when ni ##re ##i fu ##ku ##zumi spun and had the back of his car land on fellow country ##man tad ##as ##uke ma ##kin ##o ' s halo . [SEP]
[CLS] in the formula 1 belgian grand prix , mclaren driver fernando alonso was sent airborne after being hit from behind by the renault of nico hulk ##enberg and struck the halo of sa ##uber driver charles le ##cle ##rc , thereby saving the mon ##ega ##sque driver from a very nasty incident . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2019 , the newly - formed fia formula 3 championship introduced a halo to their new chassis which was unveiled at the 2018 abu dhabi grand prix . [SEP]
