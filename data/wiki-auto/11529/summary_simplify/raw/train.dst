A fermion can be an elementary particle, such as the electron, or it can be a composite particle, such as the proton.
According to the spin-statistics theorem in any reasonable relativistic quantum field theory, particles with integer spin are bosons, while particles with half-integer spin are fermions.
In addition to the spin characteristic, fermions have another specific property: they possess conserved baryon or lepton quantum numbers.
Therefore, what is usually referred to as the spin statistics relation is in fact a spin statistics-quantum number relation.
If multiple fermions have the same spatial probability distribution, then at least one property of each fermion, such as its spin, must be different.
Fermions are usually associated with matter, whereas bosons are generally force carrier particles, although in the current state of particle physics the distinction between the two concepts is unclear.
Composite fermions, such as protons and neutrons, are the key building blocks of everyday matter.
The name fermion was coined by English theoretical physicist Paul Dirac from the surname of Italian physicist Enrico Fermi.
Mathematically, fermions come in three types: Most Standard Model fermions are believed to be Dirac fermions, although it is unknown at this time whether the neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana fermions (or both).
More precisely, because of the relation between spin and statistics, a particle containing an odd number of fermions is itself a fermion.
The number of bosons within a composite particle made up of simple particles bound with a potential has no effect on whether it is a boson or a fermion.
Fermionic or bosonic behavior of a composite particle (or system) is only seen at large (compared to size of the system) distances.
This is the origin of superconductivity and the superfluidity of helium-3: in superconducting materials, electrons interact through the exchange of phonons, forming Cooper pairs, while in helium-3, Cooper pairs are formed via spin fluctuations.
The quasiparticles of the fractional quantum Hall effect are also known as composite fermions, which are electrons with an even number of quantized vortices attached to them.
In a quantum field theory, there can be field configurations of bosons which are topologically twisted.
These are coherent states (or solitons) which behave like a particle, and they can be fermionic even if all the constituent particles are bosons.
Skyrme's original example involved fields which take values on a three-dimensional sphere, the original nonlinear sigma model which describes the large distance behavior of pions.
In Skyrme's model, reproduced in the large N or string approximation to quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the proton and neutron are fermionic topological solitons of the pion field.
Whereas Skyrme's example involved pion physics, there is a much more familiar example in quantum electrodynamics with a magnetic monopole.
A bosonic monopole with the smallest possible magnetic charge and a bosonic version of the electron will form a fermionic dyon.
