[CLS] a fe ##rmi ##on can be an elementary particle , such as the electron , or it can be a composite particle , such as the proton . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the spin - statistics theorem in any reasonable re ##lat ##ivist ##ic quantum field theory , particles with integer spin are bo ##sons , while particles with half - integer spin are fe ##rmi ##ons . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to the spin characteristic , fe ##rmi ##ons have another specific property : they possess conserved bar ##yon or le ##pton quantum numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , what is usually referred to as the spin statistics relation is in fact a spin statistics - quantum number relation . [SEP]
[CLS] if multiple fe ##rmi ##ons have the same spatial probability distribution , then at least one property of each fe ##rmi ##on , such as its spin , must be different . [SEP]
[CLS] fe ##rmi ##ons are usually associated with matter , whereas bo ##sons are generally force carrier particles , although in the current state of particle physics the distinction between the two concepts is unclear . [SEP]
[CLS] composite fe ##rmi ##ons , such as proton ##s and neutron ##s , are the key building blocks of everyday matter . [SEP]
[CLS] the name fe ##rmi ##on was coined by english theoretical physicist paul dir ##ac from the surname of italian physicist enrico fe ##rmi . [SEP]
[CLS] mathematical ##ly , fe ##rmi ##ons come in three types : most standard model fe ##rmi ##ons are believed to be dir ##ac fe ##rmi ##ons , although it is unknown at this time whether the ne ##ut ##rino ##s are dir ##ac or major ##ana fe ##rmi ##ons ( or both ) . [SEP]
[CLS] more precisely , because of the relation between spin and statistics , a particle containing an odd number of fe ##rmi ##ons is itself a fe ##rmi ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] the number of bo ##sons within a composite particle made up of simple particles bound with a potential has no effect on whether it is a bo ##son or a fe ##rmi ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] fe ##rmi ##onic or bo ##sonic behavior of a composite particle ( or system ) is only seen at large ( compared to size of the system ) distances . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the origin of super ##con ##du ##ct ##ivity and the super ##fl ##uid ##ity of helium - 3 : in super ##con ##du ##cting materials , electrons interact through the exchange of ph ##ono ##ns , forming cooper pairs , while in helium - 3 , cooper pairs are formed via spin fluctuations . [SEP]
[CLS] the quasi ##par ##tic ##les of the fraction ##al quantum hall effect are also known as composite fe ##rmi ##ons , which are electrons with an even number of quan ##tized vo ##rti ##ces attached to them . [SEP]
[CLS] in a quantum field theory , there can be field configurations of bo ##sons which are topological ##ly twisted . [SEP]
[CLS] these are coherent states ( or sol ##ito ##ns ) which behave like a particle , and they can be fe ##rmi ##onic even if all the constituent particles are bo ##sons . [SEP]
[CLS] sky ##rm ##e ' s original example involved fields which take values on a three - dimensional sphere , the original nonlinear sigma model which describes the large distance behavior of pi ##ons . [SEP]
[CLS] in sky ##rm ##e ' s model , reproduced in the large n or string approximation to quantum ch ##rom ##od ##yna ##mics ( qc ##d ) , the proton and neutron are fe ##rmi ##onic topological sol ##ito ##ns of the pi ##on field . [SEP]
[CLS] whereas sky ##rm ##e ' s example involved pi ##on physics , there is a much more familiar example in quantum electro ##dy ##nami ##cs with a magnetic mono ##pole . [SEP]
[CLS] a bo ##sonic mono ##pole with the smallest possible magnetic charge and a bo ##sonic version of the electron will form a fe ##rmi ##onic d ##yon . [SEP]
