[CLS] voltage , electric potential difference , electric pressure or electric tension is the difference in electric potential between two points . [SEP]
[CLS] the difference in electric potential between two points ( i . e . , voltage ) in a static electric field is defined as the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points . [SEP]
[CLS] in the international system of units , the derived unit for voltage is named " vol ##t " . [SEP]
[CLS] in si units , work per unit charge is expressed as jo ##ules per co ##ulo ##mb , where 1 vol ##t = 1 jo ##ule ( of work ) per 1 co ##ulo ##mb ( of charge ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the official si definition for " vol ##t " uses power and current , where 1 vol ##t = 1 watt ( of power ) per 1 amp ##ere ( of current ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this definition is equivalent to the more commonly used ' jo ##ules per co ##ulo ##mb ' . [SEP]
[CLS] voltage or electric potential difference is denoted symbolic ##ally by ∆ " v " , but more often simply as " v " , for instance in the context of oh ##m ' s or ki ##rch ##hoff ' s circuit laws . [SEP]
[CLS] electric potential differences between points can be caused by electric charge , by electric current through a magnetic field , by time - varying magnetic fields , or some combination of these three . [SEP]
[CLS] a vol ##tm ##eter can be used to measure the voltage ( or potential difference ) between two points in a system ; often a common reference potential such as the ground of the system is used as one of the points . [SEP]
[CLS] a voltage may represent either a source of energy ( electro ##mot ##ive force ) or lost , used , or stored energy ( potential drop ) . [SEP]
[CLS] there are multiple useful ways to define voltage , including the standard definition mentioned at the start of this page . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also other useful definitions of work per charge ( see this section ) . [SEP]
[CLS] roughly speaking , voltage is defined so that negatively charged objects are pulled towards higher voltage ##s , while positively charged objects are pulled towards lower voltage ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , the conventional current in a wire or resist ##or always flows from higher voltage to lower voltage . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , voltage has been referred to using terms like " tension " and " pressure " . [SEP]
[CLS] even today , the term " tension " is still used , for example within the phrase " high tension " ( h ##t ) which is commonly used in the ##rmi ##onic valve ( vacuum tube ) based electronics . [SEP]
[CLS] the voltage increase from some point formula _ 1 to some point formula _ 2 is given by [SEP]
[CLS] in this case , the voltage increase from point a to point b is equal to the work which would have to be done per unit charge , against the electric field , to move the charge from a to b without causing any acceleration . [SEP]
[CLS] mathematical ##ly , this is expressed as the line integral of the electric field along that path . [SEP]
[CLS] under this definition , the voltage difference between two points is not uniquely defined when there are time - varying magnetic fields since the electric force is not a conservative force in such cases . [SEP]
[CLS] if this definition of voltage is used , any circuit where there are time - varying magnetic fields , such as circuits containing ind ##uc ##tors , will not have a well - defined voltage between nodes in the circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] however , if magnetic fields are suit ##ably contained to each component , then the electric field is conservative in the region exterior to the components , and voltage ##s are well - defined in that region . [SEP]
[CLS] in this case , the voltage across an ind ##uc ##tor , viewed externally , turns out to be [SEP]
[CLS] despite the fact that , internally , the electric field in the coil is zero ( assuming it is a perfect conductor ) . [SEP]
[CLS] using the above definition , the electric potential is not defined whenever magnetic fields change with time . [SEP]
[CLS] in physics , it ' s sometimes useful to general ##ize the electric potential by only considering the conservative part of the electric field . [SEP]
[CLS] where formula _ 6 is the magnetic vector potential . [SEP]
[CLS] the above decomposition is justified by helm ##hol ##tz ' s theorem . [SEP]
[CLS] in this case , the voltage increase from formula _ 1 to formula _ 2 is given by [SEP]
[CLS] where formula _ 10 is the rotational electric field due to time - varying magnetic fields . [SEP]
[CLS] in this case , the voltage between points is always uniquely defined . [SEP]
[CLS] in circuit analysis and electrical engineering , the voltage across an ind ##uc ##tor is not considered to be zero or und ##efined , as the standard definition would suggest . [SEP]
[CLS] this is because electrical engineers use a lump ##ed element model to represent and analyze circuits . [SEP]
[CLS] when using a lump ##ed element model , it is assumed that there are no magnetic fields in the region surrounding the circuit and that the effects of these are contained in ' lump ##ed elements ' , which are ideal ##ized and self - contained circuit elements used to model physical components . [SEP]
[CLS] if the assumption of ne ##gli ##gible leaked fields is too inaccurate , their effects can be modelled by parasitic components . [SEP]
[CLS] in the case of a physical ind ##uc ##tor though , the ideal lump ##ed representation is often accurate . [SEP]
[CLS] this is because the leaked fields of the ind ##uc ##tor are generally ne ##gli ##gible , especially if the ind ##uc ##tor is a toro ##id . [SEP]
[CLS] if leaked fields are ne ##gli ##gible , we find that [SEP]
[CLS] is path - independent , and there is a well - defined voltage across the ind ##uc ##tor ' s terminals . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the reason that measurements with a vol ##tm ##eter across an ind ##uc ##tor are often reasonably independent of the placement of the test leads . [SEP]
[CLS] the vol ##t ( symbol : v ) is the derived unit for electric potential , electric potential difference , and electro ##mot ##ive force . [SEP]
[CLS] the vol ##t is named in honour of the italian physicist alessandro volta ( 1745 – 1827 ) , who invented the volta ##ic pile , possibly the first chemical battery . [SEP]
[CLS] a simple analogy for an electric circuit is water flowing in a closed circuit of pipe ##work , driven by a mechanical pump . [SEP]
[CLS] this can be called a " water circuit " . [SEP]
[CLS] potential difference between two points corresponds to the pressure difference between two points . [SEP]
[CLS] if the pump creates a pressure difference between two points , then water flowing from one point to the other will be able to do work , such as driving a turbine . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , work can be done by an electric current driven by the potential difference provided by a battery . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the voltage provided by a sufficiently - charged automobile battery can " push " a large current through the winding ##s of an automobile ' s starter motor . [SEP]
[CLS] if the pump isn ' t working , it produces no pressure difference , and the turbine will not rotate . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , if the automobile ' s battery is very weak or " dead " ( or " flat " ) , then it will not turn the starter motor . [SEP]
[CLS] the hydraulic analogy is a useful way of understanding many electrical concepts . [SEP]
[CLS] in such a system , the work done to move water is equal to the pressure multiplied by the volume of water moved . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , in an electrical circuit , the work done to move electrons or other charge - carriers is equal to " electrical pressure " multiplied by the quantity of electrical charges moved . [SEP]
[CLS] in relation to " flow " , the larger the " pressure difference " between two points ( potential difference or water pressure difference ) , the greater the flow between them ( electric current or water flow ) . [SEP]
[CLS] specify ##ing a voltage measurement requires explicit or implicit specification of the points across which the voltage is measured . [SEP]
[CLS] when using a vol ##tm ##eter to measure potential difference , one electrical lead of the vol ##tm ##eter must be connected to the first point , one to the second point . [SEP]
[CLS] a common use of the term " voltage " is in describing the voltage dropped across an electrical device ( such as a resist ##or ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the voltage drop across the device can be understood as the difference between measurements at each terminal of the device with respect to a common reference point ( or ground ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the voltage drop is the difference between the two readings . [SEP]
[CLS] two points in an electric circuit that are connected by an ideal conductor without resistance and not within a changing magnetic field have a voltage of zero . [SEP]
[CLS] any two points with the same potential may be connected by a conductor and no current will flow between them . [SEP]
[CLS] the voltage between " a " and " c " is the sum of the voltage between " a " and " b " and the voltage between " b " and " c " . [SEP]
[CLS] the various voltage ##s in a circuit can be computed using ki ##rch ##hoff ' s circuit laws . [SEP]
[CLS] when talking about alternating current ( ac ) there is a difference between instant ##aneous voltage and average voltage . [SEP]
[CLS] instant ##aneous voltage ##s can be added for direct current ( dc ) and ac , but average voltage ##s can be meaningful ##ly added only when they apply to signals that all have the same frequency and phase . [SEP]
[CLS] instruments for measuring voltage ##s include the vol ##tm ##eter , the potent ##iom ##eter , and the os ##ci ##llo ##scope . [SEP]
[CLS] analog vol ##tm ##eter ##s , such as moving - coil instruments , work by measuring the current through a fixed resist ##or , which , according to oh ##m ' s law , is proportional to the voltage across the resist ##or . [SEP]
[CLS] the potent ##iom ##eter works by balancing the unknown voltage against a known voltage in a bridge circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] the cat ##ho ##de - ray os ##ci ##llo ##scope works by amp ##li ##fying the voltage and using it to def ##le ##ct an electron beam from a straight path , so that the def ##le ##ction of the beam is proportional to the voltage . [SEP]
[CLS] a common voltage for flashlight batteries is 1 . 5 vol ##ts ( dc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a common voltage for automobile batteries is 12 vol ##ts ( dc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] common voltage ##s supplied by power companies to consumers are 110 to 120 vol ##ts ( ac ) and 220 to 240 vol ##ts ( ac ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the voltage in electric power transmission lines used to distribute electricity from power stations can be several hundred times greater than consumer voltage ##s , typically 110 to 1200 kv ( ac ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the voltage used in overhead lines to power railway locomotives is between 12 kv and 50 kv ( ac ) or between 1 . 5 kv and 3 kv ( dc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] inside a conduct ##ive material , the energy of an electron is affected not only by the average electric potential , but also by the specific thermal and atomic environment that it is in . [SEP]
[CLS] when a vol ##tm ##eter is connected between two different types of metal , it measures not the electro ##static potential difference , but instead something else that is affected by the ##rm ##od ##yna ##mics . [SEP]
[CLS] the quantity measured by a vol ##tm ##eter is the negative of the difference of the electro ##chemical potential of electrons ( fe ##rmi level ) divided by the electron charge and commonly referred to as the voltage difference , while the pure una ##d ##just ##ed electro ##static potential ( not me ##asurable with a vol ##tm ##eter ) is sometimes called gal ##vani potential . [SEP]
[CLS] the terms " voltage " and " electric potential " are ambiguous in that , in practice , they can refer to " either " of these in different contexts . [SEP]
[CLS] the term " electro ##mot ##ive force " was first used by volta in a letter to giovanni al ##dini in 1798 , and first appeared in a published paper in 1801 in " anna ##les de chi ##mie et de ph ##ys ##ique " . [SEP]
[CLS] volta meant by this a force that was not an electro ##static force , specifically , an electro ##chemical force . [SEP]
[CLS] the term was taken up by michael far ##aday in connection with electromagnetic induction in the 1820s . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a clear definition of voltage and method of measuring it had not been developed at this time . [SEP]
[CLS] volta distinguished em ##f from " tension " ( potential difference ) : the observed potential difference at the terminals of an electro ##chemical cell when it was open circuit must exactly balance the em ##f of the cell so that no current flowed . [SEP]
