The difference in electric potential between two points (i.e., voltage) in a static electric field is defined as the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points.
Voltage or electric potential difference is denoted symbolically by âˆ†"V" , but more often simply as "V", for instance in the context of Ohm's or Kirchhoff's circuit laws.
Electric potential differences between points can be caused by electric charge, by electric current through a magnetic field, by time-varying magnetic fields, or some combination of these three.
A voltmeter can be used to measure the voltage (or potential difference) between two points in a system; often a common reference potential such as the ground of the system is used as one of the points.
There are multiple useful ways to define voltage, including the standard definition mentioned at the start of this page.
There are also other useful definitions of work per charge (see this section).
Even today, the term "tension" is still used, for example within the phrase "high tension" (HT) which is commonly used in thermionic valve (vacuum tube) based electronics.
The voltage increase from some point formula_1 to some point formula_2 is given by
In this case, the voltage increase from point A to point B is equal to the work which would have to be done per unit charge, against the electric field, to move the charge from A to B without causing any acceleration.
Under this definition, the voltage difference between two points is not uniquely defined when there are time-varying magnetic fields since the electric force is not a conservative force in such cases.
If this definition of voltage is used, any circuit where there are time-varying magnetic fields, such as circuits containing inductors, will not have a well-defined voltage between nodes in the circuit.
However, if magnetic fields are suitably contained to each component, then the electric field is conservative in the region exterior to the components, and voltages are well-defined in that region.
In this case, the voltage across an inductor, viewed externally, turns out to be
despite the fact that, internally, the electric field in the coil is zero (assuming it is a perfect conductor).
In physics, it's sometimes useful to generalize the electric potential by only considering the conservative part of the electric field.
where formula_6 is the magnetic vector potential.
In this case, the voltage increase from formula_1 to formula_2 is given by
where formula_10 is the rotational electric field due to time-varying magnetic fields.
When using a lumped element model, it is assumed that there are no magnetic fields in the region surrounding the circuit and that the effects of these are contained in 'lumped elements', which are idealized and self-contained circuit elements used to model physical components.
If the assumption of negligible leaked fields is too inaccurate, their effects can be modelled by parasitic components.
In the case of a physical inductor though, the ideal lumped representation is often accurate.
This is because the leaked fields of the inductor are generally negligible, especially if the inductor is a toroid.
If leaked fields are negligible, we find that
is path-independent, and there is a well-defined voltage across the inductor's terminals.
This is the reason that measurements with a voltmeter across an inductor are often reasonably independent of the placement of the test leads.
The volt (symbol: V ) is the derived unit for electric potential, electric potential difference, and electromotive force.
If the pump creates a pressure difference between two points, then water flowing from one point to the other will be able to do work, such as driving a turbine.
Similarly, work can be done by an electric current driven by the potential difference provided by a battery.
For example, the voltage provided by a sufficiently-charged automobile battery can "push" a large current through the windings of an automobile's starter motor.
Specifying a voltage measurement requires explicit or implicit specification of the points across which the voltage is measured.
When using a voltmeter to measure potential difference, one electrical lead of the voltmeter must be connected to the first point, one to the second point.
A common use of the term "voltage" is in describing the voltage dropped across an electrical device (such as a resistor).
The voltage drop across the device can be understood as the difference between measurements at each terminal of the device with respect to a common reference point (or ground).
Instantaneous voltages can be added for direct current (DC) and AC, but average voltages can be meaningfully added only when they apply to signals that all have the same frequency and phase.
Instruments for measuring voltages include the voltmeter, the potentiometer, and the oscilloscope.
The cathode-ray oscilloscope works by amplifying the voltage and using it to deflect an electron beam from a straight path, so that the deflection of the beam is proportional to the voltage.
The voltage in electric power transmission lines used to distribute electricity from power stations can be several hundred times greater than consumer voltages, typically 110 to 1200 kV (AC).
Inside a conductive material, the energy of an electron is affected not only by the average electric potential, but also by the specific thermal and atomic environment that it is in.
When a voltmeter is connected between two different types of metal, it measures not the electrostatic potential difference, but instead something else that is affected by thermodynamics.
The quantity measured by a voltmeter is the negative of the difference of the electrochemical potential of electrons (Fermi level) divided by the electron charge and commonly referred to as the voltage difference, while the pure unadjusted electrostatic potential (not measurable with a voltmeter) is sometimes called Galvani potential.
The terms "voltage" and "electric potential" are ambiguous in that, in practice, they can refer to "either" of these in different contexts.
The term "electromotive force" was first used by Volta in a letter to Giovanni Aldini in 1798, and first appeared in a published paper in 1801 in "Annales de chimie et de physique".
However, a clear definition of voltage and method of measuring it had not been developed at this time.
Volta distinguished emf from "tension" (potential difference): the observed potential difference at the terminals of an electrochemical cell when it was open circuit must exactly balance the emf of the cell so that no current flowed.
