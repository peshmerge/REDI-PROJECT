[CLS] a ceramic ( — , " potter ' s " , from — , " potter ' s clay " ) is a solid material comprising an inorganic compound of metal , non - metal or metal ##loid atoms primarily held in ionic and co ##valent bonds . [SEP]
[CLS] common examples are earth ##en ##ware , porcelain , and brick . [SEP]
[CLS] the crystal ##lini ##ty of ceramic materials ranges from highly oriented to semi - crystalline , vi ##tri ##fied , and often completely amor ##ph ##ous ( e . g . , glasses ) . [SEP]
[CLS] most often , fired ceramics are either vi ##tri ##fied or semi - vi ##tri ##fied as is the case with earth ##en ##ware , stone ##ware , and porcelain . [SEP]
[CLS] varying crystal ##lini ##ty and electron composition in the ionic and co ##valent bonds cause most ceramic materials to be good thermal and electrical ins ##ulator ##s ( extensively researched in ceramic engineering ) . [SEP]
[CLS] with such a large range of possible options for the composition / structure of a ceramic ( e . g . nearly all of the elements , nearly all types of bonding , and all levels of crystal ##lini ##ty ) , the breadth of the subject is vast , and identifiable attributes ( e . g . hardness , tough ##ness , electrical conduct ##ivity , etc . ) are difficult to specify for the group as a whole . [SEP]
[CLS] general properties such as high melting temperature , high hardness , poor conduct ##ivity , high mod ##uli of elastic ##ity , chemical resistance and low duct ##ility are the norm , with known exceptions to each of these rules ( e . g . pie ##zo ##ele ##ctric ceramics , glass transition temperature , super ##con ##ductive ceramics , etc . ) . [SEP]
[CLS] many composite ##s , such as fiber ##glass and carbon fiber , while containing ceramic materials , are not considered to be part of the ceramic family . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest ceramics made by humans were pottery objects ( i . e . " pots " or " vessels " ) or fig ##uri ##nes made from clay , either by itself or mixed with other materials like si ##lica , hardened and sin ##tered in fire . [SEP]
[CLS] later ceramics were glazed and fired to create smooth , colored surfaces , decreasing por ##osity through the use of glass ##y , amor ##ph ##ous ceramic coating ##s on top of the crystalline ceramic substrates . [SEP]
[CLS] ceramics now include domestic , industrial and building products , as well as a wide range of ceramic art . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 20th century , new ceramic materials were developed for use in advanced ceramic engineering , such as in semiconductor ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " " ceramic " " comes from the greek word , " of pottery " or " for pottery " , from , " potter ' s clay , tile , pottery " . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest known mention of the root " ce ##ram - " is the my ##cen ##aea ##n greek , " workers of ceramics " , written in linear b sy ##lla ##bic script . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " ceramic " may be used as an adjective to describe a material , product or process , or it may be used as a noun , either singular , or , more commonly , as the plural noun " ceramics " . [SEP]
[CLS] a ceramic material is an inorganic , non - metallic , often crystalline oxide , ni ##tri ##de or car ##bid ##e material . [SEP]
[CLS] some elements , such as carbon or silicon , may be considered ceramics . [SEP]
[CLS] ceramic materials are brittle , hard , strong in compression , and weak in shear ##ing and tension . [SEP]
[CLS] they withstand chemical erosion that occurs in other materials subjected to acidic or ca ##ust ##ic environments . [SEP]
[CLS] ceramics generally can withstand very high temperatures , ranging from 1 , 000 °c to 1 , 600 °c ( 1 , 800 °f to 3 , 000 °f ) . [SEP]
[CLS] glass is often not considered a ceramic because of its amor ##ph ##ous ( non ##cr ##yst ##all ##ine ) character . [SEP]
[CLS] however , glass ##making involves several steps of the ceramic process , and its mechanical properties are similar to ceramic materials . [SEP]
[CLS] traditional ceramic raw materials include clay minerals such as ka ##olin ##ite , whereas more recent materials include aluminium oxide , more commonly known as al ##umi ##na . [SEP]
[CLS] the modern ceramic materials , which are classified as advanced ceramics , include silicon car ##bid ##e and tung ##sten car ##bid ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] both are valued for their ab ##ras ##ion resistance and hence find use in applications such as the wear plates of crushing equipment in mining operations . [SEP]
[CLS] advanced ceramics are also used in the medicine , electrical , electronics industries and body armor . [SEP]
[CLS] crystalline ceramic materials are not am ##ena ##ble to a great range of processing . [SEP]
[CLS] methods for dealing with them tend to fall into one of two categories – either make the ceramic in the desired shape , by reaction " in situ " , or by " forming " powder ##s into the desired shape , and then sin ##tering to form a solid body . [SEP]
[CLS] ceramic forming techniques include shaping by hand ( sometimes including a rotation process called " throwing " ) , slip casting , tape casting ( used for making very thin ceramic cap ##ac ##itors ) , injection mold ##ing , dry pressing , and other variations . [SEP]
[CLS] non ##cr ##yst ##all ##ine ceramics , being glass , tend to be formed from melt ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the glass is shaped when either fully molten , by casting , or when in a state of to ##ffe ##e - like vis ##cos ##ity , by methods such as blowing into a mold . [SEP]
[CLS] if later heat treatments cause this glass to become partly crystalline , the resulting material is known as a glass - ceramic , widely used as cook - tops and also as a glass composite material for nuclear waste disposal . [SEP]
[CLS] the physical properties of any ceramic substance are a direct result of its crystalline structure and chemical composition . [SEP]
[CLS] solid - state chemistry reveals the fundamental connection between micro ##st ##ru ##cture and properties such as localized density variations , grain size distribution , type of por ##osity and second - phase content , which can all be correlated with ceramic properties such as mechanical strength σ by the hall - pet ##ch equation , hardness , tough ##ness , die ##le ##ctric constant , and the optical properties exhibited by transparent materials . [SEP]
[CLS] ce ##ram ##ography is the art and science of preparation , examination and evaluation of ceramic micro ##st ##ru ##cture ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] evaluation and characterization of ceramic micro ##st ##ru ##cture ##s is often implemented on similar spatial scales to that used commonly in the emerging field of nano ##tech ##nology : from tens of ang ##strom ##s ( a ) to tens of micro ##meter ##s ( μ ##m ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this is typically somewhere between the minimum wavelength of visible light and the resolution limit of the naked eye . [SEP]
[CLS] the micro ##st ##ru ##cture includes most grains , secondary phases , grain boundaries , por ##es , micro - cracks , structural defects and hardness micro ##ind ##ent ##ions . [SEP]
[CLS] most bulk mechanical , optical , thermal , electrical and magnetic properties are significantly affected by the observed micro ##st ##ru ##cture . [SEP]
[CLS] the fabrication method and process conditions are generally indicated by the micro ##st ##ru ##cture . [SEP]
[CLS] the root cause of many ceramic failures is evident in the cl ##ea ##ved and polished micro ##st ##ru ##cture . [SEP]
[CLS] mechanical properties are important in structural and building materials as well as textile fabrics . [SEP]
[CLS] in modern materials science , fracture mechanics is an important tool in improving the mechanical performance of materials and components . [SEP]
[CLS] it applies the physics of stress and strain , in particular the theories of elastic ##ity and plastic ##ity , to the microscopic crystal ##log ##raphic defects found in real materials in order to predict the macro ##scopic mechanical failure of bodies . [SEP]
[CLS] fra ##ct ##ography is widely used with fracture mechanics to understand the causes of failures and also verify the theoretical failure predictions with real life failures . [SEP]
[CLS] ceramic materials are usually ionic or co ##valent bonded materials , and can be crystalline or amor ##ph ##ous . [SEP]
[CLS] a material held together by either type of bond will tend to fracture before any plastic deformation takes place , which results in poor tough ##ness in these materials . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , because these materials tend to be por ##ous , the por ##es and other microscopic imperfect ##ions act as stress con ##cent ##rator ##s , decreasing the tough ##ness further , and reducing the tens ##ile strength . [SEP]
[CLS] these combine to give catastrophic failures , as opposed to the more duct ##ile failure modes of metals . [SEP]
[CLS] these materials do show plastic deformation . [SEP]
[CLS] however , because of the rigid structure of the crystalline materials , there are very few available slip systems for di ##sl ##ocation ##s to move , and so they def ##or ##m very slowly . [SEP]
[CLS] with the non - crystalline ( glass ##y ) materials , vis ##cous flow is the dominant source of plastic deformation , and is also very slow . [SEP]
[CLS] it is therefore neglected in many applications of ceramic materials . [SEP]
[CLS] to overcome the brittle behaviour , ceramic material development has introduced the class of ceramic matrix composite materials , in which ceramic fibers are embedded and with specific coating ##s are forming fiber bridges across any crack . [SEP]
[CLS] this mechanism substantially increases the fracture tough ##ness of such ceramics . [SEP]
[CLS] ceramic disc brakes are an example of using a ceramic matrix composite material manufactured with a specific process . [SEP]
[CLS] often times if a ceramic will be subjected to substantial mechanical loading it will undergo a process called ice - te ##mp ##lating . [SEP]
[CLS] this process allows the finite control of the micro ##st ##ru ##cture of the ceramic material and therefore the control of the mechanical properties . [SEP]
[CLS] ceramic engineers use this technique to tune the mechanical properties to their desired application . [SEP]
[CLS] specifically , strength is increased when this technique is employed . [SEP]
[CLS] ice te ##mp ##lating allows one to create macro ##scopic por ##es in a un ##idi ##re ##ction ##al arrangement . [SEP]
[CLS] the applications of this oxide strengthening technique are important for solid oxide fuel cells and also water fi ##lt ##ration devices . [SEP]
[CLS] in order to process a sample through ice te ##mp ##lating a few steps are required to be completed by the ceramic ##ist . [SEP]
[CLS] first an a ##que ##ous col ##loid ##al suspension must be prepared containing the dissolved ceramic powder , say y ##tt ##ria stab ##lized z ##ir ##con ##ia ( y ##sz ) . [SEP]
[CLS] after the ceramic precursor is ensured to be evenly dispersed throughout the col ##loid ##al solution then next processing step may begin . [SEP]
[CLS] at this point we have a pure solution containing our y ##sz dissolved powder and a ##que ##ous water in the liquid state . [SEP]
[CLS] the solution is then cooled on a platform that allows for un ##idi ##re ##ction ##al cooling like the one shown in the animation to the right . [SEP]
[CLS] the solution sample of y ##sz is cooled from the bottom to the top in a un ##idi ##re ##ction ##al fashion . [SEP]
[CLS] this forces ice crystals to grow in compliance to the un ##idi ##re ##ction ##al cooling . [SEP]
[CLS] inside the solution , as it is cooling , these ice crystals force the dissolved y ##sz particles to the solid ##ification front of the solid - liquid inter ##pha ##se boundary . [SEP]
[CLS] at this stage of the process we have pure ice crystals lined up in a un ##idi ##re ##ction ##al fashion alongside concentrated pockets of the y ##sz col ##loid ##al particles . [SEP]
[CLS] the next step of the process is the sub ##lim ##ation step . [SEP]
[CLS] the sample is simultaneously heated and the pressure is reduced enough to force to ice crystals to sub ##lim ##inate , since the sample is also heated the y ##sz pockets begin to anne ##al together too form the first macro ##scopic ##ally aligned ceramic micro ##st ##uc ##tures . [SEP]
[CLS] the sample is then further sin ##tered to confirm the eva ##por ##ation of the residual water and the final consolidation of the ceramic micro ##st ##ru ##cture . [SEP]
[CLS] during the execution of this technique a few variables can be controlled to influence the por ##e size and morphology of the micro ##st ##ru ##cture . [SEP]
[CLS] these important variables of the ice - te ##mp ##lating technique are namely the initial solids loading of the col ##loid , the cooling rate , the sin ##tering temperature and time length , and also it has been shown that certain additive ##s can influence the micro - structural morphology during this process . [SEP]
[CLS] a good understanding of these parameters is essential to understanding the relationships between processing , micro ##st ##ru ##cture , and mechanical properties of an ##iso ##tropical ##ly por ##ous materials . [SEP]
[CLS] some ceramics are semiconductor ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] most of these are transition metal oxide ##s that are ii - vi semiconductor ##s , such as zinc oxide . [SEP]
[CLS] while there are prospects of mass - producing blue led ##s from zinc oxide , ceramic ##ists are most interested in the electrical properties that show grain boundary effects . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the most widely used of these is the var ##isto ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] these are devices that exhibit the property that resistance drops sharply at a certain threshold voltage . [SEP]
[CLS] once the voltage across the device reaches the threshold , there is a breakdown of the electrical structure in the vicinity of the grain boundaries , which results in its electrical resistance dropping from several meg ##oh ##ms down to a few hundred oh ##ms . [SEP]
[CLS] the major advantage of these is that they can di ##ssi ##pate a lot of energy , and they self - reset – after the voltage across the device drops below the threshold , its resistance returns to being high . [SEP]
[CLS] this makes them ideal for surge - protection applications ; as there is control over the threshold voltage and energy tolerance , they find use in all sorts of applications . [SEP]
[CLS] the best demonstration of their ability can be found in electrical sub ##station ##s , where they are employed to protect the infrastructure from lightning strikes . [SEP]
[CLS] they have rapid response , are low maintenance , and do not app ##re ##cia ##bly de ##grade from use , making them virtually ideal devices for this application . [SEP]
[CLS] semi ##con ##du ##cting ceramics are also employed as gas sensors . [SEP]
[CLS] when various gases are passed over a poly ##cr ##yst ##all ##ine ceramic , its electrical resistance changes . [SEP]
[CLS] with tuning to the possible gas mixture ##s , very inexpensive devices can be produced . [SEP]
[CLS] under some conditions , such as extremely low temperature , some ceramics exhibit high - temperature super ##con ##du ##ct ##ivity . [SEP]
[CLS] the reason for this is not understood , but there are two major families of super ##con ##du ##cting ceramics . [SEP]
[CLS] pie ##zo ##ele ##ctric ##ity , a link between electrical and mechanical response , is exhibited by a large number of ceramic materials , including the quartz used to measure time in watches and other electronics . [SEP]
[CLS] such devices use both properties of pie ##zo ##ele ##ctric ##s , using electricity to produce a mechanical motion ( power ##ing the device ) and then using this mechanical motion to produce electricity ( generating a signal ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the unit of time measured is the natural interval required for electricity to be converted into mechanical energy and back again . [SEP]
[CLS] the pie ##zo ##ele ##ctric effect is generally stronger in materials that also exhibit p ##yr ##oe ##le ##ctric ##ity , and all p ##yr ##oe ##le ##ctric materials are also pie ##zo ##ele ##ctric . [SEP]
[CLS] these materials can be used to inter convert between thermal , mechanical , or electrical energy ; for instance , after synthesis in a furnace , a p ##yr ##oe ##le ##ctric crystal allowed to cool under no applied stress generally builds up a static charge of thousands of vol ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] such materials are used in motion sensors , where the tiny rise in temperature from a warm body entering the room is enough to produce a me ##asurable voltage in the crystal . [SEP]
[CLS] in turn , p ##yr ##oe ##le ##ctric ##ity is seen most strongly in materials which also display the fe ##rro ##ele ##ctric effect , in which a stable electric dip ##ole can be oriented or reversed by applying an electro ##static field . [SEP]
[CLS] p ##yr ##oe ##le ##ctric ##ity is also a necessary consequence of fe ##rro ##ele ##ctric ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] this can be used to store information in fe ##rro ##ele ##ctric cap ##ac ##itors , elements of fe ##rro ##ele ##ctric ram . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common such materials are lead z ##ir ##cona ##te titan ##ate and bari ##um titan ##ate . [SEP]
[CLS] aside from the uses mentioned above , their strong pie ##zo ##ele ##ctric response is exploited in the design of high - frequency loud ##sp ##eak ##ers , trans ##du ##cer ##s for sonar , and act ##ua ##tors for atomic force and scanning tunnel ##ing microscope ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] increases in temperature can cause grain boundaries to suddenly become ins ##ulating in some semi ##con ##du ##cting ceramic materials , mostly mixture ##s of heavy metal titan ##ates . [SEP]
[CLS] the critical transition temperature can be adjusted over a wide range by variations in chemistry . [SEP]
[CLS] in such materials , current will pass through the material until jo ##ule heating brings it to the transition temperature , at which point the circuit will be broken and current flow will cease . [SEP]
[CLS] such ceramics are used as self - controlled heating elements in , for example , the rear - window def ##ros ##t circuits of automobiles . [SEP]
[CLS] at the transition temperature , the material ' s die ##le ##ctric response becomes theoretically infinite . [SEP]
[CLS] while a lack of temperature control would rule out any practical use of the material near its critical temperature , the die ##le ##ctric effect remains exceptionally strong even at much higher temperatures . [SEP]
[CLS] titan ##ates with critical temperatures far below room temperature have become synonymous with " ceramic " in the context of ceramic cap ##ac ##itors for just this reason . [SEP]
[CLS] optical ##ly transparent materials focus on the response of a material to incoming light ##wave ##s of a range of wavelengths . [SEP]
[CLS] frequency selective optical filters can be utilized to alter or enhance the brightness and contrast of a digital image . [SEP]
[CLS] guided light ##wave transmission via frequency selective wave ##guide ##s involves the emerging field of fiber optics and the ability of certain glass ##y compositions as a transmission medium for a range of frequencies simultaneously ( multi - mode optical fiber ) with little or no interference between competing wavelengths or frequencies . [SEP]
[CLS] this res ##ona ##nt mode of energy and data transmission via electromagnetic ( light ) wave propagation , though low powered , is virtually loss ##less . [SEP]
[CLS] optical wave ##guide ##s are used as components in integrated optical circuits ( e . g . light - emi ##tting di ##odes , led ##s ) or as the transmission medium in local and long haul optical communication systems . [SEP]
[CLS] also of value to the emerging materials scientist is the sensitivity of materials to radiation in the thermal infrared ( ir ) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum . [SEP]
[CLS] this heat - seeking ability is responsible for such diverse optical phenomena as night - vision and ir lu ##mine ##sc ##ence . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , there is an increasing need in the military sector for high - strength , robust materials which have the capability to transmit light ( electromagnetic waves ) in the visible ( 0 . 4 – 0 . 7 micro ##meter ##s ) and mid - infrared ( 1 – 5 micro ##meter ##s ) regions of the spectrum . [SEP]
[CLS] these materials are needed for applications requiring transparent armor , including next - generation high - speed missiles and pods , as well as protection against improvised explosive devices ( ie ##d ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1960s , scientists at general electric ( ge ) discovered that under the right manufacturing conditions , some ceramics , especially aluminium oxide ( al ##umi ##na ) , could be made translucent . [SEP]
[CLS] these translucent materials were transparent enough to be used for containing the electrical plasma generated in high - pressure sodium street lamps . [SEP]
[CLS] during the past two decades , additional types of transparent ceramics have been developed for applications such as nose cones for heat - seeking missiles , windows for fighter aircraft , and sci ##nti ##llation counters for computed tom ##ography scanner ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 1970s , thomas soul ##es pioneered computer modeling of light transmission through translucent ceramic al ##umi ##na . [SEP]
[CLS] his model showed that microscopic por ##es in ceramic , mainly trapped at the junctions of micro ##cr ##yst ##all ##ine grains , caused light to sc ##atter and prevented true transparency . [SEP]
[CLS] the volume fraction of these microscopic por ##es had to be less than 1 % for high - quality optical transmission . [SEP]
[CLS] this is basically a particle size effect . [SEP]
[CLS] op ##ac ##ity results from the inc ##oh ##ere ##nt scattering of light at surfaces and interfaces . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to por ##es , most of the interfaces in a typical metal or ceramic object are in the form of grain boundaries which separate tiny regions of crystalline order . [SEP]
[CLS] when the size of the scattering center ( or grain boundary ) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered , the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent . [SEP]
[CLS] in the formation of poly ##cr ##yst ##all ##ine materials ( metals and ceramics ) the size of the crystalline grains is determined largely by the size of the crystalline particles present in the raw material during formation ( or pressing ) of the object . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , the size of the grain boundaries scales directly with particle size . [SEP]
[CLS] thus a reduction of the original particle size below the wavelength of visible light ( ~ 0 . 5 micro ##meter ##s for short ##wave violet ) eliminate ##s any light scattering , resulting in a transparent material . [SEP]
[CLS] recently , japanese scientists have developed techniques to produce ceramic parts that rival the transparency of traditional crystals ( grown from a single seed ) and exceed the fracture tough ##ness of a single crystal . [SEP]
[CLS] in particular , scientists at the japanese firm ko ##nos ##hima ltd . , a producer of ceramic construction materials and industrial chemicals , have been looking for markets for their transparent ceramics . [SEP]
[CLS] liver ##more researchers realized that these ceramics might greatly benefit high - powered lasers used in the national ignition facility ( ni ##f ) programs directorate . [SEP]
[CLS] in particular , a liver ##more research team began to acquire advanced transparent ceramics from ko ##nos ##hima to determine if they could meet the optical requirements needed for liver ##more ’ s solid - state heat capacity laser ( ss ##hc ##l ) . [SEP]
[CLS] liver ##more researchers have also been testing applications of these materials for applications such as advanced drivers for laser - driven fusion power plants . [SEP]
[CLS] a composite material of ceramic and metal is known as ce ##rm ##et . [SEP]
[CLS] frequently , the raw materials of modern ceramics do not include clay ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] each one of these classes can be developed into unique material properties because ceramics tend to be crystalline . [SEP]
[CLS] ceramic artifacts have an important role in archaeology for understanding the culture , technology and behavior of peoples of the past . [SEP]
[CLS] they are among the most common artifacts to be found at an archaeological site , generally in the form of small fragments of broken pottery called she ##rds . [SEP]
[CLS] processing of collected she ##rds can be consistent with two main types of analysis : technical and traditional . [SEP]
[CLS] traditional analysis involves sorting ceramic artifacts , she ##rds and larger fragments into specific types based on style , composition , manufacturing and morphology . [SEP]
[CLS] by creating these ty ##pol ##og ##ies it is possible to distinguish between different cultural styles , the purpose of the ceramic and technological state of the people among other conclusions . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , by looking at stylistic changes of ceramics over time is it possible to separate ( ser ##iate ) the ceramics into distinct diagnostic groups ( ass ##em ##bla ##ges ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a comparison of ceramic artifacts with known dated ass ##em ##bla ##ges allows for a chronological assignment of these pieces . [SEP]
[CLS] the technical approach to ceramic analysis involves a finer examination of the composition of ceramic artifacts and she ##rds to determine the source of the material and through this the possible manufacturing site . [SEP]
[CLS] key criteria are the composition of the clay and the temper used in the manufacture of the article under study : temper is a material added to the clay during the initial production stage , and it is used to aid the subsequent drying process . [SEP]
[CLS] types of temper include shell pieces , granite fragments and ground she ##rd pieces called ' gr ##og ' . [SEP]
[CLS] temper is usually identified by microscopic examination of the temper material . [SEP]
[CLS] clay identification is determined by a process of ref ##iring the ceramic , and assign ##ing a color to it using mu ##nse ##ll soil color notation . [SEP]
[CLS] by est ##imating both the clay and temper compositions , and locating a region where both are known to occur , an assignment of the material source can be made . [SEP]
[CLS] from the source assignment of the artifact further investigations can be made into the site of manufacture . [SEP]
