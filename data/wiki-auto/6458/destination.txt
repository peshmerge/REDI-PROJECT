Ceramic is the name for some materials that are formed by the use of heat.
The word "ceramic" comes from the Greek word ("").
Chemically, it is an inorganic compound of metal, non-metal or metalloid atoms held together by chemical bonds.
Up to the 1950s or so, the most important were the traditional clays, made into pottery, bricks, tiles and the like, also cements and glass.
Clay-based ceramics are described in the article on pottery.
A composite material of ceramic and metal is known as cermet.
The word "ceramic" can be an adjective, and can also be used as a noun to refer to a ceramic material, or a product of ceramic manufacture.
"Ceramics" may also be used as a singular noun referring to the art of making things out of ceramic materials.
The technology of manufacturing and usage of ceramic materials is part of the field of ceramic engineering.
Many clay-based ceramic materials are hard, porous, and brittle.
The study and development of ceramics includes methods to deal with these characteristics, to accentuate the strengths of the materials and investigate novel applications.
Each one of these classes can develop unique material properties.
Ceramic materials are usually ionic or covalent bonded materials, and can be crystalline or amorphous.
A material held together by either type of bond will tend to fracture (break) before any plastic deformation takes place, which results in poor toughness in these materials.
Additionally, because these materials tend to have a lot of pores, the pores and other microscopic imperfections act as stress concentrators, decreasing the toughness further, and reducing the tensile strength.
These combine to give catastrophic failures, as opposed to the normally much more gentle failure modes of metals.
These materials do show plastic deformation.
However, due to the stiff structure of the crystalline materials, there are very few available slip systems for dislocations to move, and so they deform very slowly.
With the non-crystalline (glassy) materials, viscous flow is the main source of plastic deformation, and is also very slow.
Because of that, it is ignored in many applications of ceramic materials.
There are a number of ceramics that are semiconductors.
Most of these are transition metal oxides that are II-VI semiconductors, such as zinc oxide.
While there is talk of making blue LEDs from zinc oxide, ceramicists are most interested in the electrical properties that show grain boundary effects.
One of the most widely used of these is the varistor.
Semiconducting ceramics are also employed as gas sensors.
When various gases are passed over a polycrystalline ceramic, its electrical resistance changes.
With tuning to the possible gas mixtures, very cheap devices can be produced.
Under some conditions, such as extremely low temperature, some ceramics show superconductivity.
The exact reason for this is not known, but there are two major families of superconducting ceramics .
Piezoelectricity, a link between electrical and mechanical response, is exhibited by a large number of ceramic materials, including the quartz used to measure time in watches and other electronics.
Such devices turn electricity to mechanical motions and back, making a stable oscillator.
The piezoelectric effect is generally stronger in materials that also show pyroelectricity, and all pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric.
These materials can be used to inter convert between thermal, mechanical, and/or electrical energy; for instance, after synthesis in a furnace, a pyroelectric crystal allowed to cool under no applied stress generally builds up a static charge of thousands of volts.
Such materials are used in motion sensors, where the tiny rise in temperature from a warm body entering the room is enough to produce a measurable voltage in the crystal.
In turn, pyroelectricity is seen most strongly in materials which also display the ferroelectric effect, in which a stable electric dipole can be oriented or reversed by applying an electrostatic field.
Pyroelectricity is also a necessary consequence of ferroelectricity.
This can be used to store information in ferroelectric capacitors, elements of ferroelectric RAM.
The most common such materials are lead zirconate titanate and barium titanate.
Aside from the uses mentioned above, their strong piezoelectric response is exploited in the design of high-frequency loudspeakers, transducers for sonar, and actuators for atomic force and scanning tunneling microscopes.
Increases in temperature can cause grain boundaries to suddenly become insulating in some semiconducting ceramic materials, mostly mixtures of heavy metal titanates.
The critical transition temperature can be adjusted over a wide range by variations in chemistry.
In such materials, current will pass through the material until joule heating brings it to the transition temperature, at which point the circuit will be broken and current flow will cease.
Such ceramics are used as self-controlled heating elements in, for example, the rear-window defrost circuits of automobiles.
At the transition temperature, the material's dielectric response becomes theoretically infinite.
While a lack of temperature control would rule out any practical use of the material near its critical temperature, the dielectric effect remains exceptionally strong even at much higher temperatures.
Titanates with critical temperatures far below room temperature have become synonymous with "ceramic" in the context of ceramic capacitors for just this reason.
Non-crystalline ceramics: Non-crystalline ceramics, being glasses, tend to be formed from melts.
The glass is shaped when either fully molten, by casting, or when in a state of toffee-like viscosity, by methods such as blowing to a mold.
If later heat-treatments cause this class to become partly crystalline, the resulting material is known as a glass-ceramic.
Crystalline ceramics: Crystalline ceramic materials are not amenable to a great range of processing.
Methods for dealing with them tend to fall into one of two categories – either make the ceramic in the desired shape, by reaction in situ, or by "forming" powders into the desired shape, and then sintering to form a solid body.
Ceramic forming techniques include shaping by hand (sometimes including a rotation process called "throwing"), slip casting, tape casting (used for making very thin ceramic capacitors, etc.), injection molding, dry pressing, and other variations.
(See also Ceramic forming techniques.
Details of these processes are described in the two books listed below.)
A few methods use a hybrid between the two approaches.
The most common use of this method is in the production of cement and concrete.
Here, the dehydrated powders are mixed with water.
This starts hydration reactions, which result in long, interlocking crystals forming around the aggregates.
Over time, these result in a solid ceramic.
The biggest problem with this method is that most reactions are so fast that good mixing is not possible, which tends to prevent large-scale construction.
However, small-scale systems can be made by deposition techniques, where the various materials are introduced above a substrate, and react and form the ceramic on the substrate.
This borrows techniques from the semiconductor industry, such as chemical vapour deposition, and is very useful for coatings.
These tend to produce very dense ceramics, but do so slowly.
The principles of sintering-based methods is simple.
Once a roughly held together object (called a "green body") is made, it is baked in a kiln, where diffusion processes cause the green body to shrink.
The pores in the object close up, resulting in a denser, stronger product.
The firing is done at a temperature below the melting point of the ceramic.
There is virtually always some porosity left, but the real advantage of this method is that the green body can be produced in any way imaginable, and still be sintered.
This makes it a very versatile route.
There are thousands of possible refinements of this process.
Some of the most common involve pressing the green body to give the densification a head start and reduce the sintering time needed.
Sometimes organic binders such as polyvinyl alcohol are added to hold the green body together; these burn out during the firing (at 200–350 °C).
Sometimes organic lubricants are added during pressing to increase densification.
It is not uncommon to combine these, and add binders and lubricants to a powder, then press.
(The formulation of these organic chemical additives is an art in itself.
This is particularly important in the manufacture of high performance ceramics such as those used by the billions for electronics, in capacitors, inductors, sensors, etc.
The specialized formulations most commonly used in electronics are detailed in the book "Tape Casting," by R.E. Mistler, et al., Amer.
A comprehensive book on the subject, for mechanical as well as electronics applications, is "Organic Additives and Ceramic Processing," by D. J. Shanefield, Kluwer Publishers Boston, 1996.
A slurry can be used in place of a powder, and then cast into a desired shape, dried and then sintered.
Indeed, traditional pottery is done with this type of method, using a plastic mixture worked with the hands.
If a mixture of different materials is used together in a ceramic, the sintering temperature is sometimes above the melting point of one minor component – a "liquid phase" sintering.
This results in shorter sintering times compared to solid state sintering.
