[CLS] the kingdom was centred on the valley of the river trent and its tributaries , in the region now known as the english midlands . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the anglo - saxon chronicle , it was from rep ##ton in 87 ##3 - 4 that the great heath ##en army deposed the king of mer ##cia . [SEP]
[CLS] for 300 years ( between 600 and 900 ) , having annexed or gained submissions from five of the other six kingdoms of the he ##pta ##rchy ( east anglia , essex , kent , sussex and wessex ) , mer ##cia dominated england south of the river hum ##ber : this period is known as the mer ##cian supremacy . [SEP]
[CLS] the reign of king off ##a , who is best remembered for his dyke that designated the boundary between mer ##cia and the welsh kingdoms , is sometimes known as the " golden age of mer ##cia " . [SEP]
[CLS] nicholas brooks noted that " the mer ##cian ##s stand out as by far the most successful of the various early anglo - saxon peoples until the later ninth century " , and some historians , such as sir frank ste ##nton , believe the unification of england south of the hum ##ber estuary was achieved during the reign of off ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] mer ##cia was a pagan kingdom ; king pea ##da converted to christianity around 65 ##6 , and christianity was firmly established in the kingdom by the late 7th century . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of the 9th century , following the invasions of the vikings and their great heath ##en army , much of the former mer ##cian territory was absorbed into the dane ##law . [SEP]
[CLS] the final mer ##cian king , ceo ##l ##wu ##lf ii , died in 87 ##9 ; the kingdom appears to have thereby lost its political independence . [SEP]
[CLS] the kingdom had a brief period of independence in the mid - 10th century , and again very briefly in 1016 ; however , by this time , it was viewed as a province within the kingdom of england , not an independent kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] mer ##cia ' s exact evolution at the start of the anglo - saxon era remains more obscure than that of north ##umb ##ria , kent , or even wessex . [SEP]
[CLS] the name " mer ##cia " is old english for " boundary folk " ( see welsh marches ) , and the traditional interpretation is that the kingdom originated along the frontier between the native welsh and the anglo - saxon invaders . [SEP]
[CLS] the earliest person named in any records as a king of mer ##cia is cr ##eo ##da , said to have been the great - grandson of ice ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] coming to power around 58 ##4 , he built a fortress at tam ##worth which became the seat of mer ##cia ' s kings . [SEP]
[CLS] ce ##ar ##l , a kin ##sman of cr ##eo ##da , followed p ##y ##bba in 60 ##6 ; in 61 ##5 , ce ##ar ##l gave his daughter cw ##enburg ##a in marriage to edwin , king of dei ##ra , whom he had sheltered while he was an exiled prince . [SEP]
[CLS] however , bed ##e admits that pen ##da freely allowed christian missionaries from lin ##dis ##far ##ne into mer ##cia , and did not restrain them from preaching . [SEP]
[CLS] in 63 ##3 pen ##da and his ally cad ##wall ##on of g ##wyn ##edd defeated and killed edwin , who had become not only ruler of the newly unified north ##umb ##ria , but bret ##wald ##a , or high king , over the southern kingdoms . [SEP]
[CLS] when another north ##umb ##rian king , oswald , arose and again claimed over ##lord ##ship of the south , he also suffered defeat and death at the hands of pen ##da and his allies – in 64 ##2 at the battle of mas ##er ##field . [SEP]
[CLS] pen ##da ' s son pea ##da , who had converted to christianity at rep ##ton in 65 ##3 , succeeded his father as king of mer ##cia ; os ##wi ##u set up pea ##da as an under - king ; but in the spring of 65 ##6 he was murdered and os ##wi ##u assumed direct control of the whole of mer ##cia . [SEP]
[CLS] a mer ##cian revolt in 65 ##8 threw off north ##umb ##rian domination and resulted in the appearance of another son of pen ##da , wu ##lf ##her ##e , who ruled mer ##cia as an independent kingdom ( though he apparently continued to render tribute to north ##umb ##ria for a while ) until his death in 67 ##5 . [SEP]
[CLS] wu ##lf ##her ##e initially succeeded in restoring the power of mer ##cia , but the end of his reign saw a serious defeat by north ##umb ##ria . [SEP]
[CLS] the next king , æ ##the ##lr ##ed , defeated north ##umb ##ria in the battle of the trent in 67 ##9 , settling once and for all the long - disputed control of the former kingdom of lindsey . [SEP]
[CLS] æ ##the ##lr ##ed was succeeded by c ##œ ##nr ##ed , son of wu ##lf ##her ##e ; both these kings became better known for their religious activities than anything else , but the king who succeeded them in 70 ##9 , ceo ##lr ##ed , is said in a letter of saint bon ##iface to have been a di ##sso ##lu ##te youth who died insane . [SEP]
[CLS] at some point before the accession of æ ##the ##lb ##ald in 71 ##6 the mer ##cian ##s conquered the region around wr ##ox ##eter , known to the welsh as peng ##wer ##n or as " the paradise of pow ##ys " . [SEP]
[CLS] but when wi ##ht ##red died in 72 ##5 , and in ##e abd ##icated in 72 ##6 to become a monk in rome , æ ##the ##lb ##ald was free to establish mer ##cia ' s he ##ge ##mony over the rest of the anglo - saxons south of the hum ##ber . [SEP]
[CLS] whether the ho ##ard was deposited by anglo - saxon pagan ##s or christians remains unclear , as does the purpose of the deposit . [SEP]
[CLS] off ##a ( reigned 75 ##7 to 79 ##6 ) had to build an ##ew the he ##ge ##mony which his predecessor had exercised over the southern english , and he did this so successfully that he became the greatest king mer ##cia had ever known . [SEP]
[CLS] not only did he win battles and dominate southern england , but also he took an active hand in administering the affairs of his kingdom , founding market towns and overseeing the first major issues of gold coins in britain ; he assumed a role in the administration of the catholic church in england ( sponsoring the short - lived archbishop ##ric of li ##chfield , 78 ##7 to 79 ##9 ) , and even negotiated with charlemagne as an equal . [SEP]
[CLS] off ##a ex ##erted himself to ensure that his son ec ##gf ##rith of mer ##cia would succeed him , but after off ##a ' s death in july 79 ##6 ec ##gf ##rith survived for only five months , and the kingdom passed to a distant relative named coe ##n ##wu ##lf in december 79 ##6 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 82 ##1 coe ##n ##wu ##lf ' s brother ceo ##l ##wu ##lf succeeded to the mer ##cian kings ##hip ; he demonstrated his military prowess by his attack on and destruction of the fortress of de ##gan ##wy in g ##wyn ##edd . [SEP]
[CLS] the power of the west saxons under e ##gb ##ert ( king of wessex from 802 to 83 ##9 ) grew during this period , however , and in 82 ##5 e ##gb ##ert defeated the mer ##cian king be ##orn ##wu ##lf ( who had overthrow ##n ceo ##l ##wu ##lf in 82 ##3 ) at ellen ##dun . [SEP]
[CLS] be ##orn ##wu ##lf was slain while suppress ##ing a revolt amongst the east angles , and his successor , a former ea ##ld ##or ##man named lu ##de ##ca ( reigned 82 ##6 - 82 ##7 ) , met the same fate . [SEP]
[CLS] in 83 ##0 wig ##la ##f regained independence for mer ##cia , but by this time wessex had clearly become the dominant power in england . [SEP]
[CLS] the danes drove bu ##rg ##red from his kingdom in 87 ##4 and ceo ##l ##wu ##lf ii took his place . [SEP]
[CLS] in 87 ##7 the danes seized the eastern part of mer ##cia , which became part of the dane ##law . [SEP]
[CLS] all coins struck in mer ##cia after the disappearance of ceo ##l ##wu ##lf in c . 87 ##9 were in the name of the west saxon king . [SEP]
[CLS] æ ##the ##lr ##ed had married æ ##the ##lf ##l ##æ ##d , daughter of alfred the great of wessex , and she assumed power when her husband became ill at some time in the last ten years of his life . [SEP]
[CLS] she and her brother continued alfred ' s policy of building fortified bu ##rh ##s , and in 91 ##7 - 18 they were able to conquer the southern dane ##law in east anglia and danish mer ##cia . [SEP]
[CLS] when æ ##the ##lf ##l ##æ ##d died in 91 ##8 , æ ##lf ##wyn ##n , her daughter by æ ##the ##lr ##ed , succeeded as ' second lady of the mer ##cian ##s ' , but within six months edward had deprived her of all authority in mer ##cia and taken her into wessex . [SEP]
[CLS] æ ##the ##ls ##tan himself was raised in mer ##cia and became its king before he was king of wessex . [SEP]
[CLS] in winchester , there was even an attempt to blind æ ##the ##ls ##tan as he was seen as an outsider . [SEP]
[CLS] in 97 ##5 , king edgar is described as “ friend of the west saxons and protector of the mer ##cian ##s ” . [SEP]
[CLS] a separate political existence from wessex was briefly restored in 95 ##5 – 95 ##9 , when edgar became king of mer ##cia , and again in 1016 , when the kingdom was divided between cn ##ut and edmund iron ##side , cn ##ut taking mer ##cia . [SEP]
[CLS] the last reference to mer ##cia by name is in the anna ##l for 101 ##7 , when ea ##dr ##ic st ##re ##ona was awarded the government of mer ##cia by cn ##ut . [SEP]
[CLS] the later earls , leo ##fr ##ic , æ ##lf ##gar and edwin , ruled over a territory broadly corresponding to historic mer ##cia , but the chronicle does not identify it by name . [SEP]
[CLS] j . r . r . tolkien is one of many scholars who have studied and promoted the mer ##cian dialect of old english , and introduced various mer ##cian terms into his legend ##arium – especially in relation to the kingdom of rohan , otherwise known as the " mark " ( a name co ##gna ##te with " mer ##cia " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] not only is the language of rohan actually represented as the mer ##cian dialect of old english , but a number of its kings are given the same names as monarchs who appear in the mer ##cian royal genealogy , e . g . , fr ##ea ##wine , fr ##eal ##af and e ##ome ##r ( see list of kings of the angles ) . [SEP]
[CLS] mer ##cian rulers remained res ##ol ##ute ##ly pagan until the reign of pea ##da in 65 ##6 , although this did not prevent them joining coalition ##s with christian welsh rulers to resist north ##umb ##ria . [SEP]
[CLS] the first appearance of christianity in mer ##cia , however , had come at least thirty years earlier , following the battle of ci ##rence ##ster of 62 ##8 , when pen ##da incorporated the formerly west saxon territories of h ##wi ##cc ##e into his kingdom . [SEP]
[CLS] the conversion of mer ##cia to christianity occurred in the latter part of the 7th century , and by the time of pen ##da ' s defeat and death , mer ##cia was largely surrounded by christian states . [SEP]
[CLS] christianity finally gained a foot ##hold in mer ##cia when os ##wi ##u supported pea ##da as sub - king of the middle angles , requiring him to marry os ##wi ##u ' s daughter , al ##ch ##fl ##ae ##d , and to accept her religion . [SEP]
[CLS] for knowledge of the internal composition of the kingdom of mer ##cia , we must rely on a document of uncertain age ( possibly late 7th century ) , known as the " tribal hid ##age " – an assessment of the extent ( but not the location ) of land owned ( reckon ##ed in hides ) , and therefore the military obligations and perhaps taxes due , by each of the mer ##cian tribes and subject kingdoms by name . [SEP]
[CLS] this hid ##age exists in several manuscript versions , some as late as the 14th century . [SEP]
[CLS] it lists a number of peoples , such as the h ##wi ##cc ##e , who have now vanished , except for reminder ##s in various place ##name ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] after mer ##cia was annexed by wessex in the early 10th century , the west saxon rulers divided it into shire ##s modelled after their own system , cutting across traditional mer ##cian divisions . [SEP]
[CLS] the most credible source for the idea of a contemporary mer ##cia is thomas hardy ' s wessex novels . [SEP]
[CLS] the first of these appeared in 1874 and hardy himself considered it the origin of the con ##ce ##it of a contemporary wessex . [SEP]
[CLS] bram stoke ##r set his 1911 novel " the lair of the white worm " in a contemporary mer ##cia that may have been influenced by hardy , whose secretary was a friend of stoke ##r ' s brother . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1908 sir oliver lodge , principal of birmingham university , wrote to his counterpart at bristol , welcoming a new university worthy of " . . . the great province of wessex whose higher educational needs it will supply . [SEP]
[CLS] at this period , prior to the first world war , regional identities within england were being debated with the prospect of separate home rule parliament ##s being established . [SEP]
[CLS] the british army has made use of several regional identities in naming larger , amalgamated formations . [SEP]
[CLS] today , " mer ##cia " appears in the titles of two regiments , the mer ##cian regiment , founded in 2007 , which recruits in cheshire , derbyshire , nottinghamshire , worcestershire , and parts of greater manchester and the west midlands , and the royal mer ##cian and lan ##cast ##rian yeomanry , founded in 1992 as part of the territorial army . [SEP]
[CLS] telephone director ##ies across the midlands include a large number of commercial and voluntary organisations using " mer ##cia " in their names , and in 2012 a new football league was formed called the mer ##cian regional football league . [SEP]
[CLS] the acting wit ##an of mer ##cia , previously known as the mer ##cian constitutional convention , is a radical political organisation that claims to be the legal government of mer ##cia , having declared independence from the united kingdom on 29 may 2003 in victoria square , birmingham . [SEP]
[CLS] the salt ##ire as a symbol of mer ##cia may have been in use since the time of king off ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] with the dissolution of the abbey and the incorporation of the borough of st albans the device was used on the town ' s corporate seal and was officially recorded as the arms of the town at an heraldic visitation in 1634 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was also flown outside birmingham council house during 2009 while the staffordshire ho ##ard was on display in the city before being taken to the british museum in london . [SEP]
[CLS] the cross has been incorporated into a number of coats of arms of mer ##cian towns , including tam ##worth , lee ##k and b ##lab ##y . [SEP]
[CLS] the silver double - headed eagle sur ##mounted by a golden three - pro ##nged saxon crown has been used by several units of the british army as a heraldic device for mer ##cia since 1958 , including the mer ##cian regiment . [SEP]
[CLS] it is worth noting , however , that leo ##fr ##ic is sometimes attributed a black , single - headed eagle instead . [SEP]
[CLS] the w ##y ##vern , a type of dragon , came to have a strong association with mer ##cia in the 19th century . [SEP]
[CLS] the midland railway , which used a white ( silver ) w ##y ##vern " sans legs " ( leg ##less ) as its crest , having inherited it from the leicester and swan ##nington railway , asserted that the " w ##y ##vern was the standard of the kingdom of mer ##cia " , and that it was " a quarter ##ing in the town arms of leicester " . [SEP]
[CLS] the symbol appeared on numerous stations and other company buildings in the region , and was worn as a silver badge by all uniformed employees . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in 1897 the " railway magazine " noted that there appeared " to be no foundation that the w ##y ##vern was associated with the kingdom of mer ##cia " . [SEP]
[CLS] it has been associated with leicester since the time of thomas , 2nd earl of lancaster and leicester ( c . 127 ##8 – 132 ##2 ) , the most powerful lord in the midlands , who used it as his personal crest , and was recorded in a heraldic visitation of the town in 161 ##9 . [SEP]
[CLS] in bram stoke ##r ' s 1911 novel " the lair of the white worm " , explicitly set in mer ##cia ( see above ) , the mer ##cian white w ##y ##vern " sans legs " of the midland railway was transformed into a monstrous beast , the eponymous worm of the title . [SEP]
[CLS] today , the white w ##yr ##m of mer ##cia is recognised as the mer ##cian flag by the acting wit ##an of mer ##cia . [SEP]
[CLS] the ultimate source for the symbolism of white dragons in england would appear to be geoffrey of monmouth ’ s fictional work , " the history of the kings of britain " ( c . 113 ##6 ) , which recounts an incident in the life of merlin where a red dragon is seen fighting a white dragon and prevailing . [SEP]
[CLS] the red dragon was taken to represent the welsh and their eventual victory over the anglo - saxon invaders , symbol ##ised by the white dragon . [SEP]
[CLS] with more restricted boundaries than the kingdom of mer ##cia at its greatest extent , and also of the area traditionally known as the midlands , two regions of england ( formerly government office regions ) together represent the latter : west midlands and east midlands . [SEP]
[CLS] the unitary authorities of north lincolnshire and north east lincolnshire ( not shown ) , while classed as part of the ceremonial county of lincolnshire , actually come under the yorkshire and the hum ##ber region and are therefore not in the officially recognised east midlands region .
