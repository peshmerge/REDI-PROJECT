[CLS] w ##his ##t is a classic english trick - taking card game which was widely played in the 18th and 19th centuries . [SEP]
[CLS] although the rules are simple , there is scope for scientific play . [SEP]
[CLS] w ##his ##t is a descendant of the 16th - century game of " trump " or " ru ##ff " . [SEP]
[CLS] w ##his ##t replaced the popular variant of " trump " known as ru ##ff and honours . [SEP]
[CLS] the game takes its name from the 17th century " w ##his ##t " ( or " wi ##st " ) meaning " quiet " , " silent " , " at ##ten ##tive " , which is the root of the modern " wi ##st ##ful " . [SEP]
[CLS] according to dai ##nes barrington , w ##his ##t was first played on scientific principles by a party of gentlemen who frequented the crown coffee house in bedford row , london , around 1728 . [SEP]
[CLS] edmond ho ##yle , suspected to be a member of this group , began to tutor wealthy young gentlemen in the game and published " a short treatise on the game of w ##his ##t " in 1742 . [SEP]
[CLS] it became the standard text and rules for the game for the next hundred years . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1862 henry jones , writing under the pseudonym " cavendish " , published " the principles of w ##his ##t stated and explained , and its practice illustrated on an original system , by means of hands played completely through " , which became the standard text . [SEP]
[CLS] many subsequent editions and en ##lar ##gement ##s of this work were published using the simpler title " cavendish on w ##his ##t " . [SEP]
[CLS] by this time w ##his ##t was governed by elaborate and rigid rules covering the laws of the game , et ##ique ##tte and play which took time to study and master . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1890s , a variant known as bridge w ##his ##t became popular which eventually evolved into contract bridge . [SEP]
[CLS] the traditional game of w ##his ##t survives at social events called " w ##his ##t drives " . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many modern variants of w ##his ##t played for fun . [SEP]
[CLS] a standard 52 - card pack is used . [SEP]
[CLS] the cards in each suit rank from highest to lowest : a k q j 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 . [SEP]
[CLS] w ##his ##t is played by four players , who play in two partnerships with the partners sitting opposite each other . [SEP]
[CLS] players draw cards to determine dealer and partners , with the two highest playing against the lowest two , who have seating rights . [SEP]
[CLS] to comment on the cards in any way is strictly against the rules . [SEP]
[CLS] one may not comment upon the hand one was dealt nor about one ' s good fortune or bad fortune . [SEP]
[CLS] one may not signal to one ' s partner . [SEP]
[CLS] the cards can be shuffled by any player , though usually the player to dealer ' s left . [SEP]
[CLS] the dealer has the right to shuffle last if they wish . [SEP]
[CLS] to speed up dealing , a second pack can be shuffled by the dealer ' s partner during the deal and then placed to the right ready for the next hand . [SEP]
[CLS] the cards are cut by the player on dealer ' s right before dealing . [SEP]
[CLS] the dealer deals out all the cards , one at a time , face down , so that each player has thirteen cards . [SEP]
[CLS] the final card , which belongs to the dealer , is turned face up to indicate which suit is trump ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the turned - up trump card remains face up on the table until it is the dealer ' s turn to play to the first trick , at which point the dealer may pick up the card and place it in their hand . [SEP]
[CLS] the deal advances clockwise . [SEP]
[CLS] the player to the dealer ' s left leads to the first trick . [SEP]
[CLS] he may lead any card in his hand . [SEP]
[CLS] the other players , in clockwise order , each play a card to the trick and must follow suit by playing a card of the suit led if he has one . [SEP]
[CLS] a player with no card of the suit led may play any card , either disc ##arding or trump ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] the trick is won by the highest card of the suit led , unless a trump is played , in which case the highest trump wins . [SEP]
[CLS] the winner of the trick leads the next trick . [SEP]
[CLS] play continues until all thirteen tricks are played , at which point the score is recorded . [SEP]
[CLS] if no team has enough points to win the game , another hand is played . [SEP]
[CLS] part of the skill involved in the game is one ' s ability to remember what cards have been played and reason out what cards remain . [SEP]
[CLS] therefore , once each trick is played , its cards are turned face down and kept in a stack of four near the player who won the trick . [SEP]
[CLS] before the next trick starts , a player may ask to review the cards from the last trick only . [SEP]
[CLS] once the lead card is played , however , no previously played cards can be reviewed by anyone . [SEP]
[CLS] after all tricks have been played , the side which won more tricks scores 1 point for each trick won in excess of 6 . [SEP]
[CLS] when all four players are experienced , it is unusual for the score for a single hand to be higher than two . [SEP]
[CLS] a game is over when one team reaches a score of five . [SEP]
[CLS] there are so - called " hotel rules " variations where other numbers are agreed to be played to in advance such as " american " and " long " , where the games are played to seven and nine respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] the " long " version is normally combined with " honours . " [SEP]
[CLS] in longer variations of the game , those games where the winning score is not the standard 5 points , honours are points that are claimed at the end of each hand . [SEP]
[CLS] honours add nothing to the play of a hand . [SEP]
[CLS] honours serve only as an element of luck that speeds up games , and they are often omitted . [SEP]
[CLS] serious players disdain honours because it greatly increases the element of chance . [SEP]
[CLS] a team that was dealt the top four cards ( a , k , q , j ) in the trump suit collect extra points . [SEP]
[CLS] a team who holds three of the four honours between them claim 2 points , a team who holds all four honours between them claim 4 points . [SEP]
[CLS] tricks are scored before honours . [SEP]
[CLS] honours points can never be used for the last point of a game . [SEP]
[CLS] consider the following example : a game is being played to 9 points . [SEP]
[CLS] the score is tied at 6 . [SEP]
[CLS] a hand is played and the winner of that hand took seven tricks and claimed honours . [SEP]
[CLS] that team would receive 1 point for the 7th trick and only 1 point for honours . [SEP]
[CLS] the score would then be 8 to 6 . [SEP]
[CLS] a w ##his ##t drive is a social event at which progressive games of w ##his ##t are played . [SEP]
[CLS] w ##his ##t has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power ; and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently una ##cco ##unt ##able delight in it , . . . " his only past ##ime was reading the papers and playing w ##his ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] he frequently won at this quiet game , so very appropriate to his nature ; . . . " [SEP]
