The Arno is a river in the Tuscany region of Italy.
It is the most important river of central Italy after the Tiber.
The river originates on Mount Falterona in the Casentino area of the Apennines, and initially takes a southward curve.
The river turns to the west near Arezzo passing through Florence, Empoli and Pisa, flowing into the Tyrrhenian Sea at Marina di Pisa.
With a length of 241 km , it is the largest river in the region.
It has many tributaries: Sieve at 60 km long, Bisenzio at 49 km , and the Era, Elsa, Pesa, and Pescia.
It crosses Florence, where it passes below the Ponte Vecchio and the Santa Trinita bridge (built by Bartolomeo Ammanati but inspired by Michelangelo).
The river flooded this city regularly in historical times, most recently in 1966, with 4500 m3/s after rainfall of 437.2 mm in Badia Agnano and 190 mm in Florence, in only 24 hours.
Before Pisa, the Arno is crossed by the Imperial Canal at La Botte.
This water channel passes under the Arno through a tunnel, and serves to drain the former area of the Lago di Bientina, which was once the largest lake in Tuscany before its reclamation.
The flow rate of the Arno is irregular.
It is sometimes described as having a torrentlike behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near flood in a few days.
At the point where the Arno leaves the Apennines, flow measurements can vary between 0.56 and .
New dams built upstream of Florence have greatly alleviated the problem in recent years.
The flood on November 4, 1966 collapsed the embankment in Florence, killing at least 40 people and damaging or destroying millions of works of art and rare books.
New conservation techniques were inspired by the disaster, but even decades later hundreds of works still await restoration.
From Latin "Arnus" (Pliny, "Natural History" 3.50).
The philologist Hans Krahe related this toponym on a paleo-European basis "*Ar-n-", derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *"er-", "flow, move".
