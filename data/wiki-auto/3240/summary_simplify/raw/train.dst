The Arno is a river in the Tuscany region of Italy.
It is the most important river of central Italy after the Tiber.
The river originates on Mount Falterona in the Casentino area of the Apennines, and initially takes a southward curve.
The river turns to the west near Arezzo passing through Florence, Empoli and Pisa, flowing into the Tyrrhenian Sea at Marina di Pisa.
It crosses Florence, where it passes below the Ponte Vecchio and the Santa Trinita bridge (built by Bartolomeo Ammanati but inspired by Michelangelo).
Before Pisa, the Arno is crossed by the Imperial Canal at La Botte.
This water channel passes under the Arno through a tunnel, and serves to drain the former area of the Lago di Bientina, which was once the largest lake in Tuscany before its reclamation.
It is sometimes described as having a torrentlike behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near flood in a few days.
The flood on November 4, 1966 collapsed the embankment in Florence, killing at least 40 people and damaging or destroying millions of works of art and rare books.
New conservation techniques were inspired by the disaster, but even decades later hundreds of works still await restoration.
