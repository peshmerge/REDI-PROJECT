the arno is a river in tuscany , italy .
it is the most important river of central italy after the tiber river .
the river originates on mount falterona in the casentino area of the apennines , and takes a southward curve .
it then turns to the west near arezzo .
it crosses florence , where it passes under the ponte vecchio and the santa trinita bridge commissioners built by bartolomeo ammanati .
before pisa , the arno is crossed by the imperial canal at la botte .
this water channel passes under the arno through a tunnel .
it can easily go from almost dry to near flood in a few days .
the flood on november 4,1966 collapsed the embankment in florence .
new conservation techniques were inspired by the disaster , but even decades later hundreds of works still not restored .
