The Arno is a river in the Tuscany region of Italy.
It is one of the important rivers of central Italy.
The river begins on Mount Falterona in the Casentino area of the Apennines.
It first takes a curve to the south.
The river turns to the west near Arezzo.
It passes through Florence, Empoli and Pisa, then flows into the Tyrrhenian Sea at the Marina di Pisa.
At a length of 241 km, it is the longest river in the region.
A flood on November 4, 1966 collapsed the embankment in Florence.
This killed at least 40 people.
It also damaged or destroyed millions of works of art and rare books.
40 years later, hundreds of works have still not been restored.
