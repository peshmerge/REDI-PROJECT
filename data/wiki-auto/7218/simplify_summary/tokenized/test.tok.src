[CLS] its american name derives from the dutch word " ko ##ek ##je " or more precisely its informal , dialect variant " ko ##eki ##e " which means " little cake , " and arrived in american english with the dutch settlement of new net ##her ##land , in the early 1600 ##s . [SEP]

[CLS] cookies are made in a wide variety of styles , using an array of ingredients including sugar ##s , spices , chocolate , butter , peanut butter , nuts , or dried fruits . [SEP]
[CLS] the softness of the cookie may depend on how long it is baked . [SEP]
[CLS] a general theory of cookies may be formulated this way . [SEP]
[CLS] despite its descent from cakes and other sweet ##ened bread ##s , the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for co ##hesion . [SEP]
[CLS] water in cakes serves to make the base ( in the case of cakes called " batter " ) as thin as possible , which allows the bubbles – responsible for a cake ' s flu ##ffin ##ess – to better form . [SEP]
[CLS] in the cookie , the agent of co ##hesion has become some form of oil . [SEP]
[CLS] oils , whether they be in the form of butter , vegetable oils , or la ##rd , are much more vis ##cous than water and eva ##por ##ate freely at a much higher temperature than water . [SEP]
[CLS] thus a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is far dense ##r after removal from the oven . [SEP]
[CLS] oils in baked cakes do not behave as soda tends to in the finished result . [SEP]
[CLS] rather than eva ##por ##ating and thick ##ening the mixture , they remain , sat ##ura ##ting the bubbles of escaped gases from what little water there might have been in the eggs , if added , and the carbon dioxide released by heating the baking powder . [SEP]
[CLS] this sat ##uration produces the most text ##ural ##ly attractive feature of the cookie , and indeed all fried foods : crisp ##ness saturated with a moisture ( namely oil ) that does not sink into it . [SEP]
[CLS] cookie - like hard wa ##fers have existed for as long as baking is documented , in part because they deal with travel very well , but they were usually not sweet enough to be considered cookies by modern standards . [SEP]
[CLS] cookies appear to have their origins in 7th century ad persia , shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region . [SEP]
[CLS] they spread to europe through the muslim conquest of spain . [SEP]
[CLS] by the 14th century , they were common in all levels of society throughout europe , from royal cuisine to street vendors . [SEP]
[CLS] with global travel becoming widespread at that time , cookies made a natural travel companion , a modernized equivalent of the travel cakes used throughout history . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the most popular early cookies , which traveled especially well and became known on every continent by similar names , was the ju ##mble , a relatively hard cookie made largely from nuts , sweet ##ener , and water . [SEP]
[CLS] cookies came to america through the dutch in new amsterdam in the late 1620 ##s . [SEP]
