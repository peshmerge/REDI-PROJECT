[CLS] despite its descent from cakes and other sweet ##ened bread ##s , the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for co ##hesion . [SEP]

[CLS] oils , whether they be in the form of butter , vegetable oils , or la ##rd , are much more vis ##cous than water and eva ##por ##ate freely at a much higher temperature than water . [SEP]
[CLS] rather than eva ##por ##ating and thick ##ening the mixture , they remain , sat ##ura ##ting the bubbles of escaped gases from what little water there might have been in the eggs , if added , and the carbon dioxide released by heating the baking powder . [SEP]
