[CLS] a vol ##tm ##eter is an instrument used for measuring electrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] analog vol ##tm ##eter ##s move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit ; digital vol ##tm ##eter ##s give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog to digital convert ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] a vol ##tm ##eter in a circuit diagram is represented by the letter " v " in a circle . [SEP]
[CLS] portable instruments , usually equipped to also measure current and resistance in the form of a multi ##meter , are standard test instruments used in electrical and electronics work . [SEP]
[CLS] any measurement that can be converted to a voltage can be displayed on a meter that is suit ##ably cal ##ib ##rated ; for example , pressure , temperature , flow or level in a chemical process plant . [SEP]
[CLS] general purpose analog vol ##tm ##eter ##s may have an accuracy of a few percent of full scale , and are used with voltage ##s from a fraction of a vol ##t to several thousand vol ##ts . [SEP]
[CLS] specially cal ##ib ##rated test instruments have higher acc ##ura ##cies , with laboratory instruments capable of measuring to acc ##ura ##cies of a few parts per million . [SEP]
[CLS] meters using amplifiers can measure tiny voltage ##s of micro ##vo ##lts or less . [SEP]
[CLS] in laboratories , the weston cell is used as a standard voltage for precision work . [SEP]
[CLS] a moving coil gal ##van ##ometer can be used as a vol ##tm ##eter by insert ##ing a resist ##or in series with the instrument . [SEP]
[CLS] the gal ##van ##ometer has a coil of fine wire suspended in a strong magnetic field . [SEP]
[CLS] when an electric current is applied , the interaction of the magnetic field of the coil and of the stationary magnet creates a torque , tending to make the coil rotate . [SEP]
[CLS] one of the design objectives of the instrument is to disturb the circuit as little as possible and so the instrument should draw a minimum of current to operate . [SEP]
[CLS] this is achieved by using a sensitive gal ##van ##ometer in series with a high resistance , and then the entire instrument is connected in parallel with the circuit examined . [SEP]
[CLS] the sensitivity of such a meter can be expressed as " oh ##ms per vol ##t " , the number of oh ##ms resistance in the meter circuit divided by the full scale measured value . [SEP]
[CLS] measurement of ac voltage requires a rec ##ti ##fi ##er in the circuit so that the coil def ##le ##cts in only one direction . [SEP]
[CLS] some moving - coil instruments are also made with the zero position in the middle of the scale instead of at one end ; these are useful if the voltage reverse ##s its polar ##ity . [SEP]
[CLS] vol ##tm ##eter ##s operating on the electro ##static principle use the mutual rep ##ulsion between two charged plates to def ##le ##ct a pointer attached to a spring . [SEP]
[CLS] meters of this type draw ne ##gli ##gible current but are sensitive to voltage ##s over about 100 vol ##ts and work with either alternating or direct current . [SEP]
[CLS] the sensitivity and input resistance of a vol ##tm ##eter can be increased if the current required to def ##le ##ct the meter pointer is supplied by an amplifier and power supply instead of by the circuit under test . [SEP]
[CLS] the electronic amplifier between input and meter gives two benefits ; a rugged moving coil instrument can be used , since its sensitivity need not be high , and the input resistance can be made high , reducing the current drawn from the circuit under test . [SEP]
[CLS] today these circuits use a solid - state amplifier using field - effect trans ##isto ##rs , hence fe ##t - v ##m , and appear in handheld digital multi ##meter ##s as well as in bench and laboratory instruments . [SEP]
[CLS] most vt ##v ##ms and fe ##t - v ##ms handle dc voltage , ac voltage , and resistance measurements ; modern fe ##t - v ##ms add current measurements and often other functions as well . [SEP]
[CLS] precision d ##v ##ms can have input resistance ##s of 1 g ##Ï‰ or higher for the lower voltage ranges ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] to ensure that a d ##v ##m ' s accuracy is within the manufacturer ' s specified tolerance ##s , it must be periodically cal ##ib ##rated against a voltage standard such as the weston cell . [SEP]
