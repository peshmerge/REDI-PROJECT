[CLS] marble is a meta ##morphic rock composed of rec ##rys ##tal ##lized carbonate minerals , most commonly cal ##cite or do ##lom ##ite . [SEP]
[CLS] marble is typically not f ##oli ##ated , although there are exceptions . [SEP]
[CLS] in geology , the term " marble " refers to meta ##mo ##rp ##hos ##ed limestone , but its use in stone ##mas ##on ##ry more broadly encompasses un ##met ##amo ##rp ##hos ##ed limestone . [SEP]
[CLS] marble is commonly used for sculpture and as a building material . [SEP]
[CLS] the word " marble " derives from the ancient greek , from , " crystalline rock , shining stone " , perhaps from the verb , " to flash , sparkle , gleam " ; r . s . p . bee ##kes has suggested that a " pre - greek origin is probable " . [SEP]
[CLS] this stem is also the ancestor of the english word " mar ##more ##al " , meaning " marble - like . " [SEP]
[CLS] while the english term " marble " resembles the french , most other european languages ( with words like " mar ##more ##al " ) more closely resemble the original ancient greek . [SEP]
[CLS] marble is a rock resulting from meta ##morphism of sedimentary carbonate rocks , most commonly limestone or do ##lom ##ite rock . [SEP]
[CLS] meta ##morphism causes variable rec ##rys ##tal ##lization of the original carbonate mineral grains . [SEP]
[CLS] the resulting marble rock is typically composed of an inter ##lock ##ing mosaic of carbonate crystals . [SEP]
[CLS] primary sedimentary textures and structures of the original carbonate rock ( proto ##lit ##h ) have typically been modified or destroyed . [SEP]
[CLS] pure white marble is the result of meta ##morphism of a very pure ( si ##lica ##te - poor ) limestone or do ##lom ##ite proto ##lit ##h . [SEP]
[CLS] the characteristic swirl ##s and veins of many colored marble varieties are usually due to various mineral imp ##urities such as clay , si ##lt , sand , iron oxide ##s , or cher ##t which were originally present as grains or layers in the limestone . [SEP]
[CLS] green coloration is often due to serpent ##ine resulting from originally magnesium - rich limestone or do ##lom ##ite with si ##lica imp ##urities . [SEP]
[CLS] these various imp ##urities have been mobilized and rec ##rys ##tal ##lized by the intense pressure and heat of the meta ##morphism . [SEP]
[CLS] white marble has been prized for its use in sculptures since classical times . [SEP]
[CLS] this preference has to do with its softness , which made it easier to car ##ve , relative iso ##tro ##py and homo ##gen ##eit ##y , and a relative resistance to shattering . [SEP]
[CLS] also , the low index of ref ##raction of cal ##cite allows light to penetrate several mill ##imeters into the stone before being scattered out , resulting in the characteristic wax ##y look which gives " life " to marble sculptures of any kind , which is why many sculptors preferred and still prefer marble for sc ##ul ##pt ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] construction marble is a stone which is composed of cal ##cite , do ##lom ##ite or serpent ##ine which is capable of taking a polish . [SEP]
[CLS] more generally in construction , specifically the dimension stone trade , the term " marble " is used for any crystalline cal ##cit ##ic rock ( and some non - cal ##cit ##ic rocks ) useful as building stone . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , tennessee marble is really a dense gran ##ular fossil ##iferous gray to pink to maroon or ##do ##vic ##ian limestone , that geologist ##s call the ho ##lston formation . [SEP]
[CLS] ash ##ga ##bat , the capital city of turkmenistan , was recorded in the 2013 " guinness book of records " as having the world ' s highest concentration of white marble buildings . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the united states geological survey , u . s . domestic marble production in 2006 was 46 , 400 tons valued at about $ 18 . 1 million , compared to 72 , 300 tons valued at $ 18 . 9 million in 2005 . [SEP]
[CLS] crushed marble production ( for aggregate and industrial uses ) in 2006 was 11 . 8 million tons valued at $ 116 million , of which 6 . 5 million tons was finely ground calcium carbonate and the rest was construction aggregate . [SEP]
[CLS] for comparison , 2005 crushed marble production was 7 . 76 million tons valued at $ 58 . 7 million , of which 4 . 8 million tons was finely ground calcium carbonate and the rest was construction aggregate . [SEP]
[CLS] u . s . dimension marble demand is about 1 . 3 million tons . [SEP]
[CLS] the ds ##an world demand for ( finished ) marble index has shown a growth of 12 % annually for the 2000 – 2006 period , compared to 10 . 5 % annually for the 2000 – 2005 period . [SEP]
[CLS] the largest dimension marble application is tile . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1998 , marble production was dominated by 4 countries that accounted for almost half of world production of marble and decorative stone . [SEP]
[CLS] italy and china were the world leaders , each representing 16 % of world production , while spain and india produced 9 % and 8 % , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] italy is the world leader in marble export , with 20 % share in global marble production , followed by china with 16 % , india with 10 % , spain with 6 % , and portugal with 5 % . [SEP]
[CLS] dust produced by cutting marble could cause lung disease but more research needs to be carried out on whether dust filters and other safety products reduce this risk . [SEP]
[CLS] the occupational safety and health administration ( os ##ha ) has set the legal limit ( per ##missible exposure limit ) for marble exposure in the workplace as 15 mg / m total exposure and 5 mg / m respiratory exposure over an 8 - hour work ##day . [SEP]
[CLS] the national institute for occupational safety and health ( ni ##osh ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( re ##l ) of 10 mg / m total exposure and 5 mg / m respiratory exposure over an 8 - hour work ##day . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , vinegar or other acidic solutions should never be used on marble . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , outdoor marble statues , graves ##tones , or other marble structures are damaged by acid rain . [SEP]
[CLS] the halo ##al ##kali ##phi ##lic methyl ##ot ##rop ##hic bacterium " methyl ##op ##ha ##ga mu ##rata " was isolated from deteriorating marble in the k ##rem ##lin . [SEP]
[CLS] bacterial and fungal degradation was detected in four samples of marble from milan cathedral ; black " clad ##os ##por ##ium " attacked dried ac ##ryl ##ic resin using mel ##ani ##n . [SEP]
[CLS] as the favorite medium for greek and roman sculptors and architects ( see classical sculpture ) , marble has become a cultural symbol of tradition and refined taste . [SEP]
[CLS] its extremely varied and colorful patterns make it a favorite decorative material , and it is often im ##itated in background patterns for computer displays , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] places named after the stone include marble ##head , massachusetts ; marble ##head , ohio ; marble arch , london ; the sea of mar ##mara ; india ' s marble rocks ; and the towns of marble , minnesota ; marble , colorado ; marble falls , texas , and marble hill , manhattan , new york . [SEP]
[CLS] the elgin marble ##s are marble sculptures from the part ##hen ##on in athens that are on display in the british museum . [SEP]
[CLS] they were brought to britain by the earl of elgin . [SEP]
[CLS] marble dust is combined with cement or synthetic resin ##s to make " rec ##ons ##tituted " or " culture ##d marble " . [SEP]
[CLS] the appearance of marble can be simulated with faux mar ##bling , a painting technique that im ##itate ##s the stone ' s color patterns . [SEP]
