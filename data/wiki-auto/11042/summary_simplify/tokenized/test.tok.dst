[CLS] fat ##s are one of the three main macro ##nut ##rien ##ts , along with car ##bo ##hy ##dra ##tes and proteins . [SEP]
[CLS] fat molecules consist of primarily carbon and hydrogen atoms and are therefore hydro ##phobic and are soluble in organic solvent ##s and ins ##ol ##ub ##le in water . [SEP]
[CLS] " oil " normally refers to a lip ##id with short or un ##sat ##ura ##ted fatty acid chains that is liquid at room temperature , while " fat " ( in the strict sense ) specifically refers to lip ##ids that are solids at room temperature – however , " fat " ( in the broad sense ) may be used in food science as a synonym for lip ##id . [SEP]
[CLS] they are a necessary part of the diet of most het ##ero ##tro ##phs ( including humans ) and are the most energy dense , thus the most efficient form of energy storage . [SEP]
[CLS] some fatty acids that are set free by the digest ##ion of fat ##s are called essential because they cannot be synthesized in the body from simpler constituents . [SEP]
[CLS] fat ##s and other lip ##ids are broken down in the body by enzymes called lip ##ase ##s produced in the pan ##cre ##as . [SEP]
[CLS] fat ##s that are saturated fat ##s have no double bonds between the carbon ##s in the chain . [SEP]
[CLS] un ##sat ##ura ##ted fat ##s have one or more double bonded carbon ##s in the chain . [SEP]
[CLS] thus alpha - lin ##ole ##nic acid is called an omega - 3 fatty acid because the 3rd carbon from that end is the first double bonded carbon in the chain counting from that end . [SEP]
[CLS] un ##sat ##ura ##ted fat ##s can be altered by reaction with hydrogen effect ##ed by a catalyst . [SEP]
[CLS] this action , called hydrogen ##ation , tends to break all the double bonds and makes a fully saturated fat . [SEP]
[CLS] to make vegetable short ##ening , then , liquid " cis " - un ##sat ##ura ##ted fat ##s such as vegetable oils are hydrogen ##ated to produce saturated fat ##s , which have more desirable physical properties e . g . , they melt at a desirable temperature ( 30 – 40 °c ) , and store well , whereas poly ##un ##sat ##ura ##ted oils go ran ##ci ##d when they react with oxygen in the air . [SEP]
[CLS] saturated fat ##s can stack themselves in a closely packed arrangement , so they can solid ##ify easily and are typically solid at room temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , animal fat ##s tall ##ow and la ##rd are high in saturated fatty acid content and are solids . [SEP]
[CLS] fat ##s serve both as energy sources for the body , and as stores for energy in excess of what the body needs immediately . [SEP]
[CLS] fat ##s are broken down in the healthy body to release their constituents , g ##ly ##cer ##ol and fatty acids . [SEP]
[CLS] g ##ly ##cer ##ol itself can be converted to glucose by the liver and so become a source of energy . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many different kinds of fat ##s , but each is a variation on the same chemical structure . [SEP]
[CLS] as a simple visual illustration , if the kin ##ks and angles of these chains were straightened out , the molecule would have the shape of a capital letter e . [SEP]
[CLS] the fatty acids would each be a horizontal line ; the g ##ly ##cer ##ol " backbone " would be the vertical line that joins the horizontal lines . [SEP]
[CLS] the more carbon atoms there are in any fatty acid , the longer its chain will be . [SEP]
[CLS] long chains are more susceptible to inter ##mo ##le ##cular forces of attraction ( in this case , van der wa ##als forces ) , and so the longer ones melt at a higher temperature ( melting point ) . [SEP]
[CLS] fatty acid chains may also differ by length , often categorized as short to very long . [SEP]
[CLS] any of these ali ##pha ##tic fatty acid chains may be g ##ly ##cera ##ted and the resultant fat ##s may have tails of different lengths from very short tri ##form ##in to very long , e . g . , ce ##rot ##ic acid , or " he ##xa ##cos ##ano ##ic acid " , a 26 - carbon long - chain saturated fatty acid . [SEP]
[CLS] most fat ##s found in food , whether vegetable or animal , are made up of medium to long - chain fatty acids , usually of equal or nearly equal length . [SEP]
[CLS] many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this energy . [SEP]
[CLS] despite long - standing assertion ##s to the contrary , fatty acids can also be used as a source of fuel for brain cells . [SEP]
[CLS] fat ##s are also sources of essential fatty acids , an important dietary requirement . [SEP]
[CLS] when a particular substance , whether chemical or bio ##tic , reaches unsafe levels in the blood ##stream , the body can effectively dil ##ute — or at least maintain equilibrium of — the off ##ending substances by storing it in new fat tissue . [SEP]
[CLS] this helps to protect vital organs , until such time as the off ##ending substances can be meta ##bol ##ized or removed from the body by such means as ex ##cre ##tion , ur ##ination , accidental or intentional blood ##lett ##ing , se ##bu ##m ex ##cre ##tion , and hair growth . [SEP]
[CLS] in animals , adi ##pose tissue , or fatty tissue is the body ' s means of storing metabolic energy over extended periods of time . [SEP]
[CLS] under energy stress these cells may de ##grade their stored fat to supply fatty acids and also g ##ly ##cer ##ol to the circulation . [SEP]
[CLS] the location of the tissue determines its metabolic profile : vis ##cera ##l fat is located within the abdominal wall ( i . e . , beneath the wall of abdominal muscle ) whereas " sub ##cut ##aneous fat " is located beneath the skin ( and includes fat that is located in the abdominal area beneath the skin but " above " the abdominal muscle wall ) . [SEP]
[CLS] vis ##cera ##l fat was recently discovered to be a significant producer of signaling chemicals ( i . e . , hormones ) , among which several are involved in inflammatory tissue responses . [SEP]
[CLS] studies have found that replacing saturated fat ##s with " cis " un ##sat ##ura ##ted fat ##s in the diet reduces risk of cardiovascular disease . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , a 2015 systematic review of random ##ized control trials by the cochrane library concluded : " lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by un ##sat ##ura ##ted fat ##s . " [SEP]
[CLS] the harvard school of public health advises that replacing " trans " fat ##s and saturated fat ##s with " cis " mono ##un ##sat ##ura ##ted and poly ##un ##sat ##ura ##ted fat ##s is beneficial for health . [SEP]
[CLS] a 2014 meta - analyses of random ##ized controlled trials found that reducing fat and cho ##les ##terol intake does not effect cardiovascular disease or all cause mortality . [SEP]
