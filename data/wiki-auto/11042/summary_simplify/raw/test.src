Fats are one of the three main macronutrients, along with carbohydrates and proteins.
Fat molecules consist of primarily carbon and hydrogen atoms and are therefore hydrophobic and are soluble in organic solvents and insoluble in water.
"Oil" normally refers to a lipid with short or unsaturated fatty acid chains that is liquid at room temperature, while "fat" (in the strict sense) specifically refers to lipids that are solids at room temperature – however, "fat" (in the broad sense) may be used in food science as a synonym for lipid.
They are a necessary part of the diet of most heterotrophs (including humans) and are the most energy dense, thus the most efficient form of energy storage.
Some fatty acids that are set free by the digestion of fats are called essential because they cannot be synthesized in the body from simpler constituents.
Fats and other lipids are broken down in the body by enzymes called lipases produced in the pancreas.
Fats that are saturated fats have no double bonds between the carbons in the chain.
Unsaturated fats have one or more double bonded carbons in the chain.
Thus alpha-linolenic acid is called an omega-3 fatty acid because the 3rd carbon from that end is the first double bonded carbon in the chain counting from that end.
Unsaturated fats can be altered by reaction with hydrogen effected by a catalyst.
This action, called hydrogenation, tends to break all the double bonds and makes a fully saturated fat.
To make vegetable shortening, then, liquid "cis"-unsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are hydrogenated to produce saturated fats, which have more desirable physical properties e.g., they melt at a desirable temperature (30–40 °C), and store well, whereas polyunsaturated oils go rancid when they react with oxygen in the air.
Saturated fats can stack themselves in a closely packed arrangement, so they can solidify easily and are typically solid at room temperature.
For example, animal fats tallow and lard are high in saturated fatty acid content and are solids.
Fats serve both as energy sources for the body, and as stores for energy in excess of what the body needs immediately.
Fats are broken down in the healthy body to release their constituents, glycerol and fatty acids.
Glycerol itself can be converted to glucose by the liver and so become a source of energy.
There are many different kinds of fats, but each is a variation on the same chemical structure.
As a simple visual illustration, if the kinks and angles of these chains were straightened out, the molecule would have the shape of a capital letter E.
The fatty acids would each be a horizontal line; the glycerol "backbone" would be the vertical line that joins the horizontal lines.
The more carbon atoms there are in any fatty acid, the longer its chain will be.
Long chains are more susceptible to intermolecular forces of attraction (in this case, van der Waals forces), and so the longer ones melt at a higher temperature (melting point).
Fatty acid chains may also differ by length, often categorized as short to very long.
Any of these aliphatic fatty acid chains may be glycerated and the resultant fats may have tails of different lengths from very short triformin to very long, e.g., cerotic acid, or "hexacosanoic acid", a 26-carbon long-chain saturated fatty acid.
Most fats found in food, whether vegetable or animal, are made up of medium to long-chain fatty acids, usually of equal or nearly equal length.
Many cell types can use either glucose or fatty acids for this energy.
Despite long-standing assertions to the contrary, fatty acids can also be used as a source of fuel for brain cells.
Fats are also sources of essential fatty acids, an important dietary requirement.
When a particular substance, whether chemical or biotic, reaches unsafe levels in the bloodstream, the body can effectively dilute—or at least maintain equilibrium of—the offending substances by storing it in new fat tissue.
This helps to protect vital organs, until such time as the offending substances can be metabolized or removed from the body by such means as excretion, urination, accidental or intentional bloodletting, sebum excretion, and hair growth.
In animals, adipose tissue, or fatty tissue is the body's means of storing metabolic energy over extended periods of time.
Under energy stress these cells may degrade their stored fat to supply fatty acids and also glycerol to the circulation.
The location of the tissue determines its metabolic profile: visceral fat is located within the abdominal wall (i.e., beneath the wall of abdominal muscle) whereas "subcutaneous fat" is located beneath the skin (and includes fat that is located in the abdominal area beneath the skin but "above" the abdominal muscle wall).
Visceral fat was recently discovered to be a significant producer of signaling chemicals (i.e., hormones), among which several are involved in inflammatory tissue responses.
Studies have found that replacing saturated fats with "cis" unsaturated fats in the diet reduces risk of cardiovascular disease.
For example, a 2015 systematic review of randomized control trials by the Cochrane Library concluded: "Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats."
The Harvard School of Public Health advises that replacing "trans" fats and saturated fats with "cis" monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats is beneficial for health.
a 2014 meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials found that reducing fat and cholesterol intake does not effect cardiovascular disease or all cause mortality.
