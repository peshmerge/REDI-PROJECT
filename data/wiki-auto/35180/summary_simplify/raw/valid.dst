It was the first year of the Common Era (CE), of the 1st millennium and of the 1st century.
In its time, year 1 was known as the Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Paullus, named after Roman consuls Gaius Caesar and Lucius Aemilius Paullus, and less frequently, as year 754 AUC ("ab urbe condita") within the Roman Empire.
The denomination "AD 1" for this year has been in consistent use since the mid-medieval period when the anno Domini (AD) calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
The preceding year is 1 BC; there is no year 0 in this numbering scheme.
The Julian calendar, a 45 BC reform of the Roman calendar, was the calendar used by Rome in AD 1.
