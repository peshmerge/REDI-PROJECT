[CLS] igor f ##yo ##dor ##ovich st ##ra ##vinsky com ##se ( ; russian : ; 17 june o . s . 5 june 1882 6 april 1971 ) was a russian - born composer , pianist , and conductor . [SEP]
[CLS] he is widely considered one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky ' s composition ##al career was notable for its stylistic diversity . [SEP]
[CLS] he first achieved international fame with three ballet ##s commissioned by the imp ##res ##ario serge dia ##ghi ##lev and first performed in paris by dia ##ghi ##lev ' s ballet ##s russ ##es : " the fire ##bird " ( 1910 ) , " pet ##rus ##h ##ka " ( 1911 ) , and " the rite of spring " ( 1913 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the latter transformed the way in which subsequent composers thought about rhythmic structure and was largely responsible for st ##ra ##vinsky ' s enduring reputation as a musical revolutionary who pushed the boundaries of musical design . [SEP]
[CLS] his " russian phase " which continued with works such as " ren ##ard " , the " soldier ' s tale " and " les no ##ces " , was followed in the 1920s by a period in which he turned to neo ##class ##ici ##sm . [SEP]
[CLS] the works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms ( concerto gross ##o , fu ##gue and symphony ) , drawing on earlier styles , especially from the 18th century . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1950s , st ##ra ##vinsky adopted serial procedures . [SEP]
[CLS] his compositions of this period shared traits with examples of his earlier output : rhythmic energy , the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few two - or three - note cells and clarity of form , and of instrumentation . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky was born on 17 june 1882 in or ##ani ##en ##baum , a suburb of saint petersburg , the russian imperial capital , and was brought up in saint petersburg . [SEP]
[CLS] his parents were f ##yo ##dor st ##ra ##vinsky ( 1843 – 1902 ) , a well - known bass at the kiev opera house and the mari ##insky theatre in st . petersburg , and anna ( nee k ##hol ##od ##ov ##skaya ; 1854 – 1939 ) , a native of kiev , one of four daughters of a high - ranking official in the kiev ministry of estates . [SEP]
[CLS] f ##yo ##dor , who was born into a mixed polish - russian family , was " descended from a long line of polish grande ##es , senators and landowners . " [SEP]
[CLS] it is believed that st ##ra ##vinsky ’ s ancestry is trace ##able back to the 17th and 18th centuries , to the bearer ##s of the soul ##ima and straw ##inski coat of arms . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky ' s family branch most likely came from st ##ra ##vin ##ska ##s , polo ##ni ##zed lithuanian ( or belarus ##sian ) land owners , and nobles of the grand duchy of lithuania . [SEP]
[CLS] according to st ##ra ##vinsky himself , his family originally had a soul ##ima - st ##ra ##vinsky surname , and the name " st ##ra ##vinsky " originated from the word " st ##ra ##va " , which is one of the variants of the st ##re ##va river in lithuania ( tr ##aka ##i and ka ##unas district ) . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky recalled his school ##day ##s as being lonely , later saying that " i never came across anyone who had any real attraction for me " . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky began piano lessons as a young boy , studying music theory and attempting composition . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1890 , he saw a performance of tchaikovsky ' s ballet " the sleeping beauty " at the mari ##insky theatre . [SEP]
[CLS] by age fifteen , he had mastered men ##del ##sso ##hn ' s piano concerto in g minor and finished a piano reduction of a string quartet by g ##la ##zu ##nov , who reportedly considered st ##ra ##vinsky un ##music ##al and thought little of his skills . [SEP]
[CLS] despite his enthusiasm for music and their musical background , his parents expected him to study law . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky enrolled at the university of saint petersburg in 1901 , but he attended fewer than fifty class sessions during his four years of study . [SEP]
[CLS] in the summer of 1902 , st ##ra ##vinsky stayed with composer nikolai rim ##sky - ko ##rsa ##kov and his family in the german city of heidelberg , where rim ##sky - ko ##rsa ##kov , arguably the leading russian composer at that time , suggested to st ##ra ##vinsky that he should not enter the saint petersburg conservatoire but instead study composing by taking private lessons , in large part because of his age . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky ' s father died of cancer that year , by which time his son had already begun spending more time on his musical studies than on law . [SEP]
[CLS] the university was closed for two months in 1905 in the aftermath of bloody sunday : st ##ra ##vinsky was prevented from taking his final law examinations and later received a half - course diploma in april 1906 . [SEP]
[CLS] thereafter , he concentrated on studying music . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1905 , he began to take twice - weekly private lessons from rim ##sky - ko ##rsa ##kov , whom he came to regard as a second father . [SEP]
[CLS] these lessons continued until rim ##sky - ko ##rsa ##kov ' s death in 1908 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1905 , st ##ra ##vinsky was engaged to his cousin katherine ga ##vr ##yl ##iv ##na nose ##nko ( called " katy ##a " ) , whom he had known since early childhood . [SEP]
[CLS] in spite of the orthodox church ' s opposition to marriage between first cousins , the couple married on 23 january 1906 : their first two children , f ##yo ##dor ( theodore ) and lu ##dm ##ila , were born in 1907 and 1908 . [SEP]
[CLS] in february 1909 , two of st ##ra ##vinsky ' s orchestral works , the and ( " fireworks " ) were performed at a concert in saint petersburg , where they were heard by serge dia ##ghi ##lev , who was at that time involved in planning to present russian opera and ballet in paris . [SEP]
[CLS] dia ##ghi ##lev was sufficiently impressed by " fireworks " to commission st ##ra ##vinsky to carry out some orchestra ##tions and then to compose a full - length ballet score , " the fire ##bird " . [SEP]
[CLS] from approximately 1890 until 1914 the composer frequently visited us ##ti ##lu ##g , a town in the modern vol ##yn oblast , ukraine . [SEP]
[CLS] he spent most of his summers there , where his father - in - law had an estate . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1907 , st ##ra ##vinsky designed and built his own house in us ##ti ##lu ##g , which he called " my heavenly place " . [SEP]
[CLS] in this house , st ##ra ##vinsky worked on seventeen of his early compositions , among them " fe ##u d ' art ##ifice " , " the fire ##bird " , " pet ##rus ##h ##ka " , and " the rite of spring " . [SEP]
[CLS] recently renovated , the house is now a st ##ra ##vinsky house - museum open to the public . [SEP]
[CLS] many documents , letters , and photographs are on display there , and a st ##ra ##vinsky festival is held annually in the nearby town of lu ##tsk . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky became an overnight sensation following the success of the " fire ##bird " ' s premiere in paris on 25 june 1910 . [SEP]
[CLS] the composer had travelled from his estate in us ##ti ##lu ##g to paris in early june to attend the final rehearsals and the premiere of " the fire ##bird " . [SEP]
[CLS] his family joined him before the end of the ballet season and they decided to remain in the west for a time , as his wife was expecting their third child . [SEP]
[CLS] after spending the summer in la ba ##ule , brittany , they moved to switzerland in early september . [SEP]
[CLS] on 23 september , their second son , sv ##ia ##tos ##lav soul ##ima , was born at a maternity clinic in lausanne ; at the end of the month , they took up residence in clare ##ns . [SEP]
[CLS] over the next four years , st ##ra ##vinsky and his family lived in russia during the summer months and spent each winter in switzerland . [SEP]
[CLS] during this period , st ##ra ##vinsky composed two further works for the ballet ##s russ ##es : " pet ##rus ##h ##ka " ( 1911 ) , and " the rite of spring " ( 1913 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] shortly following the premiere of " the rite of spring " on 29 may 1913 , st ##ra ##vinsky contracted ty ##ph ##oid from eating bad oyster ##s , and was confined to a paris nursing home , unable to depart for us ##ti ##lu ##g until 11 july . [SEP]
[CLS] during the remainder of the summer , st ##ra ##vinsky turned his attention to completing his first opera , the " nightingale " ( usually known by its french title " le rossi ##gno ##l " ) , which he had begun in 1908 ( that is , " before " his association with the ballet ##s russ ##es ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the work had been commissioned by the moscow free theatre for the handsome fee of 10 , 000 rub ##les . [SEP]
[CLS] the st ##ra ##vinsky family returned to switzerland ( as usual ) in the fall of 1913 . [SEP]
[CLS] on 15 january 1914 , a fourth child , marie mile ##ne ( or maria mile ##na ) , was born in lausanne . [SEP]
[CLS] after her delivery , katy ##a was discovered to have tuberculosis and was confined to the san ##ator ##ium at ley ##sin , high in the alps . [SEP]
[CLS] igor and the family took up residence nearby , and he completed " le rossi ##gno ##l " there on 28 march . [SEP]
[CLS] in april , they were finally able to return to clare ##ns . [SEP]
[CLS] by then , the moscow free theatre had gone bankrupt . [SEP]
[CLS] as a result , " le rossi ##gno ##l " was first performed under dia ##ghi ##lev ' s auspices at the paris opera on 26 may 1914 , with sets and costumes designed by alexandre ben ##ois . [SEP]
[CLS] " le rossi ##gno ##l " enjoyed only luke ##war ##m success with the public and the critics , apparently because its del ##ica ##cy did not meet their expectations of the composer of " the rite " " of spring . " [SEP]
[CLS] however , composers including maurice rave ##l , bela bart ##ok , and rey ##nal ##do hahn found much to admire in the score ' s craftsman ##ship , even alleging to detect the influence of arnold sc ##hoe ##nberg . [SEP]
[CLS] in july , with war looming , st ##ra ##vinsky made a quick trip to us ##ti ##lu ##g to retrieve personal effects including his reference works on russian folk music . [SEP]
[CLS] he returned to switzerland just before national borders closed following the outbreak of world war i . [SEP]
[CLS] the war and subsequent russian revolution made it impossible for st ##ra ##vinsky to return to his homeland , and he did not set foot upon russian soil again until october 1962 . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 1915 , st ##ra ##vinsky and his family moved from clare ##ns to mor ##ges , a town six miles south - west of lausanne on the shore of lake geneva . [SEP]
[CLS] the family lived there ( at three different addresses ) until 1920 . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky struggled financially during this period . [SEP]
[CLS] russia ( and its successor , the ussr ) did not adhere to the bern ##e convention and this created problems for st ##ra ##vinsky when collecting royalties for the performances of all his ballet ##s russ ##es compositions . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky blamed dia ##ghi ##lev for his financial troubles , accusing him of failing to live up to the terms of a contract they had signed . [SEP]
[CLS] he approached the swiss philanthropist werner rein ##hart for financial assistance while he was writing " l ' histoire du sold ##at " ( " the soldier ' s tale " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] rein ##hart sponsored and largely under ##wr ##ote its first performance , conducted by ernest an ##ser ##met on 28 september 1918 at the theatre municipal de lausanne . [SEP]
[CLS] in gratitude , st ##ra ##vinsky dedicated the work to rein ##hart and gave him the original manuscript . [SEP]
[CLS] rein ##hart supported st ##ra ##vinsky further when he funded a series of concerts of his chamber music in 1919 : included was a suite from " l ' histoire du sold ##at " arranged for violin , piano and clarinet , which was first performed on 8 november 1919 , in lausanne . [SEP]
[CLS] in gratitude to his benefactor , st ##ra ##vinsky also dedicated his " three pieces for clarinet " ( october – november 1918 ) to rein ##hart , who was an excellent amateur clarinet ##ist . [SEP]
[CLS] following the premiere of " pu ##lc ##ine ##lla " by the ballet ##s russ ##es in paris on 15 may 1920 , st ##ra ##vinsky returned to switzerland . [SEP]
[CLS] on 8 june , the entire family left mor ##ges for the last time , and moved to the fishing village of cara ##nte ##c in brittany for the summer while also seeking a new home in paris . [SEP]
[CLS] on hearing of their dilemma , co ##ut ##uri ##ere coco chan ##el invited st ##ra ##vinsky and his family to reside at her new mansion " bel res ##pi ##ro " in the paris suburb of ga ##rch ##es until they could find a more suitable residence ; they arrived during the second week of september . [SEP]
[CLS] at the same time , chan ##el also guaranteed the new ( december 1920 ) ballet ##s russ ##es production of st ##ra ##vinsky ' s " the rite " " of spring " with an anonymous gift to dia ##ghi ##lev , said to have been 300 , 000 francs . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky formed a business and musical relationship with the french piano manufacturing company pl ##eye ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] pl ##eye ##l essentially acted as his agent in collecting mechanical royalties for his works and provided him with a monthly income and a studio space at its headquarters in which he could work and entertain friends and business acquaintances . [SEP]
[CLS] under the terms of his contract with the company , st ##ra ##vinsky agreed to arrange ( and to some extent re - compose ) many of his early works for the pl ##eye ##la , pl ##eye ##l ' s brand of player piano . [SEP]
[CLS] he did so in a way that made full use of all of the piano ' s eighty - eight notes , without regard for human fingers or hands . [SEP]
[CLS] the rolls were not recorded , but were instead marked up from a combination of manuscript fragments and hand ##written notes by jacques la ##rman ##ja ##t , musical director of pl ##eye ##l ' s roll department . [SEP]
[CLS] among the compositions that were issued on the pl ##eye ##la piano rolls are " the rite of spring " , " pet ##rus ##h ##ka " , " the fire ##bird " , and " song of the nightingale " . [SEP]
[CLS] during the 1920s , st ##ra ##vinsky recorded duo - art rolls for the ae ##oli ##an company in both london and new york , not all of which have survived . [SEP]
[CLS] patronage was never far away . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 1920s , leopold st ##oko ##wski gave st ##ra ##vinsky regular support through a pseudonym ##ous ' benefactor ' . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky met vera de boss ##et in paris in february 1921 , while she was married to the painter and stage designer serge sud ##ei ##kin , and they began an affair that led to vera leaving her husband . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 1921 , st ##ra ##vinsky and his family moved to angle ##t , near bi ##ar ##rit ##z , southwestern france . [SEP]
[CLS] from then until his wife ' s death in 1939 , st ##ra ##vinsky led a double life , dividing his time between his family in angle ##t , and vera in paris and on tour . [SEP]
[CLS] katy ##a reportedly bore her husband ' s in ##fide ##lity " with a mixture of magna ##ni ##mity , bitterness , and compassion " . [SEP]
[CLS] in september 1924 , st ##ra ##vinsky bought " an expensive house " in nice : the villa des roses . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1931 to 1933 , the st ##ra ##vinsky ##s lived in vo ##re ##ppe , near gr ##eno ##ble , southeastern france . [SEP]
[CLS] the st ##ra ##vinsky ##s became french citizens in 1934 and moved to the rue du fa ##ub ##our ##g saint - honor ##e in paris . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky later remembered this last european address as his un ##ha ##pp ##iest , as his wife ' s tuberculosis infected both himself and his eldest daughter lu ##dm ##ila , who died in 1938 . [SEP]
[CLS] katy ##a , to whom he had been married for 33 years , died of tuberculosis three months later , in march 1939 . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky himself spent five months in hospital , during which time his mother died . [SEP]
[CLS] during his later years in paris , st ##ra ##vinsky had developed professional relationships with key people in the united states : he was already working on his symphony in c for the chicago symphony orchestra and he had agreed to deliver the prestigious charles eliot norton lectures at harvard university during the 1939 – 40 academic year . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the outbreak of world war ii on 1 september 1939 , the widowed st ##ra ##vinsky sailed ( alone ) for the united states at the end of the month , arriving in new york city and thence to cambridge , massachusetts , to fulfill his engagement at harvard . [SEP]
[CLS] vera followed him in january , and they were married in bedford , massachusetts , on 9 march 1940 . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky settled in west hollywood . [SEP]
[CLS] he spent more time living in los angeles than any other city . [SEP]
[CLS] he became a naturalized united states citizen in 1945 . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky had adapted to life in france , but moving to america at the age of 57 was a very different prospect . [SEP]
[CLS] for a while , he maintained a circle of contacts and emi ##gre friends from russia , but he eventually found that this did not sustain his intellectual and professional life . [SEP]
[CLS] he was drawn to the growing cultural life of los angeles , especially during world war ii , when so many writers , musicians , composers and conductors settled in the area : these included otto k ##lem ##per ##er , thomas mann , franz we ##rf ##el , george bala ##nch ##ine and arthur rubin ##stein . [SEP]
[CLS] bernard holland claimed st ##ra ##vinsky was especially fond of british writers , who visited him in beverly hills , " like w . h . au ##den , christopher is ##her ##wood , dylan thomas . [SEP]
[CLS] they shared the composer ' s taste for hard spirits – especially aldo ##us hu ##xley , with whom st ##ra ##vinsky spoke in french " . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky and hu ##xley had a tradition of saturday lunch ##es for west coast avant - garde and lu ##mina ##ries . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky ' s unconventional dominant seventh chord in his arrangement of the " star - span ##gled banner " led to an incident with the boston police on 15 january 1944 , and he was warned that the authorities could impose a $ 100 fine upon any " re - arrangement of the national anthem in whole or in part " . [SEP]
[CLS] the police , as it turned out , were wrong . [SEP]
[CLS] the law in question merely forbade using the national anthem " as dance music , as an exit march , or as a part of a medley of any kind " , but the incident soon established itself as a myth , in which st ##ra ##vinsky was supposedly arrested , held in custody for several nights , and photographed for police records . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky ' s professional life encompassed most of the 20th century , including many of its modern classical music styles , and he influenced composers both during and after his lifetime . [SEP]
[CLS] included among his students in the 1940s was the american composer and music educator robert st ##ras ##sburg . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1959 , he was awarded the son ##ning award , denmark ' s highest musical honour . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 1960s his students included robert craft and warren zev ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] in september 1962 , st ##ra ##vinsky returned to russia for the first time since 1914 , accepting an invitation from the union of soviet composers to conduct six performances in moscow and leningrad . [SEP]
[CLS] during the three - week visit he met with soviet premier nikita k ##hr ##ush ##chev and several leading soviet composers , including dmitri sho ##sta ##kovich and ara ##m k ##ha ##cha ##tur ##ian . [SEP]
[CLS] in october 1969 , st ##ra ##vinsky relocated to an apartment in essex house in new york city . [SEP]
[CLS] among st ##ra ##vinsky ' s final projects was orchestra ##ting two prelude ##s from " the well - tempered cl ##avi ##er " by bach , but it was never completed . [SEP]
[CLS] on 18 march 1971 , st ##ra ##vinsky was taken to len ##ox hill hospital with pulmonary ed ##ema where he stayed for ten days . [SEP]
[CLS] on 29 march , he moved into a newly fur ##bis ##hed apartment at 92 ##0 fifth avenue , his first city apartment since living in paris in 1939 . [SEP]
[CLS] after a period of well being , the ed ##ema returned on 4 april and vera insisted that medical equipment should be installed in the apartment . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky soon stopped eating and drinking and died at 5 : 20 a . m . on 6 april at the age of 88 . [SEP]
[CLS] the cause on his death certificate is heart failure . [SEP]
[CLS] a funeral service was held three days later at frank e . campbell funeral chapel . [SEP]
[CLS] as per his wishes , he was buried in the russian corner of the cemetery island of san michele in northern italy , several yards from the tomb of sergei dia ##ghi ##lev . [SEP]
[CLS] he has a star on the hollywood walk of fame and in 1987 he was posthumously awarded the grammy award for lifetime achievement . [SEP]
[CLS] he was posthumously inducted into the national museum of dance and hall of fame in 2004 . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky ' s output is typically divided into three general style periods : a russian period , a neoclassical period , and a serial period . [SEP]
[CLS] aside from a very few surviving earlier works , st ##ra ##vinsky ' s russian period , sometimes called primitive period , began with compositions undertaken under the tu ##tel ##age of nikolai rim ##sky - ko ##rsa ##kov , with whom he studied from 1905 until rim ##sky ' s death in 1908 , including the orchestral works symphony in e ##♭ major ( 1907 ) , " fa ##un and shepherd ##ess " ( for me ##zzo - soprano and orchestra ; 1907 ) , " sc ##her ##zo fan ##tas ##tique " ( 1908 ) , and " fe ##u d ' art ##ifice " ( 1908 / 9 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these works clearly reveal the influence of rim ##sky - ko ##rsa ##kov , but as richard tar ##us ##kin has shown , they also reveal st ##ra ##vinsky ' s knowledge of music by g ##la ##zu ##nov , tan ##eye ##v , tchaikovsky , wagner , d ##vor ##ak , and de ##bus ##sy , among others . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1908 , st ##ra ##vinsky composed " funeral song " ( п ##о ##г ##р ##е ##б ##а ##л ##ь ##на ##я п ##е ##с ##н ##я ) , op . 5 to commemorate the death of nikolai rim ##sky - ko ##rsa ##kov . [SEP]
[CLS] the piece premiered 17 january 1909 in the grand hall of the saint petersburg conservatory but was then lost until september 2015 , when it res ##ur ##face ##d in a back room of the city ' s conservatoire . [SEP]
[CLS] it was played again for the first time in over a century on 2 december 2016 . [SEP]
[CLS] the red ##is ##co ##very generated much enthusiasm and , as a result , over 25 performances are scheduled in 2017 and beyond . [SEP]
[CLS] performances in st . petersburg of " sc ##her ##zo fan ##tas ##tique " and " fe ##u d ' art ##ifice " attracted the attention of serge dia ##ghi ##lev , who commissioned st ##ra ##vinsky to orchestra ##te two piano works of chopin for the ballet " les sy ##lp ##hide ##s " to be presented in the 1909 debut " sai ##son russ ##e " of his new ballet company . [SEP]
[CLS] " the fire ##bird " was first performed at the paris opera on 25 june 1910 by dia ##ghi ##lev ' s ballet ##s russ ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] like st ##ra ##vinsky ' s earlier student works , " the fire ##bird " continued to look backward to rim ##sky - ko ##rsa ##kov not only in its orchestra ##tion , but also in its overall structure , harmonic organization , and melodic content . [SEP]
[CLS] according to tar ##us ##kin , st ##ra ##vinsky ' s second ballet for the ballet russ ##es , " pet ##rus ##h ##ka " , is where " st ##ra ##vinsky at last became st ##ra ##vinsky . " [SEP]
[CLS] the music itself makes significant use of a number of russian folk tunes in addition to two waltz ##es by vie ##nne ##se composer joseph lan ##ner and a french music hall tune ( " la jam ##be en bois " or " the wooden leg " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in april 1915 , st ##ra ##vinsky received a commission from win ##nare ##tta singer ( princess ##e edmond de pol ##ign ##ac ) for a small - scale theatrical work to be performed in her paris salon . [SEP]
[CLS] the result was " ren ##ard " ( 1916 ) , which he called " a bu ##rle ##sque in song and dance " . [SEP]
[CLS] " ren ##ard " was st ##ra ##vinsky ' s first venture into experimental theatre : the composer ' s preface to the score specifies a tres ##tle stage on which all the performers ( including the instrumentalist ##s ) were to appear simultaneously and continuously . [SEP]
[CLS] " apollo ##n musa ##get ##e " ( 1928 ) , " per ##se ##phone " ( 1933 ) and " or ##pheus " ( 1947 ) ex ##em ##plify not only st ##ra ##vinsky ' s return to the music of the classical period but also his exploration of themes from the ancient classical world , such as greek mythology . [SEP]
[CLS] important works in this period include the oct ##et ( 1923 ) , the concerto for piano and winds ( 1924 ) , the serena ##de in a ( 1925 ) , and " symphony of psalms " ( 1930 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1951 , he completed his last neoclassical work , the opera " the rake ' s progress " to a libretto by w . h . au ##den and chester ka ##ll ##man based on the etc ##hing ##s of william hog ##arth . [SEP]
[CLS] it premiered in venice that year and was produced around europe the following year before being staged in the new york metropolitan opera in 1953 . [SEP]
[CLS] it was staged by the santa fe opera in a 1962 st ##ra ##vinsky festival in honor of the composer ' s 80 ##th birthday and was revived by the metropolitan opera in 1997 . [SEP]
[CLS] in the 1950s , st ##ra ##vinsky began using serial composition ##al techniques such as dod ##eca ##phon ##y , the twelve - tone technique originally devised by arnold sc ##hoe ##nberg . [SEP]
[CLS] he first experimented with non - twelve - tone serial techniques in small - scale vocal and chamber works such as the " cantata " ( 1952 ) , the sept ##et ( 1953 ) and " three songs from shakespeare " ( 1953 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the first of his compositions fully based on such techniques was " in memo ##riam dylan thomas " ( 1954 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] " ago ##n " ( 1954 – 57 ) was the first of his works to include a twelve - tone series and ( 1955 ) was the first piece to contain a movement entirely based on a tone row . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky expanded his use of dod ##eca ##phon ##y in works such as " th ##ren ##i " ( 1958 ) and " a sermon , a narrative and a prayer " ( 1961 ) , which are based on biblical texts , and " the flood " ( 1962 ) , which mixes brief biblical texts from the book of genesis with passages from the york and chester mystery plays . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky has been called " one of music ' s truly epoch ##al inn ##ova ##tors " . [SEP]
[CLS] the most important aspect of st ##ra ##vinsky ' s work , aside from his technical innovations ( including in rhythm and harmony ) , is the ' changing face ' of his composition ##al style while always ' retaining a distinctive , essential identity ' . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky ' s use of mo ##tiv ##ic development ( the use of musical figures that are repeated in different guise ##s throughout a composition or section of a composition ) included additive mo ##tiv ##ic development . [SEP]
[CLS] this is where notes are sub ##tracted or added to a motif without regard to the con ##se ##quent changes in metre . [SEP]
[CLS] a similar technique can be found as early as the 16th century , for example in the music of ci ##pr ##iano de ro ##re , or ##land ##us lass ##us , carlo ge ##su ##aldo and giovanni de mac ##que , music with which st ##ra ##vinsky exhibited considerable familiarity . [SEP]
[CLS] the " rite of spring " is notable for its relentless use of os ##tina ##ti , for example in the eighth - note os ##tina ##to on strings accent ##ed by eight horns in the section " aug ##urs of spring ( dances of the young girls ) " . [SEP]
[CLS] the work also contains passages where several os ##tina ##ti clash against one another . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky was noted for his distinctive use of rhythm , especially in the " rite of spring " ( 1913 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the composer philip glass , " the idea of pushing the rhythms across the bar lines . . . led the way . . . . [SEP]
[CLS] the rhythmic structure of music became much more fluid and in a certain way spontaneous " . [SEP]
[CLS] glass mentions st ##ra ##vinsky ' s " primitive , off ##beat rhythmic drive " . [SEP]
[CLS] according to andrew j . browne , " st ##ra ##vinsky is perhaps the only composer who has raised rhythm in itself to the dignity of art " . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky ' s rhythm and vital ##ity greatly influenced the composer aaron cop ##land . [SEP]
[CLS] over the course of his career , st ##ra ##vinsky called for a wide variety of orchestral , instrumental , and vocal forces , ranging from single instruments in such works as " three pieces for clarinet " ( 1918 ) or " el ##eg ##y for solo viola " ( 1944 ) to the enormous orchestra of " the " " rite of spring " ( 1913 ) , which aaron cop ##land characterized as " the foremost orchestral achievement of the 20th century . " [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky ’ s creation of unique and id ##ios ##yn ##cratic ensembles arising from the specific musical nature of individual works is a basic element of his style . [SEP]
[CLS] following the model of his teacher , nikolai rim ##sky - ko ##rsa ##kov , st ##ra ##vinsky ’ s student works such as the symphony in e ##♭ , op . 1 ( 1907 ) , " sc ##her ##zo fan ##tas ##tique " , op . 3 ( 1908 ) , and " fireworks " ( " fe ##u d ' art ##ifice " ) , op . 4 ( 1908 ) , call for large orchestral forces . [SEP]
[CLS] this is not surprising , as the works were as much exercises in orchestra ##tion as in composition . [SEP]
[CLS] the symphony , for example , calls for 3 flutes ( 3rd doubles piccolo ) ; 2 oboe ##s ; 3 clarinet ##s in b ##♭ ; 2 bass ##oons ; 4 horns in f ; 3 trumpets in b ##♭ ; 3 trombone ##s , tuba , tim ##pani , bass drum , triangle , cy ##mba ##ls , and strings . [SEP]
[CLS] the " sc ##her ##zo fan ##tas ##tique " calls for a slightly larger orchestra but completely om ##its trombone ##s : this was st ##ra ##vinsky ’ s response to rim ##sky ’ s criticism of their over ##use in the symphony . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky displayed a taste in literature that was wide and reflected his constant desire for new discoveries . [SEP]
[CLS] the texts and literary sources for his work began with a period of interest in russian folklore , which progressed to classical authors and the latin liturgy and moved on to contemporary france ( andre gi ##de , in " per ##se ##phone " ) and eventually english literature , including w . h . au ##den , t . s . eliot , and medieval english verse . [SEP]
[CLS] he also had an in ##ex ##haus ##ti ##ble desire to explore and learn about art , which manifested itself in several of his paris collaborations . [SEP]
[CLS] not only was he the principal composer for dia ##ghi ##lev ' s ballet ##s russ ##es , but he also collaborated with pablo picasso ( " pu ##lc ##ine ##lla " , 1920 ) , jean co ##ct ##eau ( " o ##ed ##ip ##us rex " , 1927 ) , and george bala ##nch ##ine ( , 1928 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] his interest in art propelled him to develop a strong relationship with picasso , whom he met in 1917 , announcing that in " a w ##hir ##lp ##ool of artistic enthusiasm and excitement i at last met picasso . " [SEP]
[CLS] from 1917 to 1920 , the two engaged in an artistic dialogue in which they exchanged small - scale works of art to each other as a sign of intimacy , which included the famous portrait of st ##ra ##vinsky by picasso , and st ##ra ##vinsky ' s " sketch of music for the clarinet " . [SEP]
[CLS] this exchange was essential to establish how the artists would approach their collaborative space in " pu ##lc ##ine ##lla " . [SEP]
[CLS] the young st ##ra ##vinsky was sympathetic to bourgeois liberalism and the aims of the constitutional democratic party , even composing an anthem for the russian provisional government , before shifting heavily towards the right following the october revolution . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1930 , he remarked , " i don ' t believe that anyone ve ##ner ##ates mussolini more than i . . . i know many ex ##al ##ted persona ##ges , and my artist ' s mind does not shrink from political and social issues . [SEP]
[CLS] well , after having seen so many events and so many more or less representative men , i have an over ##powering urge to render homage to your duc ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] he is the sa ##vio ##ur of italy and – let us hope – europe " . [SEP]
[CLS] later , after a private audience with mussolini , he added , " unless my ears dec ##ei ##ve me , the voice of rome is the voice of " il duc ##e " . [SEP]
[CLS] i told him that i felt like a fascist myself . . . in spite of being extremely busy , mussolini did me the great honour of con ##vers ##ing with me for three - quarters of an hour . [SEP]
[CLS] we talked about music , art and politics " . [SEP]
[CLS] when the nazis placed st ##ra ##vinsky ' s works on the list of " en ##tar ##tet ##e musik " , he lodged a formal appeal to establish his russian genealogy and declared , " i lo ##ath ##e all communism , marxism , the ex ##ec ##rable soviet monster , and also all liberalism , democrat ##ism , at ##hei ##sm , etc . " upon relocating to america in the 1940s , st ##ra ##vinsky again embraced the liberalism of his youth , remark ##ing that europeans " can have their general ##iss ##imo ##s and fu ##hrer ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] leave me mr . truman and i ' m satisfied . " [SEP]
[CLS] towards the end of his life , at craft ' s be ##hes ##t , st ##ra ##vinsky made a return visit to his native country and composed a cantata in hebrew , travelling to israel for its performance . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky proved adept at playing the part of a ' man of the world ' , acquiring a keen instinct for business matters and appearing relaxed and comfortable in public . [SEP]
[CLS] his successful career as a pianist and conductor took him to many of the world ' s major cities , including paris , venice , berlin , london , amsterdam and new york and he was known for his polite , court ##eous and helpful manner . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky was reputed to have been a phil ##ander ##er and was rum ##oured to have had affairs with high - profile partners , such as coco chan ##el . [SEP]
[CLS] he never referred to it himself , but chan ##el spoke about the alleged affair at length to her biographer paul moran ##d in 1946 ; the conversation was published thirty years later . [SEP]
[CLS] the accuracy of chan ##el ' s claims has been disputed by both st ##ra ##vinsky ' s widow , vera , and by craft . [SEP]
[CLS] chan ##el ' s fashion house ave ##rs there is no evidence that any affair between chan ##el and st ##ra ##vinsky ever occurred . [SEP]
[CLS] a fictional ##ization of the supposed affair formed the basis of the novel " coco and igor " ( 2002 ) and a film , " coco chan ##el & igor st ##ra ##vinsky " ( 2009 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] despite these alleged liaison ##s , st ##ra ##vinsky was considered a family man and devoted to his children . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky was a devout member of the russian orthodox church during most of his life , remark ##ing at one time that , " music praises god . [SEP]
[CLS] music is well or better able to praise him than the building of the church and all its decoration ; it is the church ' s greatest or ##name ##nt " . [SEP]
[CLS] although st ##ra ##vinsky was not outspoken about his faith , he was a deeply religious man throughout some periods of his life . [SEP]
[CLS] as a child , he was brought up by his parents in the russian orthodox church . [SEP]
[CLS] baptized at birth , he later rebelled against the church and abandoned it by the time he was fourteen or fifteen years old . [SEP]
[CLS] throughout the rise of his career he was estranged from christianity and it was not until he reached his early fort ##ies that he experienced a spiritual crisis . [SEP]
[CLS] after be ##fr ##ien ##ding a russian orthodox priest , father nicholas , after his move to nice in 1924 , he rec ##onne ##cted with his faith . [SEP]
[CLS] he rejoined the russian orthodox church and afterwards remained a committed christian . [SEP]
[CLS] robert craft noted that st ##ra ##vinsky prayed daily , before and after composing , and also prayed when facing difficulty . [SEP]
[CLS] towards the end of his life , he was no longer able to attend church services . [SEP]
[CLS] in his late seventies , st ##ra ##vinsky said : i cannot now evaluate the events that , at the end of those thirty years , made me discover the necessity of religious belief . [SEP]
[CLS] i was not reasoned into my disposition . [SEP]
[CLS] though i admire the structured thought of theology ( an ##sel ##m ' s proof in the " fide ##s qu ##aer ##ens intellect ##um " , for instance ) it is to religion no more than counter ##point exercises are to music . [SEP]
[CLS] i do not believe in bridges of reason or , indeed , in any form of extra ##pol ##ation in religious matters . [SEP]
[CLS] . . . i can say , however , that for some years before my actual " conversion " , a mood of acceptance had been cultivated in me by a reading of the gospels and by other religious literature . [SEP]
[CLS] if st ##ra ##vinsky ' s stated intention was " to send them all to hell " , then he may have rated the 1913 premiere of " the rite " " of spring " as a success : it is a famous classical music riot and st ##ra ##vinsky referred to it on several occasions in his autobiography as a " " . [SEP]
[CLS] there were reports of fist ##fight ##s in the audience and the need for a police presence during the second act . [SEP]
[CLS] the real extent of the tu ##mu ##lt is open to debate and the reports may be ap ##oc ##ry ##pha ##l . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1998 , " time " magazine named st ##avi ##nsky as one of the 100 most influential people of the century . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to the recognition he received for his compositions , he achieved fame as a pianist and a conductor , often at the premiere ##s of his works . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1923 , erik sat ##ie wrote an article about igor st ##ra ##vinsky in " vanity fair " . [SEP]
[CLS] sat ##ie had met st ##ra ##vinsky for the first time in 1910 . [SEP]
[CLS] in the published article , sat ##ie argued that measuring the " great ##ness " of an artist by comparing him to other artists , as if speaking about some " truth " , is ill ##uso ##ry and that every piece of music should be judged on its own merits and not by comparing it to the standards of other composers . [SEP]
[CLS] that was exactly what jean co ##ct ##eau did when he commented de ##pre ##cating ##ly on st ##ra ##vinsky in his 1918 book , . [SEP]
[CLS] according to " the musical times " in 1923 : all the signs indicate a strong reaction against the nightmare of noise and eccentric ##ity that was one of the leg ##acies of the war . . . what ( for example ) has become of the works that made up the program of the st ##ra ##vinsky concert which created such a stir a few years ago ? [SEP]
[CLS] practically the whole lot are already on the shelf , and they will remain there until a few jade ##d ne ##uro ##tics once more feel a desire to eat ashes and fill their belly with the east wind . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1935 , the american composer marc blitz ##stein compared st ##ra ##vinsky to ja ##co ##po per ##i and c . p . e . bach , con ##ced ##ing that , " there is no denying the great ##ness of st ##ra ##vinsky . [SEP]
[CLS] it is just that he is not great enough " . [SEP]
[CLS] blitz ##stein ' s marxist position was that st ##ra ##vinsky ' s wish to " divorce music from other streams of life " , which is " sy ##mpt ##oma ##tic of an escape from reality " , resulted in a " loss of st ##amina " , naming specifically " apollo " , the cap ##ric ##cio , and " le bai ##ser de la fee " . [SEP]
[CLS] the composer constant lambert described pieces such as " l ' histoire du sold ##at " as containing " essentially cold - blooded abstraction " . [SEP]
[CLS] lambert continued , " melodic fragments in are completely meaningless themselves . [SEP]
[CLS] they are merely succession ##s of notes that can convenient ##ly be divided into groups of three , five , and seven and set against other mathematical groups " and he described the caden ##za for solo drums as " musical purity . . . achieved by a species of musical cast ##ration " . [SEP]
[CLS] he compared st ##ra ##vinsky ' s choice of " the dr ##ab ##bes ##t and least significant phrases " to gertrude stein ' s ' everyday they were gay there , they were regularly gay there everyday ' ( " helen fur ##r and georg ##ine sk ##een ##e " , 1922 ) , " whose effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of english whatsoever " . [SEP]
[CLS] in his 1949 book " philosophy of modern music " , theodor w . ad ##orno described st ##ra ##vinsky as an ac ##ro ##bat and spoke of he ##be ##ph ##ren ##ic and psychotic traits in several of st ##ra ##vinsky ' s works . [SEP]
[CLS] contrary to a common mis ##con ##ception , ad ##orno didn ' t believe the he ##be ##ph ##ren ##ic and psychotic imitation ##s that the music was supposed to contain were its main fault , as he pointed out in a posts ##cript that he added later to his book . [SEP]
[CLS] ad ##orno ' s criticism of st ##ra ##vinsky is more concerned with the " transition to po ##sit ##ivity " ad ##orno found in his neoclassical works . [SEP]
[CLS] part of the composer ' s error , in ad ##orno ' s view , was his neo ##class ##ici ##sm , but of greater importance was his music ' s " pseudo ##morphism of painting " , playing off ( time - space ) rather than ( time - duration ) of henri berg ##son . [SEP]
[CLS] according to ad ##orno , " one trick character ##izes all of st ##ra ##vinsky ' s formal endeavors : the effort of his music to portray time as in a circus table ##au and to present time complexes as though they were spatial . [SEP]
[CLS] this trick , however , soon exhaust ##s itself " . [SEP]
[CLS] ad ##orno maintained that the " rhythmic procedures closely resemble the sc ##hema of cat ##aton ##ic conditions . [SEP]
[CLS] in certain sc ##hi ##zo ##ph ##ren ##ics , the process by which the motor apparatus becomes independent leads to infinite repetition of gestures or words , following the decay of the ego " . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky ' s reputation in russia and the ussr rose and fell . [SEP]
[CLS] performances of his music were banned from around 1933 until 1962 , the year nikita k ##hr ##ush ##chev invited him to the ussr for an official state visit . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1972 , an official proclamation by the soviet minister of culture , ye ##kat ##erina fur ##ts ##eva , ordered soviet musicians to " study and admire " st ##ra ##vinsky ' s music and she made hostility toward it a potential offence . [SEP]
[CLS] while st ##ra ##vinsky ' s music has been criticized for its range of styles , scholars had " gradually begun to perceive un ##ifying elements in st ##ra ##vinsky ' s music " by the 1980s . [SEP]
[CLS] earlier writers , such as aaron cop ##land , elliott carter , and boris de sc ##hl ##oe ##zer held somewhat un ##fa ##vor ##able views of st ##ra ##vinsky ' s works , and virgil thomson , writing in " modern music " ( a quarterly review published between 1925 and 1946 ) , could find only a common " ' seriousness ' of ' tone ' or of ' purpose ' , ' the exact correlation between the goal and the means ' , or a dry ' ant - like neat ##ness ' " . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky was honored in 1982 by the united states postal service with a 2 ##¢ postage stamp in the great americans series . [SEP]
[CLS] igor st ##ra ##vinsky found recordings a practical and useful tool in preserving his thoughts on the interpretation of his music . [SEP]
[CLS] as a conductor of his own music , he recorded primarily for columbia records , beginning in 1928 with a performance of the original suite from " the fire ##bird " and concluding in 1967 with the 1945 suite from the same ballet . [SEP]

[SEP]
[CLS] during his lifetime , st ##ra ##vinsky appeared on several telecast ##s , including the 1962 world premiere of " the flood " on cbs television . [SEP]
[CLS] although he made an appearance , the actual performance was conducted by robert craft . [SEP]
[CLS] numerous films and videos of the composer have been preserved . [SEP]
[CLS] st ##ra ##vinsky published a number of books throughout his career , almost always with the aid of a ( sometimes uncredited ) collaborator . [SEP]
[CLS] in his 1936 autobiography , " chronicle of my life " , which was written with the help of walter no ##uve ##l , st ##ra ##vinsky included his well - known statement that " music is , by its very nature , essentially powerless to express anything at all " . [SEP]
[CLS] with alexis roland - manuel and pierre so ##u ##v ##tch ##insky , he wrote his 1939 – 40 harvard university charles eliot norton lectures , which were delivered in french and first collected under the title in 1942 and then translated in 1947 as " poetic ##s of music " . [SEP]
