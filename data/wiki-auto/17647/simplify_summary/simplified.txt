laurales is an order of flowering plants .
they are related to the magnoliales .
the order includes about 2500-2800 species from 85-90 genera , which are in seven families of trees and shrubs .
most of the species are tropical and subtropical , though a few genera reach the temperate zone .
the best known species in this order are those of the lauraceaeceaeceaeceae .
the earliest lauraceous fossils are from the lower cretaceous .
it is possible that the ancient origin of this order is one of the reasons for its highly diverged morphology .
indeed , no one morphological property is known , which would unify all the members of laurales .
the presently accepted classification is based on recent molecular and genetic analysis .
the first botanist to think of the laurales as a natural group was h . hallier in 1905 .
he viewed them as being derived from the magnoliales .
during some or all of the 20th century , laurales generally included " amborella " and the plants now classified in austrobaileyales and chloranthaceae .
they were not removed until the advent of molecular data in the late 20th century .
