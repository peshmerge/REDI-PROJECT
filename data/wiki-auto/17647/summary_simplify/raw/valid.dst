The Laurales are an order of flowering plants.
Most of the species are tropical and subtropical, though a few genera reach the temperate zone.
The best known species in this order are those of the Lauraceae (for example bay laurel, cinnamon, avocado, and "Sassafras"), and the ornamental shrub "Calycanthus" of the Calycanthaceae.
It is possible that the ancient origin of this order is one of the reasons for its highly diverged morphology.
Indeed, presently no single morphological property is known, which would unify all the members of Laurales.
During some or all of the 20th century, the Laurales generally included "Amborella" and the plants now classified in Austrobaileyales and Chloranthaceae.
They were not removed until the advent of molecular data in the late 20th century; their previous inclusion made it harder to determine the relationships within the Laurales and between the Laurales and other groups.
