[CLS] the laura ##les are an order of flowering plants . [SEP]
[CLS] most of the species are tropical and subtropical , though a few genera reach the temperate zone . [SEP]
[CLS] the best known species in this order are those of the laura ##ceae ( for example bay laurel , cinnamon , av ##oca ##do , and " sas ##sa ##fra ##s " ) , and the ornamental shrub " cal ##y ##can ##thus " of the cal ##y ##can ##tha ##ceae . [SEP]
[CLS] it is possible that the ancient origin of this order is one of the reasons for its highly diver ##ged morphology . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , presently no single morphological property is known , which would un ##ify all the members of laura ##les . [SEP]
[CLS] during some or all of the 20th century , the laura ##les generally included " am ##bor ##ella " and the plants now classified in austro ##bai ##ley ##ales and ch ##lor ##ant ##ha ##ceae . [SEP]
[CLS] they were not removed until the advent of molecular data in the late 20th century ; their previous inclusion made it harder to determine the relationships within the laura ##les and between the laura ##les and other groups . [SEP]
