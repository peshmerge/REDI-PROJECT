Many biennials require a cold treatment, or vernalization, before they will flower.
During the next spring or summer, the stem of the biennial plant elongates greatly, or "bolts".
The plant then flowers, producing fruits and seeds before it finally dies.
There are far fewer biennials than either perennial plants or annual plants.
Under extreme climatic conditions, a biennial plant may complete its life cycle rapidly (e.g., in three months instead of two years).
This is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were vernalized before they were planted in the ground.
Conversely, an annual grown under extremely favorable conditions may have highly successful seed propagation, giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial.
True biennials flower only once, while many perennials will flower every year once mature.
From a gardener's perspective, a plant's status as annual, biennial, or perennial often varies based on location or purpose.
Plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed, for example, foxglove and stock.
