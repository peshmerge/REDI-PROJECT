[CLS] many biennial ##s require a cold treatment , or ve ##rna ##lization , before they will flower . [SEP]
[CLS] during the next spring or summer , the stem of the biennial plant el ##onga ##tes greatly , or " bolts " . [SEP]
[CLS] the plant then flowers , producing fruits and seeds before it finally dies . [SEP]
[CLS] there are far fewer biennial ##s than either perennial plants or annual plants . [SEP]
[CLS] under extreme climatic conditions , a biennial plant may complete its life cycle rapidly ( e . g . , in three months instead of two years ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this is quite common in vegetable or flower seed ##lings that were ve ##rna ##lized before they were planted in the ground . [SEP]
[CLS] conversely , an annual grown under extremely favorable conditions may have highly successful seed propagation , giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial . [SEP]
[CLS] true biennial ##s flower only once , while many perennial ##s will flower every year once mature . [SEP]
[CLS] from a gardener ' s perspective , a plant ' s status as annual , biennial , or perennial often varies based on location or purpose . [SEP]
[CLS] plant breeders have produced annual cult ##ivar ##s of several biennial ##s that will flower the first year from seed , for example , fox ##gl ##ove and stock . [SEP]
