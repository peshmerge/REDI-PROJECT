many biennials require a cold treatment , before they will flower .
during the next spring or summer , the stem of the biennial plant becomes much longer .
the plant then flowers , producing fruits and seeds before it finally dies .
under extreme climatic conditions , a biennial plant may complete its life cycle rapidly reducing in three months instead of two years imprisonment .
this is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were vernalized before they were planted in the ground .
conversely , an annual grown under extremely good conditions may have highly successful seed propagation , giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial .
true biennials flower only once , while many perennials will flower every year once mature .
from a gardener 's perspective , a plant 's status as annual , biennial , or perennial often varies based on location or purpose .
biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown for just one year .
plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed .
