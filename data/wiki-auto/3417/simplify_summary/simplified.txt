a biennial plant is a flowering plant that takes two years to complete its lifecycle .
in the first year , the plant grows leaves , stems , and rootshesis .
the leaves are usually low to the ground , and usually the rosette remains .
many biennials require a cold treatment , before they will flower .
during the next spring or summer , the stem of the biennial plant becomes much longer .
the plant then flowers , producing fruits and seeds before it finally dies .
there are far fewer biennials than either perennials or annuals .
under extreme climatic conditions , a biennial plant may complete its life cycle rapidly reducing in three months instead of two years imprisonment .
this is quite common in vegetable or flower seedlings that were vernalized before they were planted in the ground .
this behavior leads to many normally biennial plants being treated as annuals in some areas .
conversely , an annual grown under extremely good conditions may have highly successful seed propagation , giving it the appearance of being biennial or perennial .
some short-lived perennials may appear to be biennial rather than perennial .
true biennials flower only once , while many perennials will flower every year once mature .
from a gardener 's perspective , a plant 's status as annual , biennial , or perennial often varies based on location or purpose .
biennials grown for flowers , fruits , or seeds need to be grown for two years .
biennials that are grown for edible leaves or roots are grown for just one year .
examples of biennial plants are leek , parsley , fennel , " lunaria " , silverbeet , sweet william , colic weed , carrot , and some hollyhocks .
plant breeders have produced annual cultivars of several biennials that will flower the first year from seed .
