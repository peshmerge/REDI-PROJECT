[CLS] he took a leading role in the assassination of julius caesar . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus eventually came to oppose caesar and fought on the side of the opt ##imate ##s faction , led by po ##mp ##ey the great , against caesar ' s forces in caesar ' s civil war . [SEP]
[CLS] po ##mp ##ey was defeated at the battle of ph ##ars ##al ##us in 48 bc , after which br ##utus surrendered to caesar , who granted him amnesty . [SEP]
[CLS] they recruited br ##utus , who took a leading role in the assassination , which was carried out successfully on march 15 , 44 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a pop ##uli ##st uprising forced br ##utus and his brother - in - law , fellow assassin gaius cass ##ius long ##inus , to leave the city of rome . [SEP]
[CLS] this led to the li ##ber ##ators ' civil war , pitt ##ing the er ##st ##while supporters of caesar , under the second tri ##um ##vira ##te , wishing both to gain power for themselves and avenge his death , against those who opposed him . [SEP]
[CLS] oct ##avian combined his troops with those of antony , and together they decisive ##ly defeated the outnumbered armies of br ##utus and cass ##ius at the battle of philipp ##i in october 42 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] his name has since become synonymous with acts of intimate public betrayal or treason , and is perhaps only rival ##ed in this regard by the name of judas . [SEP]
[CLS] his ancestor , lucius jun ##ius br ##utus , helped to overthrow the et ##rus ##can king of rome , and was dubbed " the founder of the roman republic " by the romans . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus ' father was killed by po ##mp ##ey the great in dubious circumstances after he had taken part in the rebellion of le ##pid ##us ; his mother was the half - sister of cat ##o the younger , and later julius caesar ' s mistress . [SEP]
[CLS] some sources refer to the possibility of caesar being his real father , despite caesar ' s being only 15 years old when br ##utus was born . [SEP]
[CLS] following caesar ' s assassination in 44 bc , br ##utus revived his adoptive name in order to illustrate his links to another famous ty ##ran ##nic ##ide , gaius ser ##vili ##us ah ##ala , from whom he was descended . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus held his uncle in high regard and his political career started when he became an assistant to cat ##o , during his governors ##hip of cyprus . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus was also active in the province of ci ##lic ##ia , in the year before marcus tu ##lli ##us cicero was pro ##con ##sul there ; cicero documents how br ##utus profit ##ed from money lending to the provincial ##s in his " letters " . [SEP]
[CLS] from his first appearance in the senate , br ##utus aligned with the opt ##imate ##s ( the conservative faction ) against the first tri ##um ##vira ##te of marcus li ##cini ##us cr ##ass ##us , g ##nae ##us po ##mp ##ei ##us magnus , and gaius julius caesar . [SEP]
[CLS] when caesar ' s civil war broke out in 49 bc between po ##mp ##ey and caesar , br ##utus followed his old enemy and the present leader of the opt ##imate ##s , po ##mp ##ey . [SEP]
[CLS] when the battle of ph ##ars ##al ##us began on august 9 , caesar ordered his officers to take br ##utus prisoner if he gave himself up voluntarily , but to leave him alone and do him no harm if he persisted in fighting against capture . [SEP]
[CLS] caesar ' s concern , given that he and br ##utus ' mother ser ##vili ##a had been lovers in their youth , was that br ##utus might be his biological son . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , he and br ##utus enjoyed a close relationship at this time . [SEP]
[CLS] even when br ##utus joined po ##mp ##ey the great to fight with caesar and his soldiers , caesar ' s main focus was po ##mp ##ey , but he demanded br ##utus be captured alive . [SEP]
[CLS] after the defeat of the opt ##imate ##s at the battle of ph ##ars ##al ##us , br ##utus surrendered and wrote to caesar with apologies . [SEP]
[CLS] caesar then accepted him into his inner circle and made him governor of gaul when he left for africa in pursuit of cat ##o and met ##ell ##us sci ##pio . [SEP]
[CLS] in 45 bc , caesar nominated br ##utus to serve as urban pr ##ae ##tor for the following year . [SEP]
[CLS] the marriage also caused a rift between br ##utus and his mother , who was res ##ent ##ful of the affection br ##utus had for por ##cia . [SEP]
[CLS] on that day , caesar was delayed going to the senate because his wife cal ##pur ##nia tried to convince him not to go . [SEP]
[CLS] the con ##sp ##ira ##tors feared the plot had been found out . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus persisted , however , waiting for caesar at the senate , and allegedly still chose to remain even when a messenger brought him news that would otherwise have caused him to leave . [SEP]
[CLS] when caesar finally did come to the senate , he was distracted by till ##ius ci ##mber , who presented caesar with a request to free his exiled brother . [SEP]
[CLS] however , upon seeing br ##utus was with the con ##sp ##ira ##tors , caesar covered his face with his to ##ga and resigned himself to his fate . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , up ##ro ##ar among the population against the assassins caused br ##utus and the con ##sp ##ira ##tors to leave rome . [SEP]
[CLS] in 43 bc , after oct ##avian received his consul ##ship from the roman senate , one of his first actions was to have the people who had assassinated julius caesar declared murderers and enemies of the state . [SEP]
[CLS] cicero , angry at oct ##avian , wrote a letter to br ##utus explaining that the forces of oct ##avian and mark antony were divided . [SEP]
[CLS] antony had laid siege to the province of gaul , where he wanted a governors ##hip . [SEP]
[CLS] in response to this siege , oct ##avian rallied his troops and fought a series of battles , culminating in the battle of mu ##tina , in which antony was defeated . [SEP]
[CLS] upon hearing that neither mark antony nor oct ##avian had an army large enough to defend rome , br ##utus rallied his troops , which total ##led about 17 legions . [SEP]
[CLS] their armies , which together total ##led about 19 legions , marched to meet br ##utus and his ally , fellow assassin gaius cass ##ius long ##inus , thus beginning the li ##ber ##ators ' civil war . [SEP]
[CLS] knowing his army had been defeated and that he would be captured , br ##utus committed suicide by running into his own sword being held by two of his own men . [SEP]
[CLS] among his last words were , according to pl ##uta ##rch , " by all means must we fly ; not with our feet , however , but with our hands " . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus also uttered the well - known verse calling down a curse upon antony ( pl ##uta ##rch repeats this from the memoirs of pub ##lius vol ##um ##nius ) : " forget not , zeus , the author of these crimes " ( in the dry ##den translation this passage is given as " punish , great jo ##ve , the author of these ill ##s " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] mark antony , as a show of great respect , ordered br ##utus ' body to be wrapped in antony ' s most expensive purple mantle ( this was later stolen , and antony had the thief executed ) . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus was cremated , and his ashes were sent to his mother , ser ##vili ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] his wife por ##cia was reported to have committed suicide upon hearing of her husband ' s death , although , according to pl ##uta ##rch ( br ##utus 53 para 2 ) , there is some dispute as to whether this is the case : pl ##uta ##rch states that there was a letter in existence that was allegedly written by br ##utus mourning the manner of her death . [SEP]
[CLS] on the night of the assassination , booth is alleged to have shouted " sic se ##mp ##er ty ##ran ##nis " while leaping to the stage of ford ' s theater . [SEP]
[CLS] lame ##nting the negative reaction to his deed , booth wrote in his journal on april 21 , 1865 , while on the run , " with every man ' s hand against me , i am here in despair . [SEP]
[CLS] booth was also known to be greatly attracted to caesar himself , having played both br ##utus and caesar upon various stages . [SEP]
