[CLS] marcus jun ##ius br ##utus ( the younger ) ( ; 85 bc â€“ 23 october 42 bc ) , often referred to as br ##utus , was a roman politician during the political turmoil of the late roman republic . [SEP]
[CLS] after being adopted by his uncle , qui ##nt ##us ser ##vili ##us ca ##ep ##io , he used the name qui ##nt ##us ser ##vili ##us ca ##ep ##io br ##utus , but eventually returned to using his original name . [SEP]
[CLS] he took a leading role in the assassination of julius caesar . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus was close to general julius caesar , the leader of the popular ##es faction . [SEP]
[CLS] however , caesar ' s attempts to assume greater power for himself put him at greater odds with the roman elite and members of the senate . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus eventually came to oppose caesar and fought on the side of the opt ##imate ##s faction , led by po ##mp ##ey the great , against caesar ' s forces in caesar ' s civil war . [SEP]
[CLS] po ##mp ##ey was defeated at the battle of ph ##ars ##al ##us in 48 bc , after which br ##utus surrendered to caesar , who granted him amnesty . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the underlying political tensions that led to the war had not been resolved . [SEP]
[CLS] due to caesar ' s increasingly monarch ##ical behavior , several senators , calling themselves " li ##ber ##ators " , plotted to assassinate him . [SEP]
[CLS] they recruited br ##utus , who took a leading role in the assassination , which was carried out successfully on march 15 , 44 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] the senate , at the request of the consul mark antony , granted amnesty to the assassins . [SEP]
[CLS] however , a pop ##uli ##st uprising forced br ##utus and his brother - in - law , fellow assassin gaius cass ##ius long ##inus , to leave the city of rome . [SEP]
[CLS] in 43 bc , caesar ' s grand ##ne ##ph ##ew , consul oct ##avian , by then also formally known as gaius julius caesar , immediately after taking office passed a resolution declaring the con ##sp ##ira ##tors , including br ##utus , murderers . [SEP]
[CLS] this led to the li ##ber ##ators ' civil war , pitt ##ing the er ##st ##while supporters of caesar , under the second tri ##um ##vira ##te , wishing both to gain power for themselves and avenge his death , against those who opposed him . [SEP]
[CLS] oct ##avian combined his troops with those of antony , and together they decisive ##ly defeated the outnumbered armies of br ##utus and cass ##ius at the battle of philipp ##i in october 42 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] after the battle , br ##utus committed suicide . [SEP]
[CLS] his name has since become synonymous with acts of intimate public betrayal or treason , and is perhaps only rival ##ed in this regard by the name of judas . [SEP]
[CLS] marcus jun ##ius br ##utus minor ( ] ) was the son of marcus jun ##ius br ##utus mai ##or and ser ##vili ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] he was a member of the gen ##s jun ##ia , one of the most celebrated families in rome . [SEP]
[CLS] his ancestor , lucius jun ##ius br ##utus , helped to overthrow the et ##rus ##can king of rome , and was dubbed " the founder of the roman republic " by the romans . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus ' father was killed by po ##mp ##ey the great in dubious circumstances after he had taken part in the rebellion of le ##pid ##us ; his mother was the half - sister of cat ##o the younger , and later julius caesar ' s mistress . [SEP]
[CLS] some sources refer to the possibility of caesar being his real father , despite caesar ' s being only 15 years old when br ##utus was born . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus ' uncle , qui ##nt ##us ser ##vili ##us ca ##ep ##io , adopted him posthumously in about 59 bc , and br ##utus was known officially for a time as qui ##nt ##us ser ##vili ##us ca ##ep ##io br ##utus before he reverted to using his birth - name . [SEP]
[CLS] following caesar ' s assassination in 44 bc , br ##utus revived his adoptive name in order to illustrate his links to another famous ty ##ran ##nic ##ide , gaius ser ##vili ##us ah ##ala , from whom he was descended . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus held his uncle in high regard and his political career started when he became an assistant to cat ##o , during his governors ##hip of cyprus . [SEP]
[CLS] during this time , he enriched himself by lending money at high rates of interest . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus was also active in the province of ci ##lic ##ia , in the year before marcus tu ##lli ##us cicero was pro ##con ##sul there ; cicero documents how br ##utus profit ##ed from money lending to the provincial ##s in his " letters " . [SEP]
[CLS] he returned to rome a rich man , where he married claudia pu ##lch ##ra . [SEP]
[CLS] from his first appearance in the senate , br ##utus aligned with the opt ##imate ##s ( the conservative faction ) against the first tri ##um ##vira ##te of marcus li ##cini ##us cr ##ass ##us , g ##nae ##us po ##mp ##ei ##us magnus , and gaius julius caesar . [SEP]
[CLS] when caesar ' s civil war broke out in 49 bc between po ##mp ##ey and caesar , br ##utus followed his old enemy and the present leader of the opt ##imate ##s , po ##mp ##ey . [SEP]
[CLS] when the battle of ph ##ars ##al ##us began on august 9 , caesar ordered his officers to take br ##utus prisoner if he gave himself up voluntarily , but to leave him alone and do him no harm if he persisted in fighting against capture . [SEP]
[CLS] caesar ' s concern , given that he and br ##utus ' mother ser ##vili ##a had been lovers in their youth , was that br ##utus might be his biological son . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , he and br ##utus enjoyed a close relationship at this time . [SEP]
[CLS] even when br ##utus joined po ##mp ##ey the great to fight with caesar and his soldiers , caesar ' s main focus was po ##mp ##ey , but he demanded br ##utus be captured alive . [SEP]
[CLS] after the defeat of the opt ##imate ##s at the battle of ph ##ars ##al ##us , br ##utus surrendered and wrote to caesar with apologies . [SEP]
[CLS] caesar immediately for ##ga ##ve him . [SEP]
[CLS] caesar then accepted him into his inner circle and made him governor of gaul when he left for africa in pursuit of cat ##o and met ##ell ##us sci ##pio . [SEP]
[CLS] in 45 bc , caesar nominated br ##utus to serve as urban pr ##ae ##tor for the following year . [SEP]
[CLS] also , in june 45 bc , br ##utus divorced his wife and married his first cousin , por ##cia cat ##onis , cat ##o ' s daughter . [SEP]
[CLS] according to cicero the marriage caused a semi - scandal as br ##utus failed to state a valid reason for his divorce from claudia other than he wished to marry por ##cia . [SEP]
[CLS] the marriage also caused a rift between br ##utus and his mother , who was res ##ent ##ful of the affection br ##utus had for por ##cia . [SEP]
[CLS] around this time many senators began to fear caesar ' s growing power , following his appointment as dictator in per ##pet ##uity . [SEP]
[CLS] the other senators persuaded br ##utus to join the conspiracy against caesar . [SEP]
[CLS] eventually , br ##utus decided to move against caesar after caesar ' s alleged king - like behavior prompted him to take action . [SEP]
[CLS] his wife was the only woman privy to the plot . [SEP]
[CLS] the con ##sp ##ira ##tors planned to carry out their plot on the id ##es of march ( march 15 ) that same year . [SEP]
[CLS] on that day , caesar was delayed going to the senate because his wife cal ##pur ##nia tried to convince him not to go . [SEP]
[CLS] the con ##sp ##ira ##tors feared the plot had been found out . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus persisted , however , waiting for caesar at the senate , and allegedly still chose to remain even when a messenger brought him news that would otherwise have caused him to leave . [SEP]
[CLS] when caesar finally did come to the senate , he was distracted by till ##ius ci ##mber , who presented caesar with a request to free his exiled brother . [SEP]
[CLS] caesar dismissed him , and ci ##mber subsequently grabbed his to ##ga . [SEP]
[CLS] at this , the con ##sp ##ira ##tors attacked caesar . [SEP]
[CLS] pub ##lius ser ##vili ##us cas ##ca long ##us was allegedly the first to attack him , with a stab to the shoulder , which caesar blocked . [SEP]
[CLS] however , upon seeing br ##utus was with the con ##sp ##ira ##tors , caesar covered his face with his to ##ga and resigned himself to his fate . [SEP]
[CLS] the con ##sp ##ira ##tors attacked in such numbers that they even wounded one another . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus is said to have been wounded in the hand and in the legs . [SEP]
[CLS] after the assassination , the senate passed an amnesty on the assassins . [SEP]
[CLS] this amnesty was proposed by caesar ' s friend and co - consul mark antony . [SEP]
[CLS] nonetheless , up ##ro ##ar among the population against the assassins caused br ##utus and the con ##sp ##ira ##tors to leave rome . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus settled in crete from 44 to 42 bc . [SEP]
[CLS] in 43 bc , after oct ##avian received his consul ##ship from the roman senate , one of his first actions was to have the people who had assassinated julius caesar declared murderers and enemies of the state . [SEP]
[CLS] cicero , angry at oct ##avian , wrote a letter to br ##utus explaining that the forces of oct ##avian and mark antony were divided . [SEP]
[CLS] antony had laid siege to the province of gaul , where he wanted a governors ##hip . [SEP]
[CLS] in response to this siege , oct ##avian rallied his troops and fought a series of battles , culminating in the battle of mu ##tina , in which antony was defeated . [SEP]
[CLS] upon hearing that neither mark antony nor oct ##avian had an army large enough to defend rome , br ##utus rallied his troops , which total ##led about 17 legions . [SEP]
[CLS] when oct ##avian heard that br ##utus was on his way to rome , he made peace with antony . [SEP]
[CLS] their armies , which together total ##led about 19 legions , marched to meet br ##utus and his ally , fellow assassin gaius cass ##ius long ##inus , thus beginning the li ##ber ##ators ' civil war . [SEP]
[CLS] the two sides met in two engagements known as the battle of philipp ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] the first was fought on october 3 , 42 bc , in which br ##utus defeated oct ##avian ' s forces , although cass ##ius was defeated by antony ' s forces , and subsequently committed suicide . [SEP]
[CLS] the second engagement was fought on october 23 , and ended in br ##utus ' defeat . [SEP]
[CLS] after the defeat , he fled into the nearby hills with only about four legions . [SEP]
[CLS] knowing his army had been defeated and that he would be captured , br ##utus committed suicide by running into his own sword being held by two of his own men . [SEP]
[CLS] among his last words were , according to pl ##uta ##rch , " by all means must we fly ; not with our feet , however , but with our hands " . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus also uttered the well - known verse calling down a curse upon antony ( pl ##uta ##rch repeats this from the memoirs of pub ##lius vol ##um ##nius ) : " forget not , zeus , the author of these crimes " ( in the dry ##den translation this passage is given as " punish , great jo ##ve , the author of these ill ##s " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] pl ##uta ##rch wrote that , according to vol ##um ##nius , br ##utus repeated two verses , but vol ##um ##nius was only able to recall the one quoted . [SEP]
[CLS] mark antony , as a show of great respect , ordered br ##utus ' body to be wrapped in antony ' s most expensive purple mantle ( this was later stolen , and antony had the thief executed ) . [SEP]
[CLS] br ##utus was cremated , and his ashes were sent to his mother , ser ##vili ##a . [SEP]
[CLS] his wife por ##cia was reported to have committed suicide upon hearing of her husband ' s death , although , according to pl ##uta ##rch ( br ##utus 53 para 2 ) , there is some dispute as to whether this is the case : pl ##uta ##rch states that there was a letter in existence that was allegedly written by br ##utus mourning the manner of her death . [SEP]
[CLS] the phrase " sic se ##mp ##er ty ##ran ##nis ! " [SEP]
[CLS] " thus , ever ( or always ) , to tyrant ##s ! " [SEP]
[CLS] is attributed to br ##utus at caesar ' s assassination . [SEP]
[CLS] the phrase is also the official motto of the commonwealth of virginia . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1787 , the anti - federal ##ist papers were written under the pseudonym " br ##utus " in reference to caesar ' s assassin who tried to preserve the republic . [SEP]
[CLS] john wilkes booth , the assassin of abraham lincoln , claimed to be inspired by br ##utus . [SEP]
[CLS] booth ' s father , jun ##ius br ##utus booth , was named for br ##utus , and booth ( as mark antony ) and his brother edwin ( as br ##utus ) had performed in a production of " julius caesar " in new york city just six months before the assassination . [SEP]
[CLS] on the night of the assassination , booth is alleged to have shouted " sic se ##mp ##er ty ##ran ##nis " while leaping to the stage of ford ' s theater . [SEP]
[CLS] lame ##nting the negative reaction to his deed , booth wrote in his journal on april 21 , 1865 , while on the run , " with every man ' s hand against me , i am here in despair . [SEP]
[CLS] and why ; for doing what br ##utus was honored for . . . and yet i for striking down a greater tyrant than they ever knew am looked upon as a common cut ##th ##ro ##at . " [SEP]
[CLS] booth was also known to be greatly attracted to caesar himself , having played both br ##utus and caesar upon various stages . [SEP]
