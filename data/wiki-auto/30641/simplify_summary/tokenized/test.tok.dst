[CLS] " the black cat " is a short story by american writer edgar allan poe . [SEP]
[CLS] it was first published in the august 19 , 1843 , edition of " the saturday evening post " . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a study of the psychology of guilt , often paired in analysis with poe ' s " the tell - tale heart " . [SEP]
[CLS] in both , a murderer carefully conceal ##s his crime and believes himself una ##ssa ##ila ##ble , but eventually breaks down and reveals himself , imp ##elled by a na ##gging reminder of his guilt . [SEP]
[CLS] the story is presented as a first - person narrative using an unreliable narrator . [SEP]
[CLS] he is a condemned man at the outset of the story . [SEP]
[CLS] the narrator tells us that from an early age he has loved animals ; he and his wife have many pets , including a large , beautiful black cat ( as described by the narrator ) named pluto . [SEP]
[CLS] this cat is especially fond of the narrator and vice versa . [SEP]
[CLS] their mutual friendship lasts for several years until the narrator becomes an alcoholic . [SEP]
[CLS] one night , after coming home completely into ##xi ##cated , he believes the cat to be avoiding him . [SEP]
[CLS] when he tries to seize it , the panicked cat bites the narrator , and in a fit of drunken rage he seize ##s the animal , pulls a pen - knife from his pocket , and deliberately go ##uge ##s out the cat ' s eye . [SEP]
[CLS] from that moment on , the cat flees in terror at his master ' s approach . [SEP]
[CLS] at first , the narrator is remorse ##ful and regrets his cruelty . [SEP]
[CLS] " but this feeling soon gave place to irritation . [SEP]
[CLS] and then came , as if to my final and ir ##re ##vo ##cable overthrow , the spirit of per ##verse ##ness . " [SEP]
[CLS] in another fit of drunken fury , the narrator takes the cat out in the garden one morning and ties a no ##ose around its neck , hanging it from a tree where it dies . [SEP]
[CLS] that very night his house mysteriously catches fire , forcing the narrator , his wife and their servant to flee the premises . [SEP]
[CLS] the next day , the narrator returns to the ruins of his home to find , imprint ##ed on the single wall that survived the fire , the app ##ari ##tion of a gigantic cat with a rope around the animal ' s neck . [SEP]
[CLS] at first , this image deeply disturb ##s the narrator , but gradually he determines a logical explanation for it ; someone outside had cut the cat from the tree and thrown its corpse into the bedroom to wake him during the fire . [SEP]
[CLS] the narrator begins to miss pluto and hate himself for his actions , feeling guilty . [SEP]
[CLS] some time later , he finds a similar cat in a tavern . [SEP]
[CLS] it is the same size and color as the original and is even missing an eye . [SEP]
[CLS] the only difference is a large white patch on the animal ' s chest . [SEP]
[CLS] the narrator takes it home , but soon begins to fear and lo ##ath ##e the creature , due to the fact that it amp ##li ##fies his feeling of guilt . [SEP]
[CLS] after a time , the white patch of fur begins to take shape and , much to the narrator ' s horror , forms the shape of the gallo ##ws . [SEP]
[CLS] this terri ##fies and anger ##s him more , and he avoids the cat whenever possible . [SEP]
[CLS] then , one day when the narrator and his wife are visiting the cellar in their new home , the cat gets under its master ' s feet and nearly trips him down the stairs . [SEP]
[CLS] his rage amplified by alcohol , the man grabs an axe and tries to kill the cat but is stopped by his wife . [SEP]
[CLS] being unable to take out his drunken fury on the cat , he accidentally kills his wife instead . [SEP]
[CLS] to conceal her body he removes bricks from a pro ##tr ##usion in the wall , places her body there , and repairs the hole . [SEP]
[CLS] a few days later , when the police show up at the house to investigate the wife ' s disappearance , they find nothing and the narrator goes free . [SEP]
[CLS] the cat , which he intended to kill as well , has also gone missing . [SEP]
[CLS] this grants him the freedom to sleep , even with the burden of murder . [SEP]
[CLS] on the last day of the investigation , the narrator acc ##omp ##anies the police into the cellar . [SEP]
[CLS] they still find nothing significant . [SEP]
[CLS] then , completely confident in his own safety , the narrator comments on the stu ##rdi ##ness of the building and rap ##s upon the wall he had built around his wife ' s body . [SEP]
[CLS] a loud , inhuman wai ##ling sound fills the room . [SEP]
[CLS] the alarmed police tear down the wall and find the wife ' s corpse . [SEP]
[CLS] sitting on the corpse ' s rotting head , to the utter horror of the narrator , is the sc ##ree ##ching black cat . [SEP]
[CLS] the terrified narrator is immediately shattered completely by this reminder of his crime , which he had believed to be safe from discovery , and the appearance of the cat . [SEP]
[CLS] as he words it : " i had walled the monster up within the tomb ! " [SEP]
[CLS] " the black cat " was first published in the august 19 , 1843 , issue of " the saturday evening post " . [SEP]
[CLS] at the time , the publication was using the temporary title " united states saturday post " . [SEP]
[CLS] readers immediately responded favorably to the story , spawning par ##odies including thomas dunn english ' s " the ghost of the grey tad ##pole " . [SEP]
[CLS] like the narrator in poe ' s " the tell - tale heart " , the narrator of " the black cat " has questionable sanity . [SEP]
[CLS] in the beginning of the tale , the narrator says the reader would be " mad indeed " if the reader should expect a reader to believe the story , implying that he has already been accused of madness . [SEP]
[CLS] the extent to which the narrator claims to have loved his animals suggests mental instability in the form of having “ too much of a good thing ” . [SEP]
[CLS] his partial ##ity for animals substitutes “ the pal ##try friendship and go ##ssa ##mer fidelity of mere man ” . [SEP]
[CLS] since the narrator ' s wife shares his love of animals , he likely thinks of her as another pet , seeing as he distrust ##s and dislike ##s humans . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , his failure to understand his excessive love of animals fore ##sha ##do ##ws his inability to explain his motives for his actions . [SEP]
[CLS] one of poe ' s darkest tales , " the black cat " includes his strongest den ##unciation of alcohol . [SEP]
[CLS] the narrator ' s per ##verse actions are brought on by his alcoholism , a " disease " and " fi ##end " which also destroys his personality . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of the black cat ev ##oke ##s various super ##sti ##tions , including the idea voiced by the narrator ' s wife that they are all witches in disguise . [SEP]
[CLS] poe owned a black cat . [SEP]
[CLS] in his " instinct vs reason - - a black cat " he stated : " the writer of this article is the owner of one of the most remarkable black cats in the world - and this is saying much ; for it will be remembered that black cats are all of them witches . " [SEP]
[CLS] in scottish and irish mythology , the cat sit ##h is described as being a black cat with a white spot on its chest , not unlike the cat the narrator finds in the tavern . [SEP]
[CLS] the titular cat in the poem is named pluto after the roman god of the underworld . [SEP]
[CLS] although pluto is a neutral character at the beginning of the story , he becomes antagonist ##ic in the narrator ' s eyes once the narrator becomes an alcoholic . [SEP]
[CLS] the alcohol pushes the narrator into fits of int ##em ##per ##ance and violence , to the point at which everything anger ##s him – pluto in particular , who is always by his side , becomes the male ##vo ##lent witch who haunt ##s him even while avoiding his presence . [SEP]
[CLS] when the narrator cuts pluto ' s eye from its socket , this can be seen as symbolic of self - inflicted partial blindness to his own vision of moral goodness . [SEP]
[CLS] the fire that destroys the narrator ' s house symbol ##izes the narrator ' s " almost complete moral di ##sin ##te ##gration " . [SEP]
[CLS] the only remainder is the impression of pluto upon the wall , which represents his un ##for ##gi ##vable and inc ##or ##ri ##gible sin . [SEP]
[CLS] from a rhetoric ##ian ' s stand ##point , an effective scheme of om ##iss ##ion that poe employs is diaz ##eu ##gm ##a , or using many verbs for one subject ; it om ##its pronouns . [SEP]
[CLS] diaz ##eu ##gm ##a emphasizes actions and makes the narrative swift and brief . [SEP]
