[CLS] k ##2 , also known as mount god ##win - austen or ch ##hog ##ori , at 8 , 61 ##1 metres ( 28 , 251 ft ) above sea level , is the second highest mountain in the world , after mount everest at 8 , 84 ##8 metres ( 29 , 02 ##9 ft ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it is located on the china – pakistan border between bal ##tist ##an in the gil ##git - bal ##tist ##an region of northern pakistan , and the tax ##kor ##gan ta ##ji ##k autonomous county of xinjiang , china . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##2 is the highest point of the kara ##kor ##am range and the highest point in both pakistan and xinjiang . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##2 is known as the " savage mountain " after george bell , a climb ##er on the 1953 american expedition , told reporters " it ' s a savage mountain that tries to kill you . " [SEP]
[CLS] of the five highest mountains in the world , k ##2 is the dead ##liest where approximately one person dies on the mountain for every four who reach the summit . [SEP]
[CLS] other names for k ##2 are the king of mountains and the mountain ##eers ' mountain . , as well as the mountain of mountains after climb ##er rein ##hold mess ##ner titled his book about k ##2 the same . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##2 is the only eight thousand meter peak that has never been climbed during winter or from its east face . [SEP]
[CLS] ascent ##s have almost always been made in july and august , the warm ##est times of year ; k ##2 ' s more northern location makes it more susceptible to inc ##lem ##ent and colder weather . [SEP]
[CLS] the peak has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges . [SEP]
[CLS] although the summit of everest is at a higher altitude , k ##2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb , due in part to its more inc ##lem ##ent weather and comparatively greater height from base to peak . [SEP]
[CLS] s of 2018 , only 36 ##7 people have completed the ascent . [SEP]
[CLS] 86 people have died attempting the climb according to the list maintained on the list of deaths on eight - thousand ##ers . [SEP]
[CLS] the summit was reached for the first time by the italian climb ##ers lin ##o laced ##elli and ac ##hill ##e com ##pa ##gnon ##i , on the 1954 italian kara ##kor ##am expedition led by ar ##dit ##o des ##io . [SEP]
[CLS] the name k ##2 is derived from the notation used by the great tri ##gon ##ometric ##al survey of british india . [SEP]
[CLS] thomas mont ##go ##merie made the first survey of the kara ##kor ##am from mount hara ##mu ##kh , some 130 mi to the south , and sketch ##ed the two most prominent peaks , labeling them k ##1 and k ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] the policy of the great tri ##gon ##ometric ##al survey was to use local names for mountains wherever possible and k ##1 was found to be known locally as mas ##her ##br ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##2 , however , appeared not to have acquired a local name , possibly due to its remote ##ness . [SEP]
[CLS] the mountain is not visible from ask ##ole , the last village to the south , or from the nearest habitat ##ion to the north , and is only fleeting ##ly glimpse ##d from the end of the bal ##tor ##o glacier , beyond which few local people would have ventured . [SEP]
[CLS] the name " cho ##gor ##i " , derived from two bal ##ti words , " ch ##hog ##o " ( " big " ) and " ri " ( " mountain " ) ( چ ##ھ ##و ##غ ##و ##ر ##ی ) has been suggested as a local name , but evidence for its widespread use is scan ##t . [SEP]
[CLS] it may have been a compound name invented by western explorers or simply a be ##mus ##ed reply to the question " what ' s that called ? " [SEP]
[CLS] it does , however , form the basis for the name " q ##og ##ir " by which chinese authorities officially refer to the peak . [SEP]
[CLS] other local names have been suggested including " lamb ##a pa ##har " ( " tall mountain " in urdu ) and " da ##ps ##ang " , but are not widely used . [SEP]
[CLS] with the mountain lacking a local name , the name " mount god ##win - austen " was suggested , in honor of henry god ##win - austen , an early explorer of the area . [SEP]
[CLS] while the name was rejected by the royal geographical society , it was used on several maps and continues to be used occasionally . [SEP]
[CLS] the surveyor ' s mark , k ##2 , therefore continues to be the name by which the mountain is commonly known . [SEP]
[CLS] it is now also used in the bal ##ti language , rendered as " ke ##chu " or " ke ##tu " . [SEP]
[CLS] the italian climb ##er f ##os ##co mara ##ini argued in his account of the ascent of gas ##her ##br ##um iv that while the name of k ##2 owes its origin to chance , its clipped , imp ##erson ##al nature is highly appropriate for so remote and challenging a mountain . [SEP]
[CLS] andre wei ##l named k ##3 surfaces in mathematics partly after the beauty of the mountain k ##2 . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##2 lies in the northwestern kara ##kor ##am range . [SEP]
[CLS] it is located in the bal ##tist ##an region of gil ##git – bal ##tist ##an , pakistan , and the tax ##kor ##gan ta ##ji ##k autonomous county of xinjiang , china . [SEP]
[CLS] the tar ##im sedimentary basin borders the range on the north and the lesser himalayas on the south . [SEP]
[CLS] melt waters from vast glaciers , such as those south and east of k ##2 , feed agriculture in the valleys and contribute significantly to the regional fresh - water supply . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##2 is ranked 22nd by topographic prominence , a measure of a mountain ' s independent stature , because it is part of the same extended area of up ##lift ( including the kara ##kor ##am , the tibetan plateau , and the him ##ala ##ya ) as mount everest , in that it is possible to follow a path from k ##2 to everest that goes no lower than 45 ##9 ##4 m , at the ko ##ra la on the nepal / china border in the mustang lo . [SEP]
[CLS] many other peaks that are far lower than k ##2 are more independent in this sense . [SEP]
[CLS] it is , however , the most prominent peak within the kara ##kor ##am range . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##2 is notable for its local relief as well as its total height . [SEP]
[CLS] it stands over 3000 m above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a consistently steep pyramid , dropping quickly in almost all directions . [SEP]
[CLS] the north side is the steep ##est : there it rises over 320 ##0 m above the k ##2 ( q ##og ##ir ) glacier in only 3000 m of horizontal distance . [SEP]
[CLS] in most directions , it achieve ##s over 280 ##0 m of vertical relief in less than 4000 m . [SEP]
[CLS] a 1986 expedition led by george waller ##stein made an inaccurate measurement incorrectly showing that k ##2 was taller than mount everest , and therefore the tallest mountain in the world . [SEP]
[CLS] a corrected measurement was made in 1987 , but by then the claim that k ##2 was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works . [SEP]
[CLS] the mountains of k ##2 and broad peak , and the area westward to the lower reaches of sar ##po la ##gg ##o glacier consist of meta ##morphic rocks , known as the " k ##2 g ##ne ##iss " and part of the kara ##kor ##am meta ##morphic complex . [SEP]
[CLS] the k ##2 g ##ne ##iss consists of a mixture of or ##th ##og ##ne ##iss and bio ##tite - rich para ##gne ##iss . [SEP]
[CLS] on the south and southeast face of k ##2 , the or ##th ##og ##ne ##iss consists of a mixture of a strongly f ##oli ##ated pl ##agi ##oc ##lase - horn ##ble ##nde g ##ne ##iss and a bio ##tite - horn ##ble ##nde - k - fe ##ld ##spar or ##th ##og ##ne ##iss , which has been int ##rud ##ed by ga ##rnet - mic ##a le ##uc ##og ##rani ##tic di ##kes . [SEP]
[CLS] in places , the para ##gne ##isse ##s include cl ##ino ##py ##ro ##x ##ene - horn ##ble ##nde - bearing ps ##am ##mite ##s , ga ##rnet ( gross ##ular ) - di ##ops ##ide marble ##s , and bio ##tite - graph ##ite ph ##yl ##lite ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] near the memorial to the climb ##ers , who have died on k ##2 , above base camp on the south spur , thin imp ##ure marble ##s with quartz ##ites and mic ##a sc ##his ##ts , called the " gil ##key - pu ##cho ##z sequence " , are inter ##band ##ed within the or ##th ##og ##ne ##isse ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] on the west face of broad peak and south spur of k ##2 , lamp ##rop ##hy ##re di ##kes , which consist of cl ##ino ##py ##ro ##x ##ene and bio ##tite - por ##phy ##rit ##ic vo ##ges ##ites and mine ##ttes , have int ##rud ##ed the k ##2 g ##ne ##iss . [SEP]
[CLS] the k ##2 g ##ne ##iss is separated from the surrounding sedimentary and meta ##sed ##ime ##nta ##ry rocks of the surrounding kara ##kor ##am meta ##morphic complex by normal faults . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , a fault separates the k ##2 g ##ne ##iss of the east face of k ##2 from limestone ##s and slate ##s comprising nearby sky ##ang kang ##ri . [SEP]
[CLS] ar / ar ages of 115 to 120 million years ago obtained from and geo ##chemical analyses of the k ##2 g ##ne ##iss demonstrate that it is a meta ##mo ##rp ##hos ##ed , older , cretaceous , pre - collision ##al granite . [SEP]
[CLS] the gran ##itic precursor ( proto ##lit ##h ) to the k ##2 g ##ne ##iss originated as the result of the production of large bodies of magma by a northward - dipping sub ##duction zone along what was the continental margin of asia at that time and their intrusion as bath ##oli ##ths into its lower continental crust . [SEP]
[CLS] during the initial collision of the asia and indian plates , this gran ##itic bath ##oli ##th was buried to depths of about 20 km or more , highly meta ##mo ##rp ##hos ##ed , highly def ##or ##med , and partially re ##mel ##ted during the e ##ocene period to form g ##ne ##iss . [SEP]
[CLS] later , the k ##2 g ##ne ##iss was then int ##rud ##ed by le ##uc ##og ##rani ##te di ##kes and finally ex ##hum ##ed and up ##lift ##ed along major break ##back thrust faults during post - miocene time . [SEP]
[CLS] the k ##2 g ##ne ##iss was exposed as the entire k ##2 - broad peak - gas ##her ##br ##um range experienced rapid up ##lift with which erosion rates have been unable to keep pace . [SEP]
[CLS] the mountain was first surveyed by a european survey team in 1856 . [SEP]
[CLS] team member thomas mont ##go ##merie designated the mountain " k ##2 " for being the second peak of the kara ##kor ##am range . [SEP]
[CLS] the other peaks were originally named k ##1 , k ##3 , k ##4 , and k ##5 , but were eventually renamed mas ##her ##br ##um , gas ##her ##br ##um iv , gas ##her ##br ##um ii , and gas ##her ##br ##um i , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1892 , martin conway led a british expedition that reached " concordia " on the bal ##tor ##o glacier . [SEP]
[CLS] the first serious attempt to climb k ##2 was undertaken in 1902 by oscar ec ##ken ##stein , ale ##ister crowley , jules ja ##cot - gui ##llar ##mo ##d , heinrich p ##fan ##nl , victor wes ##sel ##y , and guy knowles via the northeast ridge . [SEP]
[CLS] in the early 1900s , modern transportation did not exist in the region : it took " fourteen days just to reach the foot of the mountain " . [SEP]
[CLS] after five serious and costly attempts , the team reached 65 ##25 m — although considering the difficulty of the challenge , and the lack of modern climbing equipment or weather ##proof fabrics , crowley ' s statement that " neither man nor beast was injured " highlights the pioneering spirit and bravery of the attempt . [SEP]
[CLS] the failures were also attributed to sickness ( crowley was suffering the residual effects of malaria ) , a combination of questionable physical training , personality conflicts , and poor weather conditions — of 68 days spent on k ##2 ( at the time , the record for the longest time spent at such an altitude ) only eight provided clear weather . [SEP]
[CLS] the next attempt on k ##2 was not made until 1938 , when first american kara ##kor ##am expedition led by charles houston made a reconnaissance of the mountain . [SEP]
[CLS] they concluded that the ab ##ru ##zzi spur was the most practical route and reached a height of around 800 ##0 m before turning back due to dim ##ini ##shing supplies and the threat of bad weather . [SEP]
[CLS] the following year , the 1939 american kara ##kor ##am expedition led by fritz wi ##ess ##ner came within 200 m of the summit but ended in disaster when dudley wolfe , pas ##ang ki ##ku ##li , pas ##ang kit ##ar , and pin ##ts ##o disappeared high on the mountain . [SEP]
[CLS] charles houston returned to k ##2 to lead the 1953 american expedition . [SEP]
[CLS] the attempt ended in failure after a storm pinned down the team for 10 days at 780 ##0 m , during which time climb ##er art gil ##key became critically ill . [SEP]
[CLS] a desperate retreat followed , during which pete sc ##hoe ##ning saved almost the entire team during a mass fall ( known simply as the bela ##y ) , and gil ##key was killed , either in an avalanche or in a deliberate attempt to avoid burden ##ing his companions . [SEP]
[CLS] despite the retreat and tragic end , the expedition has been given iconic status in mountain ##eering history . [SEP]
[CLS] the 1954 italian kara ##kor ##am expedition finally succeeded in ascending to the summit of k ##2 via the ab ##ru ##zzi spur on 31 july 1954 . [SEP]
[CLS] the expedition was led by ar ##dit ##o des ##io , and the two climb ##ers who reached the summit were lin ##o laced ##elli and ac ##hill ##e com ##pa ##gnon ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] the team included a pakistani member , colonel muhammad ata - ul ##lah , who had been a part of the 1953 american expedition . [SEP]
[CLS] also on the expedition were walter bon ##att ##i and pakistani hu ##nza porter amir me ##hdi , who both proved vital to the expedition ' s success in that they carried oxygen tanks to 81 ##00 m for laced ##elli and com ##pa ##gnon ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] the ascent is controversial because laced ##elli and com ##pa ##gnon ##i established their camp at a higher elevation than originally agreed with me ##hdi and bon ##att ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] it being too dark to as ##cend or descend , me ##hdi and bon ##att ##i were forced to overnight without shelter above 8 , 000 meters leaving the oxygen tanks behind as requested when they descended . [SEP]
[CLS] bon ##att ##i and me ##hdi survived , but me ##hdi was hospitalized for months and had to have his toes amp ##uta ##ted because of frost ##bit ##e . [SEP]
[CLS] efforts in the 1950s to suppress these facts to protect laced ##elli and com ##pa ##gnon ##i ' s reputation ##s as italian national heroes were later brought to light . [SEP]
[CLS] it was also revealed that the moving of the camp was deliberate , a move apparently made because com ##pa ##gnon ##i feared being outs ##hone by the younger bon ##att ##i . [SEP]
[CLS] bon ##att ##i was given the blame for me ##hdi ' s hospital ##ization . [SEP]
[CLS] on 9 august 1977 , 23 years after the italian expedition , ich ##iro yo ##shi ##zawa led the second successful ascent , with ash ##raf ama ##n as the first native pakistani climb ##er . [SEP]
[CLS] the japanese expedition took the ab ##ru ##zzi spur , and used more than 1 , 500 porter ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the third ascent of k ##2 was in 1978 , via a new route , the long and cornice ##d northeast ridge . [SEP]
[CLS] the top of the route traversed left across the east face to avoid a vertical head ##wall and joined the upper ##most part of the ab ##ru ##zzi route . [SEP]
[CLS] this ascent was made by an american team , led by james w ##hit ##take ##r ; the summit party was louis reich ##ard ##t , jim wi ##ck ##wire , john ro ##ske ##lley , and rick ridge ##way . [SEP]
[CLS] wi ##ck ##wire endured an overnight bi ##vo ##ua ##c about 150 m below the summit , one of the highest bi ##vo ##ua ##cs in history . [SEP]
[CLS] this ascent was emotional for the american team , as they saw themselves as completing a task that had been begun by the 1938 team forty years earlier . [SEP]
[CLS] the first climb ##er to reach the summit of k ##2 twice was czech climb ##er josef ra ##kon ##ca ##j . [SEP]
[CLS] ra ##kon ##ca ##j was a member of the 1983 italian expedition led by francesco santo ##n , which made the second successful ascent of the north ridge ( 31 july 1983 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] three years later , on 5 july 1986 , he reached the summit via the ab ##ru ##zzi spur ( double with broad peak west face solo ) as a member of ago ##sti ##no da pole ##nza ' s international expedition . [SEP]
[CLS] the first woman to summit k ##2 was polish climb ##er wanda ru ##t ##kiewicz on 23 june 1986 . [SEP]
[CLS] lil ##ian ##e and maurice barr ##ard who had summit ##ted later that day , fell during the descent ; lil ##ian ##e barr ##ard ' s body was found on 19 july 1986 at the foot of the south face . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1986 , two polish expeditions summit ##ted via two new routes , the magic line and the polish line ( je ##rzy ku ##ku ##cz ##ka and tad ##eus ##z pi ##ot ##row ##ski ) . [SEP]
[CLS] pi ##ot ##row ##ski fell to his death as the two were descending . [SEP]
[CLS] this latter route has never been repeated . [SEP]
[CLS] thirteen climb ##ers from several expeditions died in the 1986 k ##2 disaster . [SEP]
[CLS] another six mountain ##eers died on 13 august 1995 , while eleven climb ##ers died in the 2008 k ##2 disaster . [SEP]
[CLS] there are a number of routes on k ##2 , of somewhat different character , but they all share some key difficulties , the first being the extremely high altitude and resulting lack of oxygen : there is only one - third as much oxygen available to a climb ##er on the summit of k ##2 as there is at sea level . [SEP]
[CLS] the second is the prop ##ens ##ity of the mountain to experience extreme storms of several days duration , which have resulted in many of the deaths on the peak . [SEP]
[CLS] the third is the steep , exposed , and committing nature of all routes on the mountain , which makes retreat more difficult , especially during a storm . [SEP]
[CLS] despite many attempts there have been no successful winter ascent ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] all major climbing routes lie on the pakistani side , which is also where base camp is located . [SEP]
[CLS] the standard route of ascent , used far more than any other route ( 75 % of all climb ##ers use this route ) is the ab ##ru ##zzi spur , located on the pakistani side , first attempted by prince luigi am ##ede ##o , duke of the ab ##ru ##zzi in 1909 . [SEP]
[CLS] this is the southeast ridge of the peak , rising above the god ##win - austen glacier . [SEP]
[CLS] the spur proper begins at an altitude of 540 ##0 m , where advanced base camp is usually placed . [SEP]
[CLS] the route follows an alternating series of rock ribs , snow / ice fields , and some technical rock climbing on two famous features , " house ' s chimney " and the " black pyramid . " [SEP]
[CLS] above the black pyramid , dangerously exposed and difficult to navigate slopes lead to the easily visible " shoulder " , and thence to the summit . [SEP]
[CLS] the last major obstacle is a narrow co ##ulo ##ir known as the " bottle ##neck " , which places climb ##ers dangerously close to a wall of sera ##cs that form an ice cliff to the east of the summit . [SEP]
[CLS] it was partly due to the collapse of one of these sera ##cs around 2001 that no climb ##ers summit ##ted the peak in 2002 and 2003 . [SEP]
[CLS] on 1 august 2008 , 11 climb ##ers from several expeditions died during a series of accidents , including several ice falls in the bottle ##neck . [SEP]
[CLS] almost opposite from the ab ##ru ##zzi spur is the north ridge , which as ##cend ##s the chinese side of the peak . [SEP]
[CLS] it is rarely climbed , partly due to very difficult access , involving crossing the sha ##ks ##gam river , which is a hazardous undertaking . [SEP]
[CLS] in contrast to the crowds of climb ##ers and trek ##kers at the ab ##ru ##zzi base ##camp , usually at most two teams are en ##camp ##ed below the north ridge . [SEP]
[CLS] this route , more technically difficult than the ab ##ru ##zzi , as ##cend ##s a long , steep , primarily rock ridge to high on the mountain — camp iv , the " eagle ' s nest " at 79 ##00 m — and then crosses a dangerously slide - prone hanging glacier by a left ##ward climbing traverse , to reach a snow co ##ulo ##ir which access ##es the summit . [SEP]
[CLS] besides the original japanese ascent , a notable ascent of the north ridge was the one in 1990 by greg child , greg mortimer , and steve sw ##ens ##on , which was done alpine style above camp 2 , though using some fixed ropes already put in place by a japanese team . [SEP]
[CLS] because 75 % of people who climb k ##2 use the ab ##ru ##zzi spur , these listed routes are rarely climbed . [SEP]
[CLS] no one has climbed the east face of the mountain due to the instability of the snow and ice formations on that side . [SEP]
[CLS] for most of its climbing history , k ##2 was not usually climbed with supplemental oxygen , and small , relatively lightweight teams were the norm . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the 2004 season saw a great increase in the use of oxygen : 28 of 47 summit ##tee ##rs used oxygen in that year . [SEP]
[CLS] acc ##lim ##ati ##sation is essential when climbing without oxygen to avoid some degree of altitude sickness . [SEP]
[CLS] k ##2 ' s summit is well above the altitude at which high altitude pulmonary ed ##ema ( ha ##pe ) , or high altitude cerebral ed ##ema ( ha ##ce ) can occur . [SEP]
[CLS] in mountain ##eering , when ascending above an altitude of 800 ##0 m , the climb ##er enters what is known as the " death zone " . [SEP]
