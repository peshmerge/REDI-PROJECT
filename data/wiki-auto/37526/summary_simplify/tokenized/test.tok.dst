[CLS] er ##os ( ; minor planet designation : 43 ##3 er ##os ) , provisional designation 1898 dq , is a stony and elongated asteroid of the amor group and the first discovered and second - largest near - earth object with a mean - diameter of approximately 16 . 8 kilometers . [SEP]
[CLS] the eccentric asteroid was discovered by german astronomer carl gustav wit ##t at the berlin ur ##ania observatory on 13 august 1898 , and later named after er ##os , a god from greek mythology . [SEP]
[CLS] during the opposition of 1900 – 1901 , a worldwide program was launched to make para ##lla ##x measurements of er ##os to determine the solar para ##lla ##x ( or distance to the sun ) , with the results published in 1910 by arthur hi ##nk ##s of cambridge . [SEP]
[CLS] the value of the astronomical unit ( roughly the earth - sun distance ) obtained by this program was considered definitive until 1968 , when radar and dynamic ##al para ##lla ##x methods started producing more precise measurements . [SEP]
[CLS] er ##os was one of the first asteroids visited by a spacecraft , the first one orbit ##ed , and the first one soft - landed on . [SEP]
[CLS] objects in such an orbit can remain there for only a few hundred million years before the orbit is per ##tur ##bed by gravitational interactions . [SEP]
[CLS] dynamic ##al integration ##s suggest that er ##os may evolve into an earth - cross ##er within as short an interval as two million years , and has a roughly 50 % chance of doing so over a time scale of 10 – 10 years . [SEP]
[CLS] it is a potential earth impact ##or , about five times larger than the impact ##or that created chi ##c ##x ##ulu ##b crater and led to the extinction of the dinosaurs . [SEP]
[CLS] the near shoe ##maker probe visited er ##os twice , first with a 1998 fly ##by , and then by orbiting it in 2000 when it extensively photographed its surface . [SEP]
[CLS] surface gravity depends on the distance from a spot on the surface to the center of a body ' s mass . [SEP]
[CLS] the daytime temperature on er ##os can reach about 100 c at per ##ih ##eli ##on . [SEP]
[CLS] nighttime measurements fall near - 150 c . [SEP]
[CLS] er ##os ' s density is 2 . 67 g / cm , about the same as the density of earth ' s crust . [SEP]
[CLS] near scientists have found that most of the larger rocks strewn across er ##os were ejected from a single crater in an impact approximately 1 billion years ago . [SEP]
[CLS] ( the crater involved was proposed to be named " shoe ##maker " , but is not recognized as such by the international astronomical union ( ia ##u ) , and has been formally designated char ##lo ##is reg ##io . ) [SEP]
[CLS] this event may also be responsible for the 40 percent of the er ##ot ##ian surface that is devoid of craters smaller than 0 . 5 kilometers across . [SEP]
[CLS] an analysis of crater den ##sities over the surface indicates that the areas with lower crater density are within 9 kilometers of the impact point . [SEP]
[CLS] since er ##os is irregular ##ly shaped , parts of the surface anti ##pod ##al to the point of impact can be within 9 kilometres of the impact point ( measured in a straight line through the asteroid ) even though some intervening parts of the surface are more than 9 kilometres away in straight - line distance . [SEP]
[CLS] a suitable analogy would be the distance from the top centre of a bun to the bottom centre as compared to the distance from the top centre to a point on the bun ' s ci ##rc ##um ##ference : top - to - bottom is a longer distance than top - to - periphery when measured along the surface but shorter than it in direct straight - line terms . [SEP]
[CLS] compression from the same impact is believed to have created the thrust fault hi ##nk ##s do ##rs ##um . [SEP]
[CLS] data from the near earth asteroid rendezvous spacecraft collected on er ##os in december 1998 suggests that it could contain 20 , 000 billion kilograms of aluminum and similar amounts of metals that are rare on earth , such as gold and platinum . [SEP]
[CLS] during rare opposition ##s , every 81 years , such as in 1975 and 205 ##6 , er ##os can reach a magnitude of + 7 . 0 , which is brighter than neptune and brighter than any main - belt asteroid except 1 ce ##res , 4 vest ##a and , rarely , 2 pal ##las and 7 iris . [SEP]
