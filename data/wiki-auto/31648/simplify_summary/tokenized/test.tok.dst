[CLS] article three of the united states constitution establishes the judicial branch of the federal government . [SEP]
[CLS] under article three , the judicial branch consists of the supreme court of the united states , as well as lower courts created by congress . [SEP]
[CLS] article three em ##power ##s the courts to handle cases or controversies arising under federal law , as well as other en ##ume ##rated areas . [SEP]
[CLS] article three also defines treason . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 of article three vest ##s the judicial power of the united states in the supreme court , as well as inferior courts established by congress . [SEP]
[CLS] along with the vest ##ing clauses of article one and article two , article three ' s vest ##ing clause establishes the separation of powers between the three branches of government . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 author ##izes the creation of inferior courts , but does not require it ; the first inferior federal courts were established shortly after the ratification of the constitution with the judiciary act of 1789 . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 also establishes that federal judges do not face term limits , and that an individual judge ' s salary may not be decreased . [SEP]
[CLS] article three does not set the size of the supreme court or establish specific positions on the court , but article one establishes the position of chief justice . [SEP]
[CLS] section 2 of article three del ##ine ##ates federal judicial power . [SEP]
[CLS] the case or controversy clause restrict ##s the judiciary ' s power to actual cases and controversies , meaning that federal judicial power does not extend to cases which are hypothetical , or which are pro ##scribe ##d due to standing , mo ##ot ##ness , or ripe ##ness issues . [SEP]
[CLS] section 2 states that federal judiciary ' s power extends to cases arising under the constitution , federal laws , federal treaties , controversies involving multiple states or foreign powers , and other en ##ume ##rated areas . [SEP]
[CLS] section 2 gives the supreme court original jurisdiction when ambassadors , public officials , or the states are a party in the case , leaving the supreme court with appellate jurisdiction in all other areas to which the federal judiciary ' s jurisdiction extends . [SEP]
[CLS] section 2 also gives congress the power to strip the supreme court of appellate jurisdiction , and establishes that all federal crimes must be tried before a jury . [SEP]
[CLS] section 2 does not express ##ly grant the federal judiciary the power of judicial review , but the courts have exercised this power since the 1803 case of " mar ##bury v . madison " . [SEP]
[CLS] section 3 of article three defines treason and em ##power ##s congress to punish treason . [SEP]
[CLS] section 3 requires that at least two witnesses testify to the treason ##ous act , or that the individual accused of treason confesses . [SEP]
[CLS] it also limits the ways in which congress can punish those convicted of treason . [SEP]
[CLS] section 1 is one of the three vest ##ing clauses of the united states constitution , which vest ##s the judicial power of the united states in federal courts , requires a supreme court , allows inferior courts , requires good behavior tenure for judges , and prohibits decreasing the salaries of judges . [SEP]
[CLS] article iii author ##izes one supreme court , but does not set the number of justices that must be appointed to it . [SEP]
[CLS] article i , section 3 , clause 6 refers to a " chief justice " ( who shall pre ##side over the imp ##ea ##chment trial of the president of the united states ) . [SEP]
[CLS] since 1869 the number of justices has been fixed at nine ( by the judiciary act of 1869 ) : one chief justice , and eight associate justices . [SEP]
[CLS] proposals have been made at various times for organizing the supreme court into separate panels ; none garnered wide support , thus the constitutional ##ity of such a division is unknown . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in a 1937 letter ( to senator burton wheeler during the judicial procedures reform bill debate ) , chief justice charles evans hughes wrote , " the constitution does not appear to author ##ize two or more supreme courts functioning in effect as separate courts . " [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court is the only federal court that is explicitly established by the constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] during the constitutional convention , a proposal was made for the supreme court to be the only federal court , having both original jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction . [SEP]
[CLS] this proposal was rejected in favor of the provision that exists today . [SEP]
[CLS] under this provision , the congress may create inferior ( i . e . , lower ) courts under both article iii , section 1 , and article i , section 8 . [SEP]
[CLS] the article iii courts , which are also known as " constitutional courts " , were first created by the judiciary act of 1789 , and are the only courts with judicial power . [SEP]
[CLS] article i courts , which are also known as " legislative courts " , consist of regulatory agencies , such as the united states tax court . [SEP]
[CLS] in certain types of cases , article iii courts may exercise appellate jurisdiction over article i courts . [SEP]
[CLS] in " murray ' s less ##ee v . ho ##bo ##ken land & improvement co . " ( 59 u . s . ( 18 how . ) [SEP]
[CLS] 272 ( 1856 ) ) , the court held that " there are legal matters , involving public rights , which may be presented in such form that the judicial power is capable of acting on them , " and which are susceptible to review by an article iii court . [SEP]
[CLS] later , in " ex part ##e ba ##kel ##ite corp . " ( 279 u . s . 43 ##8 ( 1929 ) ) , the court declared that article i courts " may be created as special tribunal ##s to examine and determine various matters , arising between the government and others , which from their nature do not require judicial determination and yet are susceptible of it . " [SEP]
[CLS] other cases , such as bankruptcy cases , have been held not to involve judicial determination , and may therefore go before article i courts . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , several courts in the district of columbia , which is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the congress , are article i courts rather than article iii courts . [SEP]
[CLS] this article was express ##ly extended to the united states district court for the district of puerto rico by the u . s . congress through federal law 89 - 57 ##1 , 80 stat . [SEP]
[CLS] 76 ##4 , signed by president lyndon b . johnson in 1966 . [SEP]
[CLS] this transformed the article iv united states territorial court in puerto rico , created in 1900 , to an article iii federal judicial district court . [SEP]
[CLS] the judicial procedures reform bill of 1937 , frequently called the court - packing plan , was a legislative initiative to add more justices to the supreme court proposed by president franklin d . roosevelt shortly after his victory in the 1936 presidential election . [SEP]
[CLS] although the bill aimed generally to overhaul and modern ##ize the entire federal court system , its central and most controversial provision would have granted the president power to appoint an additional justice to the supreme court for every incumbent justice over the age of 70 , up to a maximum of six . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution is silent when it comes to judges of courts which have been abolished . [SEP]
[CLS] the judiciary act of 1801 increased the number of courts to permit the federal ##ist president john adams to appoint a number of federal ##ist judges before thomas jefferson took office . [SEP]
[CLS] when jefferson became president , the congress abolished several of these courts and made no provision for the judges of those courts . [SEP]
[CLS] the judicial code of 1911 abolished " circuit riding " and transferred the circuit courts authority and jurisdiction to the district courts . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution provides that judges " shall hold their offices during good behavior . " [SEP]
[CLS] the term " good behavior " is interpreted to mean that judges may serve for the remainder of their lives , although they may resign or retire voluntarily . [SEP]
[CLS] a judge may also be removed by imp ##ea ##chment and conviction by congressional vote ( hence the term good behavior ) ; this has occurred fourteen times . [SEP]
[CLS] three other judges , mark w . del ##aha ##y , george w . english , and samuel b . kent , chose to resign rather than go through the imp ##ea ##chment process . [SEP]
[CLS] the compensation of judges may not be decreased , but may be increased , during their con ##tin ##uance in office . [SEP]
[CLS] section 2 del ##ine ##ates federal judicial power , and brings that power into execution by con ##fer ##ring original jurisdiction and also appellate jurisdiction upon the supreme court . [SEP]
[CLS] additionally , this section requires trial by jury in all criminal cases , except imp ##ea ##chment cases . [SEP]
[CLS] clause 1 of section 2 author ##izes the federal courts to hear actual cases and controversies only . [SEP]
[CLS] their judicial power does not extend to cases which are hypothetical , or which are pro ##scribe ##d due to standing , mo ##ot ##ness , or ripe ##ness issues . [SEP]
[CLS] generally , a case or controversy requires the presence of adverse parties who have a genuine interest at stake in the case . [SEP]
[CLS] in " mu ##sk ##rat v . united states " , 219 u . s . 34 ##6 ( 1911 ) , the supreme court denied jurisdiction to cases brought under a statute permitting certain native americans to bring suit against the united states to determine the constitutional ##ity of a law all ##ocating tribal lands . [SEP]
[CLS] counsel for both sides were to be paid from the federal treasury . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court held that , though the united states was a defendant , the case in question was not an actual controversy ; rather , the statute was merely devised to test the constitutional ##ity of a certain type of legislation . [SEP]
[CLS] thus the court ' s ruling would be nothing more than an advisory opinion ; therefore , the court dismissed the suit for failing to present a " case or controversy . " [SEP]
[CLS] a significant om ##iss ##ion is that although clause 1 provides that federal judicial power shall extend to " the laws of the united states , " it does not also provide that it shall extend to the laws of the " several " or individual states . [SEP]
[CLS] in turn , the judiciary act of 1789 and subsequent acts never granted the u . s . supreme court the power to review decisions of state supreme courts on pure issues of state law . [SEP]
[CLS] it is this silence which ta ##cit ##ly made state supreme courts the final expo ##sitor ##s of the common law in their respective states . [SEP]
[CLS] they were free to diver ##ge from english precedent ##s and from each other on the vast majority of legal issues which had never been made part of federal law by the constitution , and the u . s . supreme court could do nothing , as it would ultimately con ##cede in " erie railroad co . v . tom ##pkins " ( 1938 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] by way of contrast , other english - speaking federation ##s like australia and canada never adopted the " erie " doctrine . [SEP]
[CLS] that is , their highest courts have always possessed pl ##enary power to impose a uniform nationwide common law upon all lower courts and never adopted the strong american distinction between federal and state common law . [SEP]
[CLS] in " chi ##sho ##lm v . georgia " , 2 u . s . 41 ##9 ( 1793 ) , the supreme court ruled that article iii , section 2 ab ##rogated the states ' sovereign immunity and authorized federal courts to hear disputes between private citizens and states . [SEP]
[CLS] this decision was overturned by the eleventh amendment , which was passed by the congress on march 4 , 1794 and ratified by the states on february 7 , 1795 . [SEP]
[CLS] it prohibits the federal courts from hearing " any suit in law or equity , commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state , or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state " . [SEP]
[CLS] clause 2 of section 2 provides that the supreme court has original jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors , ministers and consul ##s , and also in those controversies which are subject to federal judicial power because at least one state is a party ; the court has held that the latter requirement is met if the united states has a controversy with a state . [SEP]
[CLS] in other cases , the supreme court has only appellate jurisdiction , which may be regulated by the congress . [SEP]
[CLS] the congress may not , however , amend the court ' s original jurisdiction , as was found in " mar ##bury v . madison " , 5 u . s . ( cr ##an ##ch 1 ) 137 ( 1803 ) ( the same decision which established the principle of judicial review ) . [SEP]
[CLS] " mar ##bury " held that congress can neither expand nor restrict the original jurisdiction of the supreme court . [SEP]
[CLS] however , the appellate jurisdiction of the court is different . [SEP]
[CLS] the court ' s appellate jurisdiction is given " with such exceptions , and under such regulations as the congress shall make . " [SEP]
[CLS] often a court will assert a modest degree of power over a case for the threshold purpose of determining whether it has jurisdiction , and so the word " power " is not necessarily synonymous with the word " jurisdiction " . [SEP]
[CLS] the power of the federal judiciary to review the constitutional ##ity of a statute or treaty , or to review an administrative regulation for consistency with either a statute , a treaty , or the constitution itself , is an implied power derived in part from clause 2 of section 2 . [SEP]
[CLS] though the constitution does not express ##ly provide that the federal judiciary has the power of judicial review , many of the constitution ' s frame ##rs viewed such a power as an appropriate power for the federal judiciary to possess . [SEP]
[CLS] in " federal ##ist no . 78 " , alexander hamilton wrote , [SEP]
[CLS] others , however , disagreed , claiming that each branch could determine for itself the constitutional ##ity of its actions . [SEP]
[CLS] " mar ##bury v . madison " involved a highly partisan set of circumstances . [SEP]
[CLS] though congressional elections were held in november 1800 , the newly elected officers did not take power until march . [SEP]
[CLS] the federal ##ist party had lost the elections . [SEP]
[CLS] in the words of president thomas jefferson , the federal ##ists " retired into the judiciary as a stronghold " . [SEP]
[CLS] in the four months following the elections , the outgoing congress created several new judges ##hips , which were filled by president john adams . [SEP]
[CLS] in the last - minute rush , however , federal ##ist secretary of state john marshall had neglected to deliver 17 of the commissions to their respective appoint ##ees . [SEP]
[CLS] when james madison took office as secretary of state , several commissions remained und ##eli ##vered . [SEP]
[CLS] bringing their claims under the judiciary act of 1789 , the appoint ##ees , including william mar ##bury , petitioned the supreme court for the issue of a writ of man ##dam ##us , which in english law had been used to force public officials to fulfill their ministerial duties . [SEP]
[CLS] here , madison would be required to deliver the commissions . [SEP]
[CLS] " mar ##bury " posed a difficult problem for the court , which was then led by chief justice john marshall , the same person who had neglected to deliver the commissions when he was the secretary of state . [SEP]
[CLS] if marshall ' s court commanded james madison to deliver the commissions , madison might ignore the order , thereby indicating the weakness of the court . [SEP]
[CLS] similarly , if the court denied william mar ##bury ' s request , the court would be seen as weak . [SEP]
[CLS] marshall held that appoint ##ee mar ##bury was indeed entitled to his commission . [SEP]
[CLS] however , justice marshall contend ##ed that the judiciary act of 1789 was unconstitutional , since it purported to grant original jurisdiction to the supreme court in cases not involving the states or ambassadors . [SEP]
[CLS] the ruling thereby established that the federal courts could exercise judicial review over the actions of congress or the executive branch . [SEP]
[CLS] however , alexander hamilton , in " federal ##ist no . 78 " , expressed the view that the courts hold only the power of words , and not the power of compulsion upon those other two branches of government , upon which the supreme court is itself dependent . [SEP]
[CLS] clause 3 of section 2 provides that federal crimes , except imp ##ea ##chment cases , must be tried before a jury , unless the defendant wai ##ves his right . [SEP]
[CLS] also , the trial must be held in the state where the crime was committed . [SEP]
[CLS] if the crime was not committed in any particular state , then the trial is held in such a place as set forth by the congress . [SEP]
[CLS] the united states senate has the sole power to try imp ##ea ##chment cases . [SEP]
[CLS] two of the constitutional amendments that comprise the bill of rights contain related provisions . [SEP]
[CLS] the sixth amendment en ##ume ##rates the rights of individuals when facing criminal prosecution and the seventh amendment establishes an individual ' s right to a jury trial in certain civil cases . [SEP]
[CLS] it also inhibit ##s courts from over ##turn ##ing a jury ' s findings of fact . [SEP]
[CLS] the supreme court has extended the protections of these amendments to individuals facing trial in state courts through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment . [SEP]
[CLS] section 3 defines treason and its punishment . [SEP]
[CLS] the constitution defines treason as specific acts , namely " levy ##ing war against the united states , or in ad ##hering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort . " [SEP]
[CLS] a contrast is therefore maintained with the english law , whereby crimes including con ##sp ##iring to kill the king or " violating " the queen , were punish ##able as treason . [SEP]
[CLS] in " ex part ##e bo ##ll ##man " , 8 u . s . 75 ( 1807 ) , the supreme court ruled that " there must be an actual ass ##em ##bling of men , for the treason ##able purpose , to constitute a levy ##ing of war . " [SEP]
[CLS] under english law effective during the ratification of the u . s . constitution , there were essentially five species of treason . [SEP]
[CLS] of the five , the constitution adopted only two : levy ##ing war and ad ##hering to enemies . [SEP]
[CLS] omitted were species of treason involving encompassing ( or imagining ) the death of the king , certain types of counter ##feit ##ing , and finally for ##nica ##tion with women in the royal family of the sort which could call into question the parent ##age of royal successors . [SEP]
[CLS] james wilson wrote the original draft of this section , and he was involved as a defense attorney for some accused of treason against the patriot cause . [SEP]
[CLS] the two forms of treason adopted were both derived from the english treason act 135 ##1 . [SEP]
[CLS] based on the above quota ##tion , it was noted by the lawyer william j . olson in an " ami ##cus cu ##ria ##e " in the case " hedges v . obama " that the treason clause was one of the en ##ume ##rated powers of the federal government . [SEP]
[CLS] he also stated that by defining treason in the u . s . constitution and placing it in article iii " the founders intended the power to be checked by the judiciary , ruling out trials by military commissions . [SEP]
[CLS] as james madison noted , the treason clause also was designed to limit the power of the federal government to punish its citizens for ' ad ##hering to the enemies of the united states by , giving them aid and comfort . ' " [SEP]
[CLS] section 3 also requires the testimony of two different witnesses on the same over ##t act , or a confession by the accused in open court , to convict for treason . [SEP]
[CLS] this rule was derived from another english statute , the treason act 1695 . [SEP]
[CLS] in " cramer v . united states " , 325 u . s . 1 ( 1945 ) , the supreme court ruled that " every act , movement , deed , and word of the defendant charged to constitute treason must be supported by the testimony of two witnesses . " [SEP]
[CLS] in " ha ##upt v . united states " , 330 u . s . 63 ##1 ( 1947 ) , however , the supreme court found that two witnesses are not required to prove intent , nor are two witnesses required to prove that an over ##t act is treason ##able . [SEP]
[CLS] the two witnesses , according to the decision , are required to prove only that the over ##t act occurred ( eye ##wi ##tness ##es and federal agents investigating the crime , for example ) . [SEP]
[CLS] punishment for treason may not " work corruption of blood , or for ##feit ##ure except during the life of the person " so convicted . [SEP]
[CLS] the descendants of someone convicted for treason could not , as they were under english law , be considered " tainted " by the treason of their ancestor . [SEP]
[CLS] furthermore , congress may con ##fi ##sca ##te the property of traitor ##s , but that property must be inherit ##able at the death of the person convicted . [SEP]
