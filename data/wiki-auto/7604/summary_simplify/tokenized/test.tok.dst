[CLS] only one provision appears to impose obligations on an official ; this provision establishes that a judge who alter ##s his decision after it is written down is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently . [SEP]
[CLS] this nearly complete example of the code is carved into a basalt ste ##le in the shape of a huge index finger , 2 . 25 m tall . [SEP]
[CLS] it is currently on display in the louvre , with replica ##s in numerous institutions , including the oriental institute at the university of chicago , the northwestern pri ##tz ##ker school of law in chicago , the cl ##end ##ening history of medicine library & museum at the university of kansas medical center , the library of the theological university of the reformed churches in the netherlands , the per ##gam ##on museum of berlin , the arts faculty of the university of le ##uven in belgium , the national museum of iran in tehran , and the department of anthropology , national museum of natural history , smithsonian institution , the university museum at the university of pennsylvania , the push ##kin state museum of fine arts in russia and museum of the bible in washington , dc .

[CLS] in the preface to the law , he states , " an ##u and bel called by name me , ham ##mura ##bi , the ex ##al ##ted prince , who feared god , to bring about the rule of righteous ##ness in the land , to destroy the wicked and the evil - doe ##rs ; so that the strong should not harm the weak ; so that i should rule over the black - headed people like sham ##ash , and en ##light ##en the land , to further the well - being of mankind .

[CLS] it had been taken as pl ##under by the el ##ami ##te king shut ##ru ##k - nah ##hun ##te in the 12th century bc and was taken to su ##sa in el ##am ( located in the present - day k ##hu ##zes ##tan province of iran ) where it was no longer available to the babylonian people . [SEP]
[CLS] however , when cyrus the great brought both babylon and su ##sa under the rule of his persian empire , and placed copies of the document in the library of sip ##par , the text became available for all the peoples of the vast persian empire to view . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1901 , egypt ##ologist gustave je ##qui ##er , a member of an expedition headed by jacques de morgan , found the ste ##le containing the code of ham ##mura ##bi during archaeological excavations at the ancient site of su ##sa in k ##hu ##zes ##tan . [SEP]
[CLS] the code of ham ##mura ##bi is the longest surviving text from the old babylonian period . [SEP]
[CLS] the code is also one of the earliest examples of the idea of pre ##sum ##ption of innocence , and it also suggests that both the accused and accuse ##r have the opportunity to provide evidence . [SEP]
[CLS] the occasional nature of many provisions suggests that the code may be better understood as a cod ##ification of ham ##mura ##bi ' s supplementary judicial decisions , and that , by memorial ##izing his wisdom and justice , its purpose may have been the self - g ##lor ##ification of ham ##mura ##bi rather than a modern legal code or constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] while the code of ham ##mura ##bi was trying to achieve equality , bias ##es still existed against those categorized in the lower end of the social spectrum and some of the punishments and justice could be gr ##ues ##ome . [SEP]
[CLS] the magnitude of criminal penalties often was based on the identity and gender of both the person committing the crime and the victim . [SEP]
[CLS] the code issues justice following the three classes of babylonian society : property owners , freed men , and slaves . [SEP]

[CLS] for example , if a doctor killed a rich patient , he would have his hands cut off , but if he killed a slave , only financial rest ##it ##ution was required . [SEP]
[CLS] women could also receive punishments that their male counterparts would not , as men were permitted to have affairs with their servants and slaves , whereas married women would be harshly punished for committing adultery . [SEP]
[CLS] various copies of portions of the code of ham ##mura ##bi have been found on baked clay tablets , some possibly older than the celebrated basalt ste ##le now in the louvre . [SEP]
[CLS] the prologue of the code of ham ##mura ##bi ( the first 305 inscribed squares on the ste ##le ) is on such a tablet , also at the louvre ( in ##v # ao 102 ##37 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some gaps in the list of benefits bestowed on cities recently annexed by ham ##mura ##bi may imply that it is older than the famous ste ##le ( currently dated to the early 18th century bc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 2010 , archaeologists reported that a fragment ##ary ak ##ka ##dian cu ##ne ##iform tablet was discovered at tel ha ##zo ##r , israel , containing a c . 1700 bc text that was said to be partly parallel to portions of the ham ##mura ##bi code . [SEP]
