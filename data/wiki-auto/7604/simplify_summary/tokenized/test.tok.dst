" [SEP]
[CLS] on the stone slab are 44 columns and 28 paragraph ##s that contained 282 laws . [SEP]
[CLS] some of these laws follow along the rules of " an eye for an eye " . [SEP]
[CLS] it had been taken as pl ##under by the el ##ami ##te king shut ##ru ##k - nah ##hun ##te in the 12th century bc and was taken to su ##sa in el ##am ( located in the present - day k ##hu ##zes ##tan province of iran ) where it was no longer available to the babylonian people . [SEP]
[CLS] however , when cyrus the great brought both babylon and su ##sa under the rule of his persian empire , and placed copies of the document in the library of sip ##par , the text became available for all the peoples of the vast persian empire to view . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1901 , egypt ##ologist gustave je ##qui ##er , a member of an expedition headed by jacques de morgan , found the ste ##le containing the code of ham ##mura ##bi during archaeological excavations at the ancient site of su ##sa in k ##hu ##zes ##tan . [SEP]
[CLS] the code of ham ##mura ##bi was one of the only sets of laws in the ancient near east and also one of the first forms of law . [SEP]
[CLS] the code of laws was arranged in orderly groups , so that all who read the laws would know what was required of them . [SEP]
[CLS] earlier collections of laws include the code of ur - nam ##mu , king of ur ( c . 205 ##0 bc ) , the laws of es ##hn ##un ##na ( c . 1930 bc ) and the codex of lip ##it - is ##hta ##r of is ##in ( c . 1870 bc ) , while later ones include the hit ##tite laws , the assyrian laws , and mosaic law . [SEP]
[CLS] these codes come from similar cultures in a relatively small geographical area , and they have passages which resemble each other . [SEP]
[CLS] the code of ham ##mura ##bi is the longest surviving text from the old babylonian period . [SEP]
[CLS] the code has been seen as an early example of a fundamental law , regulating a government â€“ i . e . , a primitive constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] the code is also one of the earliest examples of the idea of pre ##sum ##ption of innocence , and it also suggests that both the accused and accuse ##r have the opportunity to provide evidence . [SEP]
[CLS] the occasional nature of many provisions suggests that the code may be better understood as a cod ##ification of ham ##mura ##bi ' s supplementary judicial decisions , and that , by memorial ##izing his wisdom and justice , its purpose may have been the self - g ##lor ##ification of ham ##mura ##bi rather than a modern legal code or constitution . [SEP]
[CLS] however , its copying in subsequent generations indicates that it was used as a model of legal and judicial reasoning . [SEP]
[CLS] while the code of ham ##mura ##bi was trying to achieve equality , bias ##es still existed against those categorized in the lower end of the social spectrum and some of the punishments and justice could be gr ##ues ##ome . [SEP]
[CLS] the magnitude of criminal penalties often was based on the identity and gender of both the person committing the crime and the victim . [SEP]
[CLS] the code issues justice following the three classes of babylonian society : property owners , freed men , and slaves . [SEP]
[CLS] punishments for someone assault ##ing someone from a lower class were far lighter than if they had assaulted someone of equal or higher status . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , if a doctor killed a rich patient , he would have his hands cut off , but if he killed a slave , only financial rest ##it ##ution was required . [SEP]
[CLS] women could also receive punishments that their male counterparts would not , as men were permitted to have affairs with their servants and slaves , whereas married women would be harshly punished for committing adultery . [SEP]
[CLS] various copies of portions of the code of ham ##mura ##bi have been found on baked clay tablets , some possibly older than the celebrated basalt ste ##le now in the louvre . [SEP]
[CLS] the prologue of the code of ham ##mura ##bi ( the first 305 inscribed squares on the ste ##le ) is on such a tablet , also at the louvre ( in ##v # ao 102 ##37 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] some gaps in the list of benefits bestowed on cities recently annexed by ham ##mura ##bi may imply that it is older than the famous ste ##le ( currently dated to the early 18th century bc ) . [SEP]
[CLS] likewise , the museum of the ancient orient , part of the istanbul archaeology museums , also has a " code of ham ##mura ##bi " clay tablet , dated to 1790 bc , in ( room 5 , in ##v # ni 235 ##8 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in july 2010 , archaeologists reported that a fragment ##ary ak ##ka ##dian cu ##ne ##iform tablet was discovered at tel ha ##zo ##r , israel , containing a c . 1700 bc text that was said to be partly parallel to portions of the ham ##mura ##bi code . [SEP]
[CLS] the ha ##zo ##r law code fragments are currently being prepared for publication by a team from the hebrew university of jerusalem . [SEP]
[CLS] ham ##mura ##bi had many other punishments , as well . [SEP]
[CLS] if a son strikes his father , his hands shall be he ##wn off . [SEP]
