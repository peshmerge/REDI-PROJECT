[CLS] a tuning fork is an acoustic res ##ona ##tor in the form of a two - pro ##nged fork with the pro ##ng ##s ( tin ##es ) formed from a u - shaped bar of elastic metal ( usually steel ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it res ##onate ##s at a specific constant pitch when set vibrating by striking it against a surface or with an object , and emi ##ts a pure musical tone once the high over ##tones fade out . [SEP]
[CLS] the tuning fork was invented in 1711 by british musician john shore , sergeant trumpeter and lu ##ten ##ist to the court . [SEP]
[CLS] the main reason for using the fork shape is that , unlike many other types of res ##ona ##tors , it produces a very pure tone , with most of the vibration ##al energy at the fundamental frequency . [SEP]
[CLS] by comparison , the first over ##tone of a vibrating string or metal bar is one octave above ( twice ) the fundamental , so when the string is plucked or the bar is struck , its vibrations tend to mix the fundamental and over ##tone frequencies . [SEP]
[CLS] when the tuning fork is struck , little of the energy goes into the over ##tone modes ; they also die out corresponding ##ly faster , leaving a pure sin ##e wave at the fundamental frequency . [SEP]
[CLS] another reason for using the fork shape is that , when it vi ##brates in its principal mode , the handle vi ##brates up and down as the pro ##ng ##s move apart and together . [SEP]
[CLS] the user typically strikes the fork , and then presses the handle against a wooden box res ##ona ##tor , table top , bridge of a musical instrument , or just behind their ear . [SEP]
[CLS] string players sometimes use bone conduct ##ion , holding the stem of the fork in their teeth , so that both hands are free . [SEP]
[CLS] the sound waves from each pro ##ng are 180 ##Â° out of phase with the other , so at a distance from the fork they interfere and largely cancel each other out . [SEP]
[CLS] if a sound - absorbing sheet is slid in between the pro ##ng ##s of a vibrating fork , reducing the waves reaching the ear from one pro ##ng , the volume actually increases , due to a reduction of this cancellation . [SEP]
[CLS] commercial tuning forks are tuned to the correct pitch at the factory , and the pitch and frequency in her ##tz is stamped on them . [SEP]
[CLS] they can be re ##tu ##ned by filing material off the pro ##ng ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] currently , the most common tuning fork sounds the note of a = 440 hz , the standard concert pitch that many orchestras use . [SEP]
[CLS] orchestras between 1750 and 1820 mostly used a = 42 ##3 . 5 hz , though there were many forks and many slightly different pitches . [SEP]
[CLS] standard tuning forks are available that vi ##brate at all the pitches within the central octave of the piano , and also other pitches . [SEP]
[CLS] tuning fork pitch varies slightly with temperature , due mainly to a slight decrease in the mod ##ulus of elastic ##ity of steel with increasing temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] the pitch of other instruments is also subject to variation with temperature change . [SEP]
[CLS] the ratio in the equation above can be re ##written as if the pro ##ng ##s are cylindrical with radius r , and if the pro ##ng ##s have rectangular cross - section of width a along the direction of motion . [SEP]
[CLS] the most popular of these is the rhodes piano , in which hammer ##s hit metal tin ##es that vi ##brate in the magnetic field of a pickup , creating a signal that drives electric amp ##li ##fication . [SEP]
[CLS] the quartz crystal that serves as the time ##keeping element in modern quartz clocks and watches is in the form of a tiny tuning fork . [SEP]
[CLS] it usually vi ##brates at a frequency of 32 , 76 ##8 hz in the ultra ##sonic range ( above the range of human hearing ) . [SEP]
[CLS] quartz is pie ##zo ##ele ##ctric , so the voltage causes the tin ##es to bend rapidly back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] the acc ##ut ##ron , an electro ##me ##chan ##ical watch developed by max het ##zel and manufactured by bu ##lova beginning in 1960 , used a 360 - her ##tz steel tuning fork as its time ##keeper , powered by electro ##ma ##gne ##ts attached to a battery - powered trans ##isto ##r os ##ci ##lla ##tor circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] tuning forks , usually c ##51 ##2 , are used by medical practitioners to assess a patient ' s hearing . [SEP]
[CLS] lower - pitched ones , usually at c1 ##28 , are also used to check vibration sense as part of the examination of the peripheral nervous system . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##th ##oped ##ic surgeons have explored using a tuning fork ( lowest frequency c = 128 ) to assess injuries where bone fracture is suspected . [SEP]
[CLS] they hold the end of the vibrating fork on the skin above the suspected fracture , progressively closer to the suspected fracture . [SEP]
[CLS] if there is a fracture , the per ##ios ##te ##um of the bone vi ##brates , and fire no ##cic ##ept ##ors ( pain receptors ) causing a local sharp pain . [SEP]
[CLS] a systematic review published in 2014 in b ##m ##j open suggests that this technique is not reliable or accurate enough for clinical use . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of the frequency , these forks are labeled with the cal ##ib ##ration speed and radar band ( e . g . , x - band or k - band ) they are cal ##ib ##rated for . [SEP]
[CLS] the tuning fork is kept vibrating at its res ##ona ##nt frequency by a pie ##zo ##ele ##ctric device . [SEP]
[CLS] upon coming in contact with solids , amplitude of os ##ci ##llation goes down , the same is used as a switching parameter for detecting point level for solids . [SEP]
[CLS] for liquids , the res ##ona ##nt frequency of tuning fork changes upon coming in contact with the liquids , change in frequency is used to detect level . [SEP]
