[CLS] a tuning fork is an acoustic res ##ona ##tor in the form of a two - pro ##nged fork with the pro ##ng ##s ( tin ##es ) formed from a u - shaped bar of elastic metal ( usually steel ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it res ##onate ##s at a specific constant pitch when set vibrating by striking it against a surface or with an object , and emi ##ts a pure musical tone once the high over ##tones fade out . [SEP]
[CLS] a tuning fork ' s pitch depends on the length and mass of the two pro ##ng ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] they are traditional sources of standard pitch for tuning musical instruments . [SEP]
[CLS] the tuning fork was invented in 1711 by british musician john shore , sergeant trumpeter and lu ##ten ##ist to the court . [SEP]
[CLS] a tuning fork is a fork - shaped acoustic res ##ona ##tor used in many applications to produce a fixed tone . [SEP]
[CLS] the main reason for using the fork shape is that , unlike many other types of res ##ona ##tors , it produces a very pure tone , with most of the vibration ##al energy at the fundamental frequency . [SEP]
[CLS] the reason for this is that the frequency of the first over ##tone is about = = 6 ⁄ times the fundamental ( about 2 ⁄ octave ##s above it ) . [SEP]
[CLS] by comparison , the first over ##tone of a vibrating string or metal bar is one octave above ( twice ) the fundamental , so when the string is plucked or the bar is struck , its vibrations tend to mix the fundamental and over ##tone frequencies . [SEP]
[CLS] when the tuning fork is struck , little of the energy goes into the over ##tone modes ; they also die out corresponding ##ly faster , leaving a pure sin ##e wave at the fundamental frequency . [SEP]
[CLS] it is easier to tune other instruments with this pure tone . [SEP]
[CLS] another reason for using the fork shape is that , when it vi ##brates in its principal mode , the handle vi ##brates up and down as the pro ##ng ##s move apart and together . [SEP]
[CLS] there is a node ( point of no vibration ) at the base of each pro ##ng . [SEP]
[CLS] the handle motion is small , so the user can hold the fork by the handle without damp ##ing the vibration , but the handle can still transmit the vibration to a res ##ona ##tor , which amp ##li ##fies the sound of the fork . [SEP]
[CLS] the user typically strikes the fork , and then presses the handle against a wooden box res ##ona ##tor , table top , bridge of a musical instrument , or just behind their ear . [SEP]
[CLS] string players sometimes use bone conduct ##ion , holding the stem of the fork in their teeth , so that both hands are free . [SEP]
[CLS] if just held in open air , the sound of a tuning fork is very faint . [SEP]
[CLS] the sound waves from each pro ##ng are 180 ##° out of phase with the other , so at a distance from the fork they interfere and largely cancel each other out . [SEP]
[CLS] if a sound - absorbing sheet is slid in between the pro ##ng ##s of a vibrating fork , reducing the waves reaching the ear from one pro ##ng , the volume actually increases , due to a reduction of this cancellation . [SEP]
[CLS] commercial tuning forks are tuned to the correct pitch at the factory , and the pitch and frequency in her ##tz is stamped on them . [SEP]
[CLS] they can be re ##tu ##ned by filing material off the pro ##ng ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] filing the ends of the pro ##ng ##s raises the pitch , while filing the inside of the base of the pro ##ng ##s lowers it . [SEP]
[CLS] currently , the most common tuning fork sounds the note of a = 440 hz , the standard concert pitch that many orchestras use . [SEP]
[CLS] that a is the pitch of the violin ' s second string , the first string of the viola , and an octave above the first string of the cello . [SEP]
[CLS] orchestras between 1750 and 1820 mostly used a = 42 ##3 . 5 hz , though there were many forks and many slightly different pitches . [SEP]
[CLS] standard tuning forks are available that vi ##brate at all the pitches within the central octave of the piano , and also other pitches . [SEP]
[CLS] well - known tuning fork manufacturers include rag ##g and john walker , both of sheffield , england . [SEP]
[CLS] tuning fork pitch varies slightly with temperature , due mainly to a slight decrease in the mod ##ulus of elastic ##ity of steel with increasing temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] a change in frequency of 48 parts per million per °f ( 86 pp ##m per °c ) is typical for a steel tuning fork . [SEP]
[CLS] the frequency decreases ( becomes flat ) with increasing temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] tuning forks are manufactured to have their correct pitch at a standard temperature . [SEP]
[CLS] the standard temperature is now 20 °c , but 15 °c is an older standard . [SEP]
[CLS] the pitch of other instruments is also subject to variation with temperature change . [SEP]
[CLS] the ratio in the equation above can be re ##written as if the pro ##ng ##s are cylindrical with radius r , and if the pro ##ng ##s have rectangular cross - section of width a along the direction of motion . [SEP]
[CLS] tuning forks have traditionally been used to tune musical instruments , though electronic tune ##rs have largely replaced them . [SEP]
[CLS] forks can be driven electrically by placing electronic os ##ci ##lla ##tor - driven electro ##ma ##gne ##ts close to the pro ##ng ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] a number of keyboard musical instruments use principles similar to tuning forks . [SEP]
[CLS] the most popular of these is the rhodes piano , in which hammer ##s hit metal tin ##es that vi ##brate in the magnetic field of a pickup , creating a signal that drives electric amp ##li ##fication . [SEP]
[CLS] the earlier , un - amplified du ##lc ##ito ##ne , which used tuning forks directly , suffered from low volume . [SEP]
[CLS] the quartz crystal that serves as the time ##keeping element in modern quartz clocks and watches is in the form of a tiny tuning fork . [SEP]
[CLS] it usually vi ##brates at a frequency of 32 , 76 ##8 hz in the ultra ##sonic range ( above the range of human hearing ) . [SEP]
[CLS] it is made to vi ##brate by small os ##ci ##lla ##ting voltage ##s applied to metal electrode ##s plate ##d on the surface of the crystal by an electronic os ##ci ##lla ##tor circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] quartz is pie ##zo ##ele ##ctric , so the voltage causes the tin ##es to bend rapidly back and forth . [SEP]
[CLS] the acc ##ut ##ron , an electro ##me ##chan ##ical watch developed by max het ##zel and manufactured by bu ##lova beginning in 1960 , used a 360 - her ##tz steel tuning fork as its time ##keeper , powered by electro ##ma ##gne ##ts attached to a battery - powered trans ##isto ##r os ##ci ##lla ##tor circuit . [SEP]
[CLS] the fork provided greater accuracy than conventional balance wheel watches . [SEP]
[CLS] the humming sound of the tuning fork was audible when the watch was held to the ear . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatives to the common a = 440 standard include philosophical or scientific pitch with standard pitch of c = 512 . [SEP]
[CLS] according to ray ##leigh , physicist ##s and acoustic instrument makers used this pitch . [SEP]
[CLS] the tuning fork john shore gave to george fr ##ider ##ic handel produces c = 512 . [SEP]
[CLS] tuning forks , usually c ##51 ##2 , are used by medical practitioners to assess a patient ' s hearing . [SEP]
[CLS] this is most commonly done with two exams called the weber test and ri ##nne test , respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] lower - pitched ones , usually at c1 ##28 , are also used to check vibration sense as part of the examination of the peripheral nervous system . [SEP]
[CLS] or ##th ##oped ##ic surgeons have explored using a tuning fork ( lowest frequency c = 128 ) to assess injuries where bone fracture is suspected . [SEP]
[CLS] they hold the end of the vibrating fork on the skin above the suspected fracture , progressively closer to the suspected fracture . [SEP]
[CLS] if there is a fracture , the per ##ios ##te ##um of the bone vi ##brates , and fire no ##cic ##ept ##ors ( pain receptors ) causing a local sharp pain . [SEP]
[CLS] this can indicate a fracture , which the practitioner refers for medical x - ray . [SEP]
[CLS] the sharp pain of a local sp ##rain can give a false positive . [SEP]
[CLS] established practice , however , requires an x - ray regardless , because it ' s better than missing a real fracture while wondering if a response means a sp ##rain . [SEP]
[CLS] a systematic review published in 2014 in b ##m ##j open suggests that this technique is not reliable or accurate enough for clinical use . [SEP]
[CLS] tuning forks also play a role in several alternative therapy practices , such as son ##op ##un ##cture and polar ##ity therapy . [SEP]
[CLS] a radar gun that measures the speed of cars or a ball in sports is usually cal ##ib ##rated with a tuning fork . [SEP]
[CLS] instead of the frequency , these forks are labeled with the cal ##ib ##ration speed and radar band ( e . g . , x - band or k - band ) they are cal ##ib ##rated for . [SEP]
[CLS] doubled and h - type tuning forks are used for tactical - grade vibrating structure g ##yr ##os ##cope ##s and various types of micro ##ele ##ct ##rom ##ech ##ani ##cal systems . [SEP]
[CLS] tuning fork forms the sensing part of vibrating point level sensors point level sensors . [SEP]
[CLS] the tuning fork is kept vibrating at its res ##ona ##nt frequency by a pie ##zo ##ele ##ctric device . [SEP]
[CLS] upon coming in contact with solids , amplitude of os ##ci ##llation goes down , the same is used as a switching parameter for detecting point level for solids . [SEP]
[CLS] for liquids , the res ##ona ##nt frequency of tuning fork changes upon coming in contact with the liquids , change in frequency is used to detect level . [SEP]
