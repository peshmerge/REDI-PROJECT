[CLS] in mathematics , a bi ##ject ##ion , bi ##ject ##ive function , or one - to - one correspondence is a function between the elements of two sets , where each element of one set is paired with exactly one element of the other set , and each element of the other set is paired with exactly one element of the first set . [SEP]
[CLS] if " x " and " y " are finite sets , then the existence of a bi ##ject ##ion means they have the same number of elements . [SEP]
[CLS] for infinite sets the picture is more complicated , leading to the concept of cardinal number , a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets . [SEP]
[CLS] bi ##ject ##ive functions are essential to many areas of mathematics including the definitions of iso ##morphism , home ##omo ##rp ##hism , di ##ffe ##omo ##rp ##hism , per ##mut ##ation group , and projective map . [SEP]
[CLS] it is more common to see properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) written as a single statement : every element of " x " is paired with exactly one element of " y " . [SEP]
[CLS] functions which satisfy property ( 3 ) are said to be " onto " y " " and are called sur ##ject ##ions ( or sur ##ject ##ive functions ) . [SEP]
[CLS] functions which satisfy property ( 4 ) are said to be " one - to - one functions " and are called injection ##s ( or in ##ject ##ive functions ) . [SEP]
[CLS] this symbol is a combination of the two - headed right ##ward ##s arrow sometimes used to denote sur ##ject ##ions and the right ##ward ##s arrow with a barbed tail sometimes used to denote injection ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] consider the batting line - up of a baseball or cricket team ( or any list of all the players of any sports team where every player holds a specific spot in a line - up ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the set " x " will be the players on the team ( of size nine in the case of baseball ) and the set " y " will be the positions in the batting order ( 1st , 2nd , 3rd , etc . ) [SEP]
[CLS] property ( 3 ) says that for each position in the order , there is some player batting in that position and property ( 4 ) states that two or more players are never batting in the same position in the list . [SEP]
[CLS] in a classroom there are a certain number of seats . [SEP]
[CLS] a bunch of students enter the room and the instructor asks them all to be seated . [SEP]
[CLS] after a quick look around the room , the instructor declares that there is a bi ##ject ##ion between the set of students and the set of seats , where each student is paired with the seat they are sitting in . [SEP]
[CLS] what the instructor observed in order to reach this conclusion was that : the instructor was able to conclude that there were just as many seats as there were students , without having to count either set . [SEP]
[CLS] the process of " turning the arrows around " for an arbitrary function does not , " in general " , yield a function , but properties ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of a bi ##ject ##ion say that this inverse relation is a function with domain " y " . [SEP]
[CLS] moreover , properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) then say that this inverse " function " is a sur ##ject ##ion and an injection , that is , the inverse function exists and is also a bi ##ject ##ion . [SEP]
[CLS] stated in con ##cise mathematical notation , a function " f " : " x â†’ y " is bi ##ject ##ive if and only if it sat ##is ##fies the condition [SEP]
[CLS] continuing with the baseball batting line - up example , the function that is being defined takes as input the name of one of the players and outputs the position of that player in the batting order . [SEP]
[CLS] since this function is a bi ##ject ##ion , it has an inverse function which takes as input a position in the batting order and outputs the player who will be batting in that position . [SEP]
[CLS] indeed , in ax ##iom ##atic set theory , this is taken as the definition of " same number of elements " ( e ##quin ##ume ##ros ##ity ) , and general ##ising this definition to infinite sets leads to the concept of cardinal number , a way to distinguish the various sizes of infinite sets . [SEP]
[CLS] bi ##ject ##ions are precisely the iso ##morphism ##s in the category set of sets and set functions . [SEP]
[CLS] the notion of one - to - one correspondence general ##izes to partial functions , where they are called partial bi ##ject ##ions , although partial bi ##ject ##ions are only required to be in ##ject ##ive . [SEP]
[CLS] the reason for this relaxation is that a ( proper ) partial function is already und ##efined for a portion of its domain ; thus there is no compelling reason to con ##stra ##in its inverse to be a total function , i . e . [SEP]
[CLS] the set of all partial bi ##ject ##ions on a given base set is called the symmetric inverse semi ##group . [SEP]
[CLS] when the partial bi ##ject ##ion is on the same set , it is sometimes called a one - to - one partial transformation . [SEP]
