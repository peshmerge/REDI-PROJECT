[CLS] the two books of kings , originally a single book , are the eleventh and twelfth books of the hebrew bible or old testament . [SEP]
[CLS] they conclude the de ##uter ##ono ##mist ##ic history , a history of israel also comprising the books of joshua and judges and the two books of samuel , which biblical commentators believe was written to provide a theological explanation for the destruction of the kingdom of judah by babylon in c . 58 ##6 bce and a foundation for a return from exile . [SEP]
[CLS] the two books of kings present a history of ancient israel and judah from the death of king david to the release of je ##ho ##iac ##hin from imprisonment in babylon , a period of some 400 years ( 960 – c . 560 bce ) . [SEP]
[CLS] scholars tend to treat the books as made up of a first edition from the late 7th century bce and a second and final edition from the mid 6th century bce . [SEP]
[CLS] in david ' s old age , ad ##oni ##jah pro ##claim ##s himself his successor but solomon ' s supporters arrange for david to pro ##claim solomon as his successor , and so he comes to the throne after david ' s death . [SEP]
[CLS] at the beginning of his reign he assumes god ' s promises to david and brings sp ##len ##dou ##r to israel and peace and prosperity to his people . [SEP]
[CLS] the centre ##piece of solomon ' s reign is the building of the first temple : the claim that this took place 480 years after the exodus from egypt marks it as a key event in israel ' s history . [SEP]
[CLS] at the end , however , he follows other gods and op ##press ##es israel . [SEP]
[CLS] as a consequence of solomon ' s failure to stamp out the worship of gods other than ya ##h ##we ##h , the kingdom of david is split in two in the reign of his own son re ##ho ##bo ##am , who becomes the first to reign over the kingdom of judah . [SEP]
[CLS] the kings who follow re ##ho ##bo ##am in jerusalem continue the royal line of david ( i . e . , they inherit the promise to david ) ; in the north , however , dynasties follow each other in rapid succession , and the kings are uniformly bad ( meaning that they fail to follow ya ##h ##we ##h alone ) . [SEP]
[CLS] at length god brings the assyrian ##s to destroy the northern kingdom , leaving judah as the sole cu ##sto ##dian of the promise . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##zek ##iah , the 14th king of judah , does " what is right in the lord ’ s sight just as his ancestor david had done " and institutes a far reaching religious reform , central ##ising sacrifice at the temple at jerusalem and destroying the images of other gods . [SEP]
[CLS] ya ##h ##we ##h saves jerusalem and the kingdom from an invasion by ass ##yria . [SEP]
[CLS] but mana ##sse ##h , the next king , reverse ##s the reforms , and god announces that he will destroy jerusalem because of this ap ##osta ##sy by the king . [SEP]
[CLS] mana ##sse ##h ' s righteous grandson josiah reins ##ti ##tute ##s the reforms of he ##zek ##iah , but it is too late : god , speaking through the prophet ##ess hu ##lda ##h , af ##firm ##s that jerusalem is to be destroyed after the death of josiah . [SEP]
[CLS] in the final chapters , god brings the neo - babylonian empire of king ne ##buch ##ad ##ne ##zza ##r against jerusalem ; ya ##h ##we ##h with ##hold ##s aid from his people , jerusalem is ra ##zed and the temple destroyed , and the priests , prophets and royal court are led into captivity . [SEP]
[CLS] the final verses record how je ##ho ##iac ##hin , the last king , is set free and given honour by the king of babylon . [SEP]
[CLS] in the hebrew bible ( the bible used by jews ) , first and second kings are a single book , as are the first and second books of samuel . [SEP]
[CLS] when this was translated into greek in the last few centuries bce , kings was joined with samuel in a four - part work called the book of kingdoms . [SEP]
[CLS] orthodox christians continue to use the greek translation ( the sept ##ua ##gin ##t ) , but when a latin translation ( called the vu ##lga ##te ) was made for the western church , kingdoms was first re ##titled the book of kings , parts one to four , and eventually both kings and samuel were separated into two books each . [SEP]
[CLS] then , what it is now commonly known as 1 samuel and 2 samuel are called by the vu ##lga ##te , in imitation of the sept ##ua ##gin ##t , 1 kings and 2 kings respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] what it is now commonly known as 1 kings and 2 kings would be 3 kings and 4 kings in old bible ##s before the year 151 ##6 such as the vu ##lga ##te and the sept ##ua ##gin ##t respectively . [SEP]
[CLS] the division we know today , used by protestant bible ##s and adopted by catholics , came into use in 151 ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] some bible ##s still preserve the old denomination , for example , the do ##ua ##y r ##heim ##s bible . [SEP]
[CLS] according to jewish tradition the author of kings was jeremiah , who would have been alive during the fall of jerusalem in 58 ##6 bce . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common view today accepts martin not ##h ' s thesis that kings concludes a unified series of books which reflect the language and theology of the book of de ##uter ##ono ##my , and which biblical scholars therefore call the de ##uter ##ono ##mist ##ic history . [SEP]
[CLS] not ##h argued that the history was the work of a single individual living in the 6th century bce , but scholars today tend to treat it as made up of at least two layers , a first edition from the time of josiah ( late 7th century bce ) , promoting josiah ' s religious reforms and the need for rep ##ent ##ance , and ( 2 ) a second and final edition from the mid 6th century bce . [SEP]
[CLS] further levels of editing have also been proposed , including : a late 8th century bce edition pointing to he ##zek ##iah of judah as the model for kings ##hip ; an earlier 8th century bce version with a similar message but identifying je ##hu of israel as the ideal king ; and an even earlier version promoting the house of david as the key to national well - being . [SEP]
[CLS] the editors / authors of the de ##uter ##ono ##mist ##ic history cite a number of sources , including ( for example ) a " book of the acts of solomon " and , frequently , the " annals of the kings of judah " and a separate book , " chronicles of the kings of israel " . [SEP]
[CLS] the " de ##uter ##ono ##mic " perspective ( that of the book of de ##uter ##ono ##my ) is particularly evident in prayers and speeches spoken by key figures at major transition points : solomon ' s speech at the dedication of the temple is a key example . [SEP]
[CLS] kings is " history - like " rather than history in the modern sense , mixing legends , folk ##tale ##s , miracle stories and " fictional constructions " in with the annals , and its primary explanation for all that happens is god ' s offended sense of what is right ; it is therefore more fruit ##ful to read it as theological literature in the form of history . [SEP]
[CLS] the theological bias is seen in the way it judges each king of israel on the basis of whether he recognise ##s the authority of the temple in jerusalem ( none do , and therefore all are " evil " ) , and each king of judah on the basis of whether he destroys the " high places " ( rivals to the temple in jerusalem ) ; it gives only passing mention to important and successful kings like om ##ri and je ##ro ##bo ##am ii and totally ignores one of the most significant events in ancient israel ' s history , the battle of q ##ar ##qa ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] another and related theme is that of prophecy . [SEP]
[CLS] the main point of the prophet ##ic stories is that god ' s prop ##he ##cies are always fulfilled , so that any not yet fulfilled will be so in the future . [SEP]
[CLS] the implication , the release of je ##ho ##iac ##hin and his restoration to a place of honour in babylon in the closing scenes of the book , is that the promise of an eternal david ##ic dynasty is still in effect , and that the david ##ic line will be restored . [SEP]
[CLS] the standard hebrew text of kings presents an impossible chronology . [SEP]
[CLS] to take just a single example , om ##ri ' s accession to the throne of israel in the 31st year of asa of judah ( 1 kings 16 : 23 ) cannot follow the death of his predecessor z ##im ##ri in the 27th year of asa ( 1 kings 16 : 15 ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the greek text correct ##s the imp ##oss ##ib ##ili ##ties but does not seem to represent an earlier version . [SEP]
[CLS] a large number of scholars have claimed to solve the difficulties , but the results differ , sometimes widely , and none has achieved consensus status . [SEP]
[CLS] the book 2 chronicles covers much the same time - period as the books of kings , but it ignores the northern kingdom of israel almost completely , david is given a major role in planning the temple , he ##zek ##iah is given a much more far - reaching program of reform , and mana ##sse ##h of judah is given an opportunity to rep ##ent of his sins , apparently to account for his long reign . [SEP]
[CLS] it is usually assumed that the author of chronicles used kings as a source and emphasis ##ed different areas as he would have liked it to have been interpreted . [SEP]
