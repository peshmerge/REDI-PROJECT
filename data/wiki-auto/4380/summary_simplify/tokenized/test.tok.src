[CLS] they conclude the de ##uter ##ono ##mist ##ic history , a history of israel also comprising the books of joshua and judges and the two books of samuel , which biblical commentators believe was written to provide a theological explanation for the destruction of the kingdom of judah by babylon in c . 58 ##6 bce and a foundation for a return from exile . [SEP]
[CLS] scholars tend to treat the books as made up of a first edition from the late 7th century bce and a second and final edition from the mid 6th century bce . [SEP]
[CLS] the centre ##piece of solomon ' s reign is the building of the first temple : the claim that this took place 480 years after the exodus from egypt marks it as a key event in israel ' s history . [SEP]
[CLS] as a consequence of solomon ' s failure to stamp out the worship of gods other than ya ##h ##we ##h , the kingdom of david is split in two in the reign of his own son re ##ho ##bo ##am , who becomes the first to reign over the kingdom of judah . [SEP]
[CLS] the kings who follow re ##ho ##bo ##am in jerusalem continue the royal line of david ( i . e . , they inherit the promise to david ) ; in the north , however , dynasties follow each other in rapid succession , and the kings are uniformly bad ( meaning that they fail to follow ya ##h ##we ##h alone ) . [SEP]
[CLS] at length god brings the assyrian ##s to destroy the northern kingdom , leaving judah as the sole cu ##sto ##dian of the promise . [SEP]
[CLS] he ##zek ##iah , the 14th king of judah , does " what is right in the lord â€™ s sight just as his ancestor david had done " and institutes a far reaching religious reform , central ##ising sacrifice at the temple at jerusalem and destroying the images of other gods . [SEP]
[CLS] but mana ##sse ##h , the next king , reverse ##s the reforms , and god announces that he will destroy jerusalem because of this ap ##osta ##sy by the king . [SEP]
[CLS] in the final chapters , god brings the neo - babylonian empire of king ne ##buch ##ad ##ne ##zza ##r against jerusalem ; ya ##h ##we ##h with ##hold ##s aid from his people , jerusalem is ra ##zed and the temple destroyed , and the priests , prophets and royal court are led into captivity . [SEP]
[CLS] the final verses record how je ##ho ##iac ##hin , the last king , is set free and given honour by the king of babylon . [SEP]
[CLS] orthodox christians continue to use the greek translation ( the sept ##ua ##gin ##t ) , but when a latin translation ( called the vu ##lga ##te ) was made for the western church , kingdoms was first re ##titled the book of kings , parts one to four , and eventually both kings and samuel were separated into two books each . [SEP]
[CLS] according to jewish tradition the author of kings was jeremiah , who would have been alive during the fall of jerusalem in 58 ##6 bce . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common view today accepts martin not ##h ' s thesis that kings concludes a unified series of books which reflect the language and theology of the book of de ##uter ##ono ##my , and which biblical scholars therefore call the de ##uter ##ono ##mist ##ic history . [SEP]
[CLS] not ##h argued that the history was the work of a single individual living in the 6th century bce , but scholars today tend to treat it as made up of at least two layers , a first edition from the time of josiah ( late 7th century bce ) , promoting josiah ' s religious reforms and the need for rep ##ent ##ance , and ( 2 ) a second and final edition from the mid 6th century bce . [SEP]
[CLS] further levels of editing have also been proposed , including : a late 8th century bce edition pointing to he ##zek ##iah of judah as the model for kings ##hip ; an earlier 8th century bce version with a similar message but identifying je ##hu of israel as the ideal king ; and an even earlier version promoting the house of david as the key to national well - being . [SEP]
[CLS] the editors / authors of the de ##uter ##ono ##mist ##ic history cite a number of sources , including ( for example ) a " book of the acts of solomon " and , frequently , the " annals of the kings of judah " and a separate book , " chronicles of the kings of israel " . [SEP]
[CLS] kings is " history - like " rather than history in the modern sense , mixing legends , folk ##tale ##s , miracle stories and " fictional constructions " in with the annals , and its primary explanation for all that happens is god ' s offended sense of what is right ; it is therefore more fruit ##ful to read it as theological literature in the form of history . [SEP]
[CLS] the theological bias is seen in the way it judges each king of israel on the basis of whether he recognise ##s the authority of the temple in jerusalem ( none do , and therefore all are " evil " ) , and each king of judah on the basis of whether he destroys the " high places " ( rivals to the temple in jerusalem ) ; it gives only passing mention to important and successful kings like om ##ri and je ##ro ##bo ##am ii and totally ignores one of the most significant events in ancient israel ' s history , the battle of q ##ar ##qa ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] the implication , the release of je ##ho ##iac ##hin and his restoration to a place of honour in babylon in the closing scenes of the book , is that the promise of an eternal david ##ic dynasty is still in effect , and that the david ##ic line will be restored . [SEP]
[CLS] the book 2 chronicles covers much the same time - period as the books of kings , but it ignores the northern kingdom of israel almost completely , david is given a major role in planning the temple , he ##zek ##iah is given a much more far - reaching program of reform , and mana ##sse ##h of judah is given an opportunity to rep ##ent of his sins , apparently to account for his long reign . [SEP]
[CLS] it is usually assumed that the author of chronicles used kings as a source and emphasis ##ed different areas as he would have liked it to have been interpreted . [SEP]
