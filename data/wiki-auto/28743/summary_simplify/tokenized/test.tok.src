[CLS] as graphical analog cal ##cula ##tors , slide rules are closely related to no ##mo ##gram ##s , but the former are used for general calculations , whereas the latter are used for application - specific computation ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] though similar in name and appearance to a standard ruler , the slide rule is not meant to be used for measuring length or drawing straight lines . [SEP]
[CLS] slide rules exist in a diverse range of styles and generally appear in a linear or circular form with a standardized set of markings ( scales ) essential to performing mathematical computation ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] at its simplest , each number to be multiplied is represented by a length on a sliding ruler . [SEP]
[CLS] as the rulers each have a log ##ari ##th ##mic scale , it is possible to align them to read the sum of the log ##ari ##th ##ms , and hence calculate the product of the two numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] the reverend william ought ##red and others developed the slide rule in the 17th century based on the emerging work on log ##ari ##th ##ms by john napier . [SEP]
[CLS] before the advent of the electronic cal ##cula ##tor , it was the most commonly used calculation tool in science and engineering . [SEP]
[CLS] the use of slide rules continued to grow through the 1950s and 1960s even as computers were being gradually introduced ; but around 1974 the handheld electronic scientific cal ##cula ##tor made them largely obsolete and most suppliers left the business . [SEP]
[CLS] in its most basic form , the slide rule uses two log ##ari ##th ##mic scales to allow rapid multiplication and division of numbers . [SEP]
[CLS] scales may be grouped in decades , which are numbers ranging from 1 to 10 ( i . e . [SEP]
[CLS] thus single decade scales c and d range from 1 to 10 across the entire width of the slide rule while double decade scales a and b range from 1 to 100 over the width of the slide rule . [SEP]
[CLS] in general , mathematical calculations are performed by align ##ing a mark on the sliding central strip with a mark on one of the fixed strips , and then observing the relative positions of other marks on the strips . [SEP]
[CLS] numbers aligned with the marks give the approximate value of the product , quo ##tie ##nt , or other calculated result . [SEP]
[CLS] the user determines the location of the decimal point in the result , based on mental estimation . [SEP]
[CLS] addition and sub ##tra ##ction steps in a calculation are generally done mentally or on paper , not on the slide rule . [SEP]
[CLS] most slide rules consist of three linear strips of the same length , aligned in parallel and inter ##lock ##ed so that the central strip can be moved length ##wise relative to the other two . [SEP]
[CLS] some slide rules ( " du ##plex " models ) have scales on both sides of the rule and slide strip , others on one side of the outer strips and both sides of the slide strip ( which can usually be pulled out , flipped over and reins ##erted for convenience ) , still others on one side only ( " simple ##x " rules ) . [SEP]
[CLS] a sliding with a vertical alignment line is used to find corresponding points on scales that are not adjacent to each other or , in du ##plex models , are on the other side of the rule . [SEP]
[CLS] the cu ##rso ##r can also record an intermediate result on any of the scales . [SEP]
[CLS] moving the top scale to the right by a distance of formula _ 3 , by matching the beginning of the top scale with the label formula _ 4 on the bottom , align ##s each number formula _ 5 , at position formula _ 6 on the top scale , with the number at position formula _ 7 on the bottom scale . [SEP]
[CLS] this works because the distances from the " 1 " are proportional to the log ##ari ##th ##ms of the marked values : operations may go " off the scale ; " for example , the diagram above shows that the slide rule has not positioned the 7 on the upper scale above any number on the lower scale , so it does not give any answer for 2 ##× ##7 . [SEP]
[CLS] in such cases , the user may slide the upper scale to the left until its right index align ##s with the 2 , effectively dividing by 10 ( by sub ##tra ##cting the full length of the c - scale ) and then multi ##ply ##ing by 7 , as in the illustration below : here the user of the slide rule must remember to adjust the decimal point appropriately to correct the final answer . [SEP]
[CLS] method 1 is easy to understand , but en ##tails a loss of precision . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to the log ##ari ##th ##mic scales , some slide rules have other mathematical functions encoded on other auxiliary scales . [SEP]
[CLS] some rules include a p ##yt ##ha ##gor ##ean scale , to figure sides of triangles , and a scale to figure circles . [SEP]
[CLS] to compute formula _ 12 , for example , locate x on the d scale and read its square on the a scale . [SEP]
[CLS] care must be taken when the base , x , is found in more than one place on its scale . [SEP]
[CLS] when several ll scales are present , use the one with " x " on it . [SEP]
[CLS] alternatively , use the right ##most 1 on the c scale , and read the answer off the next higher ll scale . [SEP]
[CLS] to extract a cube root using a slide rule with only c / d and a / b scales , align 1 on the b cu ##rso ##r with the base number on the a scale ( taking care as always to distinguish between the lower and upper halves of the a scale ) . [SEP]
[CLS] for angles from around 5 . 7 up to 90 degrees , sin ##es are found by comparing the s scale with c ( or d ) scale ; though on many closed - body rules the s scale relates to the a scale instead , and what follows must be adjusted appropriately . [SEP]
[CLS] the s scale has a second set of angles ( sometimes in a different color ) , which run in the opposite direction , and are used for co ##sin ##es . [SEP]
[CLS] tangent ##s are found by comparing the t scale with the c ( or d ) scale for angles less than 45 degrees . [SEP]
[CLS] common forms such as formula _ 15 can be read directly from " x " on the s scale to the result on the d scale , when the c - scale index is set at " k " . [SEP]
[CLS] many slide rules have s , t , and st scales marked with degrees and minutes ( e . g . [SEP]
[CLS] base - 10 log ##ari ##th ##ms and exponential ##s are found using the l scale , which is linear . [SEP]
[CLS] some slide rules have a l ##n scale , which is for base e . log ##ari ##th ##ms to any other base can be calculated by rev ##ers ##ing the procedure for calculating powers of a number . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , log ##2 values can be determined by lining up either left ##most or right ##most 1 on the c scale with 2 on the ll ##2 scale , finding the number whose log ##ari ##th ##m is to be calculated on the corresponding ll scale , and reading the log ##2 value on the c scale . [SEP]
[CLS] slide rules are not typically used for addition and sub ##tra ##ction , but it is nevertheless possible to do so using two different techniques . [SEP]
[CLS] the first method to perform addition and sub ##tra ##ction on the c and d ( or any comparable scales ) requires converting the problem into one of division . [SEP]
[CLS] this method is similar to the addition / sub ##tra ##ction technique used for high - speed electronic circuits with the log ##ari ##th ##mic number system in specialized computer applications like the gravity pipe ( grape ) super ##com ##put ##er and hidden marko ##v models . [SEP]
[CLS] scales on the most common " 10 - inch " models are actually 25 cm , as they were made to metric standards , though some rules offer slightly extended scales to sim ##plify manipulation when a result over ##flow ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] models a couple of metres wide were made to be hung in classrooms for teaching purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] typically the divisions mark a scale to a precision of two significant figures , and the user estimates the third figure . [SEP]
[CLS] such cu ##rso ##rs can effectively double the accuracy of readings , permitting a 10 - inch slide rule to serve as well as a 20 - inch model . [SEP]
[CLS] circular slide rules come in two basic types , one with two cu ##rso ##rs , and another with a free dish and one cu ##rso ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] the dual cu ##rso ##r versions perform multiplication and division by holding a fast angle between the cu ##rso ##rs as they are rotated around the dial . [SEP]
[CLS] the one ##fold cu ##rso ##r version operates more like the standard slide rule through the appropriate alignment of the scales . [SEP]
[CLS] circular slide rules also eliminate " off - scale " calculations , because the scales were designed to " wrap around " ; they never have to be re ##ori ##ented when results are near 1 . 0 — the rule is always on scale . [SEP]
[CLS] circular slide rules are mechanically more rugged and smooth ##er - moving , but their scale alignment precision is sensitive to the center ##ing of a central pi ##vot ; a minute 0 . 1 mm off - centre of the pi ##vot can result in a 0 . 2 mm worst case alignment error . [SEP]
[CLS] the main disadvantage ##s of circular slide rules are the difficulty in locating figures along a dish , and limited number of scales . [SEP]
[CLS] another draw ##back of circular slide rules is that less - important scales are closer to the center , and have lower precision ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] most students learned slide rule use on the linear slide rules , and did not find reason to switch . [SEP]
[CLS] one slide rule remaining in daily use around the world is the e ##6 ##b . [SEP]
[CLS] this is a circular slide rule first created in the 1930s for aircraft pilots to help with dead reckon ##ing . [SEP]
[CLS] with the aid of scales printed on the frame it also helps with such miscellaneous tasks as converting time , distance , speed , and temperature values , compass errors , and calculating fuel use . [SEP]
[CLS] while gps has reduced the use of dead reckon ##ing for aerial navigation , and handheld cal ##cula ##tors have taken over many of its functions , the e ##6 ##b remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of proficiency in its use . [SEP]
[CLS] lining up the original and desired size values on the inner and outer wheels will display their ratio as a percentage in a small window . [SEP]
[CLS] they are not as common since the advent of computer ##ized layout , but [SEP]
[CLS] in 1952 , swiss watch company br ##eit ##ling introduced a pilot ' s wrist ##watch with an integrated circular slide rule specialized for flight calculations : the br ##eit ##ling na ##vi ##time ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] the na ##vi ##time ##r circular rule , referred to by br ##eit ##ling as a " navigation computer " , featured airs ##peed , rate / time of climb / descent , flight time , distance , and fuel consumption functions , as well as kilometer — nautical mile and gallon — liter fuel amount conversion functions . [SEP]
[CLS] there are two main types of cylindrical slide rules : those with he ##lica ##l scales such as the fuller , the otis king and the by ##grave slide rule , and those with bars , such as the tha ##cher and some log ##a models . [SEP]
[CLS] in either case , the advantage is a much longer scale , and hence potentially greater precision , than afforded by a straight or circular rule . [SEP]
[CLS] at least one high precision instrument was made of steel . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1895 , a japanese firm , hem ##mi , started to make slide rules from bamboo , which had the advantages of being dimensional ##ly stable , strong , and naturally self - lu ##bri ##cating . [SEP]
[CLS] all premium slide rules had numbers and scales engraved , and then filled with paint or other resin . [SEP]
[CLS] premium slide rules included clever catches so the rule would not fall apart by accident , and bumper ##s to protect the scales and cu ##rso ##r from rubbing on tablet ##ops . [SEP]
[CLS] the recommended cleaning method for engraved markings is to scrub lightly with steel - wool . [SEP]
[CLS] the slide rule was invented around 1620 – 1630 , shortly after john napier ' s publication of the concept of the log ##ari ##th ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1620 edmund gunter of oxford developed a calculating device with a single log ##ari ##th ##mic scale ; with additional measuring tools it could be used to multi ##ply and divide . [SEP]
[CLS] in c . 1622 , william ought ##red of cambridge combined two handheld gunter rules to make a device that is rec ##og ##ni ##za ##bly the modern slide rule . [SEP]
[CLS] like his contemporary at cambridge , isaac newton , ought ##red taught his ideas privately to his students . [SEP]
[CLS] also like newton , he became involved in a vi ##tri ##olic controversy over priority , with his one - time student richard del ##ama ##in and the prior claims of wing ##ate . [SEP]
[CLS] ought ##red ' s ideas were only made public in publications of his student william forster in 1632 and 1653 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 167 ##7 , henry co ##gg ##esh ##all created a two - foot folding rule for timber measure , called the co ##gg ##esh ##all slide rule , expanding the slide rule ' s use beyond mathematical inquiry . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1722 , warner introduced the two - and three - decade scales , and in 1755 ever ##ard included an inverted scale ; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a " poly ##pha ##se " rule . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1815 , peter mark ro ##get invented the log log slide rule , which included a scale displaying the log ##ari ##th ##m of the log ##ari ##th ##m . [SEP]
[CLS] this allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and expo ##nent ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1821 , nathaniel bow ##dit ##ch , described in the " american practical navigator " a " sliding rule " that contained scales tri ##gon ##ometric functions on the fixed part and a line of log - sin ##es and log - tan ##s on the slide ##r used to solve navigation problems . [SEP]
[CLS] a more modern form of slide rule was created in 1859 by french artillery lieutenant am ##ede ##e mannheim , " who was fortunate in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation and in having it adopted by the french artillery . " [SEP]
[CLS] the du ##plex rule was invented by william cox in 1891 , and was produced by ke ##uf ##fe ##l and es ##ser co . of new york . [SEP]
[CLS] astronomical work also required precise computation ##s , and , in 19th - century germany , a steel slide rule about two meters long was used at one observatory . [SEP]
[CLS] until the advent of the pocket digital cal ##cula ##tor , students also might keep a ten - or twenty - inch rule for precision work at home or the office while carrying a five - inch pocket slide rule around with them . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2004 , education researchers david b . she ##r and dean c . nat ##aro conceived a new type of slide rule based on " pro ##st ##ha ##pha ##eres ##is " , an algorithm for rapidly computing products that pre ##dates log ##ari ##th ##ms . [SEP]
[CLS] slide rules have often been specialized to varying degrees for their field of use , such as ex ##cise , proof calculation , engineering , navigation , etc . , but some slide rules are extremely specialized for very narrow applications . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the john ra ##bone & sons 1892 catalog lists a " measuring tape and cattle gauge " , a device to estimate the weight of a cow from its measurements . [SEP]
[CLS] there were many specialized slide rules for photographic applications ; for example , the act ##ino ##graph of hurt ##er and dr ##iff ##ield was a two - slide box ##wood , brass , and cardboard device for est ##imating exposure from time of day , time of year , and latitude . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the fisher controls company distributed a customized slide rule adapted to solving the equations used for selecting the proper size of industrial flow control valves . [SEP]
[CLS] pilot balloon slide rules were used by meteor ##ologists in weather services to determine the upper wind ve ##lo ##cit ##ies from an ascending hydrogen or helium filled pilot balloon . [SEP]
[CLS] in world war ii , bombardier ##s and navigator ##s who required quick calculations often used specialized slide rules . [SEP]
[CLS] one office of the u . s . navy actually designed a generic slide rule " chassis " with an aluminium body and plastic cu ##rso ##r into which cell ##ulo ##id cards ( printed on both sides ) could be placed for special calculations . [SEP]
[CLS] the process was invented to calculate range , fuel use and altitude for aircraft , and then adapted to many other purposes . [SEP]
[CLS] the e ##6 - b is a circular slide rule used by pilots and navigator ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the importance of the slide rule began to dim ##ini ##sh as electronic computers , a new but rare resource in the 1950s , became more widely available to technical workers during the 1960s . [SEP]
[CLS] another step away from slide rules was the introduction of relatively inexpensive electronic desktop scientific cal ##cula ##tors . [SEP]
[CLS] the first included the wang laboratories lo ##ci - 2 , introduced in 1965 , which used log ##ari ##th ##ms for multiplication and division ; and the he ##wl ##ett - packard hp 910 ##0 ##a , introduced in 1968 . [SEP]
[CLS] as with main ##frame computing , the availability of these machines did not significantly affect the ubiquitous use of the slide rule until cheap hand held scientific electronic cal ##cula ##tors became available in the mid - 1970s , at which point , it rapidly declined . [SEP]
[CLS] this led engineers to use mathematical equations that favored operations that were easy on a slide rule over more accurate but complex functions ; these approximation ##s could lead to ina ##cc ##ura ##cies and mistakes . [SEP]
[CLS] on the other hand , the spatial , manual operation of slide rules cult ##ivate ##s in the user an intuition for numerical relationships and scale that people who have used only digital cal ##cula ##tors often lack . [SEP]
[CLS] a slide rule requires the user to separately compute the order of magnitude of the answer in order to position the decimal point in the results . [SEP]
[CLS] this separate calculation is less likely to lead to extreme calculation errors , but forces the user to keep track of magnitude in short - term memory ( which is error - prone ) , keep notes ( which is cum ##bers ##ome ) or reason about it in every step ( which distract ##s from the other calculation requirements ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the typical arithmetic precision of a slide rule is about three significant digits , compared to many digits on digital cal ##cula ##tors . [SEP]
[CLS] as order of magnitude gets the greatest prominence when using a slide rule , users are less likely to make errors of false precision . [SEP]
[CLS] when performing a sequence of multiplication ##s or divisions by the same number , the answer can often be determined by merely glancing at the slide rule without any manipulation . [SEP]
[CLS] other useful linear conversions such as pounds to kilograms can be easily marked on the rule and used directly in calculations . [SEP]
[CLS] being entirely mechanical , a slide rule does not depend on grid electricity or batteries . [SEP]
[CLS] however , mechanical imp ##re ##cision in slide rules that were poorly constructed or warped by heat or use will lead to errors . [SEP]
[CLS] many sailors keep slide rules as backup ##s for navigation in case of electric failure or battery de ##ple ##tion on long route segments . [SEP]
[CLS] the e ##6 ##b circular slide rule used by pilots has been in continuous production and remains available in a variety of models . [SEP]
[CLS] some wrist watches designed for aviation use still feature slide rule scales to permit quick calculations . [SEP]
[CLS] others keep their old slide rules out of a sense of nostalgia , or collect them as a hobby . [SEP]
[CLS] although a great many slide rules are circulating on the market , specimens in good condition tend to be expensive . [SEP]
[CLS] many rules found for sale on are damaged or have missing parts , and the seller may not know enough to supply the relevant information . [SEP]
[CLS] the ke ##uf ##fe ##l and es ##ser rules from the period up to about 1950 are particularly problematic , because the end - pieces on the cu ##rso ##rs , made of cell ##ulo ##id , tend to chemical ##ly break down over time . [SEP]
[CLS] there are still a handful of sources for brand new slide rules . [SEP]
[CLS] the con ##cise company of tokyo , which began as a manufacturer of circular slide rules in july 1954 , continues to make and sell them today . [SEP]
[CLS] in september 2009 , on - line retailer think ##gee ##k introduced its own brand of straight slide rules , described as " faithful replica ##s " that are " individually hand tool ##ed " . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , faber - caste ##ll has a number of slide rules still in inventory , available for international purchase through their web store . [SEP]
[CLS] specialized slide rules such as the e ##6 ##b used in aviation , and gunnery slide rules used in laying artillery are still used though no longer on a routine basis . [SEP]
[CLS] these rules are used as part of the teaching and instruction process as in learning to use them the student also learns about the principles behind the calculations , it also allows the student to be able to use these instruments as a back up in the event that the modern electronics in general use fail . [SEP]
[CLS] the ke ##uf ##fe ##l and es ##ser company slide rule collection , from the slide rule manufacturer formerly located in brooklyn , new york , was donated to mit around 2005 . [SEP]
