[CLS] sir andrew john wil ##es ( born 11 april 1953 ) is an english mathematician and a royal society research professor at the university of oxford , specialising in number theory . [SEP]
[CLS] he is best known for proving fe ##rma ##t ' s last theorem , for which he was awarded the 2016 abel prize and the 2017 cop ##ley medal by the royal society . [SEP]
[CLS] he was appointed knight commander of the order of the british empire in 2000 , and in 2018 was appointed as the first reg ##ius professor of mathematics at oxford . [SEP]
[CLS] wil ##es was born on 11 april 1953 in cambridge , england , the son of maurice frank wil ##es ( 1923 – 2005 ) , later the reg ##ius professor of divinity at the university of oxford , and patricia wil ##es ( nee mo ##wl ##l ) . [SEP]
[CLS] his father worked as the chaplain at ridley hall , cambridge , for the years 1952 – 55 . [SEP]
[CLS] wil ##es attended king ' s college school , cambridge , and the ley ##s school , cambridge . [SEP]
[CLS] wil ##es states that he came across fe ##rma ##t ' s last theorem on his way home from school when he was 10 years old . [SEP]
[CLS] he stopped at his local library where he found a book about the theorem . [SEP]
[CLS] fascinated by the existence of a theorem that was so easy to state that he , a ten year old , could understand it , but that no one had proven , he decided to be the first person to prove it . [SEP]
[CLS] however , he soon realised that his knowledge was too limited , so he abandoned his childhood dream , until it was brought back to his attention at the age of 33 by ken rib ##et ' s 1986 proof of the epsilon conjecture , which gerhard frey had previously linked to fe ##rma ##t ' s famous equation . [SEP]
[CLS] wil ##es earned his bachelor ' s degree in mathematics in 1974 at merton college , oxford , and a phd in 1980 as a graduate student of clare college , cambridge . [SEP]
[CLS] after a stay at the institute for advanced study in princeton , new jersey , in 1981 , wil ##es became a professor of mathematics at princeton university . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1985 – 86 , wil ##es was a guggenheim fellow at the institut des haute ##s etudes sci ##ent ##if ##iques near paris and at the ecole normal ##e super ##ieu ##re . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1988 to 1990 , wil ##es was a royal society research professor at the university of oxford , and then he returned to princeton . [SEP]
[CLS] from 1994 to 2009 , wil ##es was a eugene higgins professor at princeton . [SEP]
[CLS] he rejoined oxford in 2011 as royal society research professor . [SEP]
[CLS] in may 2018 he was appointed reg ##ius professor of mathematics at oxford , the first in the university ' s history . [SEP]
[CLS] wil ##es ' s graduate research was guided by john coat ##es beginning in the summer of 1975 . [SEP]
[CLS] together these colleagues worked on the arithmetic of elliptic curves with complex multiplication by the methods of i ##was ##awa theory . [SEP]
[CLS] he further worked with barry ma ##zu ##r on the main conjecture of i ##was ##awa theory over the rational numbers , and soon afterward , he general ##ised this result to totally real fields . [SEP]
[CLS] his biographical page at princeton university ' s website states that " andrew has few equals in terms of his impact on modern number theory . [SEP]
[CLS] many of the world ’ s very best young number theorists received their phd ##s under andrew . . . and many of these are today leaders and professors at top institutions around the world " . [SEP]
[CLS] starting in mid - 1986 , based on successive progress of the previous few years of gerhard frey , jean - pierre ser ##re and ken rib ##et , it became clear that fe ##rma ##t ' s last theorem could be proven as a co ##roll ##ary of a limited form of the modular ##ity theorem ( un ##pro ##ven at the time and then known as the " tan ##iya ##ma – shi ##mura – wei ##l conjecture " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the modular ##ity theorem involved elliptic curves , which was also wil ##es ' s own specialist area . [SEP]
[CLS] the conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as important , but extra ##ord ##ina ##rily difficult or perhaps impossible to prove . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , wil ##es ' s ex - supervisor john coat ##es states that it seemed " impossible to actually prove " , and ken rib ##et considered himself " one of the vast majority of people who believed it was completely inaccessible " , adding that " andrew wil ##es was probably one of the few people on earth who had the au ##da ##city to dream that you can actually go and prove it . " [SEP]
[CLS] despite this , wil ##es , with his from - childhood fascination with fe ##rma ##t ' s last theorem , decided to undertake the challenge of proving the conjecture , at least to the extent needed for frey ' s curve . [SEP]
[CLS] he dedicated all of his research time to this problem for over six years in near - total secrecy , covering up his efforts by releasing prior work in small segments as separate papers and con ##fi ##ding only in his wife . [SEP]
[CLS] in june 1993 , he presented his proof to the public for the first time at a conference in cambridge . [SEP]
[CLS] in august 1993 , it was discovered that the proof contained a flaw in one area . [SEP]
[CLS] wil ##es tried and failed for over a year to repair his proof . [SEP]
[CLS] according to wil ##es , the crucial idea for ci ##rc ##um ##venting , rather than closing , this area came to him on 19 september 1994 , when he was on the verge of giving up . [SEP]
[CLS] together with his former student richard taylor , he published a second paper which ci ##rc ##um ##vent ##ed the problem and thus completed the proof . [SEP]
[CLS] both papers were published in may 1995 in a dedicated issue of the " annals of mathematics . " [SEP]
[CLS] wil ##es ' s proof of fe ##rma ##t ' s last theorem has stood up to the scrutiny of the world ' s other mathematical experts . [SEP]
[CLS] wil ##es was interviewed for an episode of the bbc documentary series " horizon " that focused on fe ##rma ##t ' s last theorem . [SEP]
[CLS] this was renamed " the proof " , and it was made an episode of the us public broadcasting service ' s science television series " nova " . [SEP]
[CLS] his work and life are also described in great detail in simon singh ' s popular book " fe ##rma ##t ' s last theorem " . [SEP]
