[CLS] bra ##ille ( ; ] ) is a ta ##ct ##ile writing system used by people who are visually impaired . [SEP]
[CLS] it is traditionally written with em ##bos ##sed paper . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille users can read computer screens and other electronic supports using ref ##resh ##able bra ##ille displays . [SEP]
[CLS] they can write bra ##ille with the original slate and st ##ylus or type it on a bra ##ille writer , such as a portable bra ##ille note ##take ##r or computer that prints with a bra ##ille em ##bos ##ser . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille literacy is a social - justice issue . [SEP]
[CLS] early bra ##ille education is crucial to literacy , education and employment among the blind . [SEP]
[CLS] however , in the face of changes in education policy and screen reader software , bra ##ille usage has declined in recent decades , despite the fact that technologies such as bra ##ille displays have also made bra ##ille more accessible and practical . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille is named after its creator , louis bra ##ille , a frenchman who lost his sight as a result of a childhood accident . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1824 , at the age of fifteen , he developed a code for the french alphabet as an improvement on night writing . [SEP]
[CLS] he published his system , which subsequently included musical notation , in 1829 . [SEP]
[CLS] the second revision , published in 1837 , was the first small binary form of writing developed in the modern era . [SEP]
[CLS] these characters have rectangular blocks called " cells " that have tiny bumps called " raised dots " . [SEP]
[CLS] the number and arrangement of these dots distinguish one character from another . [SEP]
[CLS] since the various bra ##ille alphabet ##s originated as transcription codes for printed writing , the mapping ##s ( sets of character designations ) vary from language to language , and even within one ; in english bra ##ille there are three levels of encoding : grade 1 – a letter - by - letter transcription used for basic literacy ; grade 2 – an addition of abbreviation ##s and contraction ##s ; and grade 3 – various non - standardized personal ste ##no ##graphy . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille cells are not the only thing to appear in bra ##ille text . [SEP]
[CLS] there may be em ##bos ##sed illustrations and graphs , with the lines either solid or made of series of dots , arrows , bullets that are larger than bra ##ille dots , etc . [SEP]
[CLS] a full bra ##ille cell includes six raised dots arranged in two columns , each column having three dots . [SEP]
[CLS] the dot positions are identified by numbers from one to six . [SEP]
[CLS] there are 64 possible combinations , including no dots at all for a word space . [SEP]
[CLS] a cell can be used to represent a letter , digit , pun ##ct ##uation mark , or even a word . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille was based on a ta ##ct ##ile military code called night writing , developed by charles barbie ##r in response to napoleon ' s demand for a means for soldiers to communicate silently at night and without a light source . [SEP]
[CLS] in barbie ##r ' s system , sets of 12 em ##bos ##sed dots encoded 36 different sounds . [SEP]
[CLS] it proved to be too difficult for soldiers to recognize by touch and was rejected by the military . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1821 barbie ##r visited the royal institute for the blind in paris , where he met louis bra ##ille . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille identified two major defects of the code : first , by representing only sounds , the code was unable to render the or ##th ##ography of the words ; second , the human finger could not encompass the whole 12 - dot symbol without moving , and so could not move rapidly from one symbol to another . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille ' s solution was to use 6 - dot cells and to assign a specific pattern to each letter of the alphabet . [SEP]
[CLS] at first , bra ##ille was a one - to - one translit ##eration of french or ##th ##ography , but soon various abbreviation ##s , contraction ##s , and even logo ##gram ##s were developed , creating a system much more like short ##hand . [SEP]
[CLS] the expanded english system , called grade - 2 bra ##ille , was completed by 1905 . [SEP]
[CLS] for blind readers , bra ##ille is an independent writing system , rather than a code of printed or ##th ##ography . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille is derived from the latin alphabet , albeit indirectly . [SEP]
[CLS] in bra ##ille ' s original system , the dot patterns were assigned to letters according to their position within the alphabet ##ic order of the french alphabet , with accent ##ed letters and " w " sorted at the end . [SEP]
[CLS] the first ten letters of the alphabet , " a – j , " use the upper four dot positions : ( black dots in the table below ) . [SEP]
[CLS] these stand for the ten digits " 1 – 9 " and " 0 " in a system parallel to hebrew gem ##at ##ria and greek iso ##pse ##phy . [SEP]
[CLS] ( though the dots are assigned in no obvious order , the cells with the few ##est dots are assigned to the first three letters ( and lowest digits ) , " abc = 123 " , and to the three vowels in this part of the alphabet , " ae ##i " , whereas the even digits , " 4 , 6 , 8 , 0 " , are corners / right angles . ) [SEP]
[CLS] the next ten letters ( the next " decade " ) are the same again , but with dots also at both position 3 and position 6 ( green dots in the table above ) . [SEP]
[CLS] here " w " was left out as not being a part of the official french alphabet at the time of bra ##ille ' s life ; the french bra ##ille order is " u v x y z c e a e u " . [SEP]
[CLS] the next ten letters , ending in " w " , are the same again , except that for this series position 6 ( purple dot in the table above ) is used without a dot at position 3 . [SEP]
[CLS] in french bra ##ille these are the letters " a e i o u e i u o w " . [SEP]
[CLS] " w " had been tack ##ed onto the end of 39 letters of the french alphabet to accommodate english . [SEP]
[CLS] the " a – j " series shifted down by one dot space is used for pun ##ct ##uation . [SEP]
[CLS] letters " a " and " c " , which only use dots in the top row , were shifted two places for the ap ##ost ##rop ##he and h ##yp ##hen : . [SEP]
[CLS] ( these are also the decade dia ##cr ##itic ##s , at left in the table below , of the second and third decade . ) [SEP]
[CLS] in addition , there are ten patterns that are based on the first two letters with their dots shifted to the right ; these were assigned to non - french letters ( " i a o " ) , or serve non - letter functions : ( super ##script ; in english the accent mark ) , ( currency prefix ) , ( capital , in english the decimal point ) , ( number sign ) , ( emphasis mark ) , ( symbol prefix ) . [SEP]
[CLS] originally there had been nine decades . [SEP]
[CLS] the fifth through ninth used dash ##es as well as dots , but proved to be imp ##rac ##tical and were soon abandoned . [SEP]
[CLS] these could be replaced with what we now know as the number sign , though that only caught on for the digits ( old 5th decade → modern 1st decade ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the dash occupying the top row of the original sixth decade was simply dropped , producing the modern fifth decade . [SEP]
[CLS] historically , there have been three principles in assign ##ing the values of a linear script ( print ) to bra ##ille : using louis bra ##ille ' s original french letter values ; re ##ass ##ign ##ing the bra ##ille letters according to the sort order of the print alphabet being transcribed ; and re ##ass ##ign ##ing the letters to improve the efficiency of writing in bra ##ille . [SEP]
[CLS] under international consensus , most bra ##ille alphabet ##s follow the french sorting order for the 26 letters of the basic latin alphabet , and there have been attempts at un ##ifying the letters beyond these 26 ( see international bra ##ille ) , though differences remain , for example in german bra ##ille and the contraction ##s of english bra ##ille . [SEP]
[CLS] this unification avoids the chaos of each nation re ##ord ##ering the bra ##ille code to match the sorting order of its print alphabet , as happened in algerian bra ##ille , where bra ##ille codes were numerical ##ly reassigned to match the order of the arabic alphabet and bear little relation to the values used in other countries ( compare modern arabic bra ##ille , which uses the french sorting order ) , and as happened in an early american version of english bra ##ille , where the letters " w , x , y , z " were reassigned to match english alphabet ##ical order . [SEP]
[CLS] a convention sometimes seen for letters beyond the basic 26 is to exploit the physical symmetry of bra ##ille patterns iconic ##ally , for example , by assign ##ing a reversed " n " to " n " or an inverted " s " to " sh " . [SEP]
[CLS] ( see hungarian bra ##ille and b ##harat ##i bra ##ille , which do this to some extent . ) [SEP]
[CLS] a third principle was to assign bra ##ille codes according to frequency , with the simplest patterns ( quick ##est ones to write with a st ##ylus ) assigned to the most frequent letters of the alphabet . [SEP]
[CLS] such frequency - based alphabet ##s were used in germany and the united states in the 19th century ( see american bra ##ille ) , but with the invention of the bra ##ille type ##writer their advantage disappeared , and none are attested in modern use – they had the disadvantage that the resulting small number of dots in a text interfered with following the alignment of the letters , and consequently made texts more difficult to read than bra ##ille ' s more arbitrary letter - assignment . [SEP]
[CLS] finally , there are bra ##ille scripts which don ' t order the codes numerical ##ly at all , such as japanese bra ##ille and korean bra ##ille , which are based on more abstract principles of syllable composition . [SEP]
[CLS] academic texts are sometimes written in a script of eight dots per cell rather than six , enabling them to en ##code a greater number of symbols . [SEP]
[CLS] ( see gardner – sal ##inas bra ##ille codes . ) [SEP]
[CLS] luxembourg ##ish bra ##ille has adopted eight - dot cells for general use ; for example , it adds a dot below each letter to derive its capital variant . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille was the first writing system with binary encoding . [SEP]
[CLS] within an individual cell , the dot positions are arranged in two columns of three positions . [SEP]
[CLS] a raised dot can appear in any of the six positions , producing sixty - four ( 2 ) possible patterns , including one in which there are no raised dots . [SEP]
[CLS] for reference purposes , a pattern is commonly described by listing the positions where dots are raised , the positions being universally numbered , from top to bottom , as 1 to 3 on the left and 4 to 6 on the right . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , dot pattern 1 - 3 - 4 describes a cell with three dots raised , at the top and bottom in the left column and at the top of the right column : that is , the letter " m " . [SEP]
[CLS] the lines of horizontal bra ##ille text are separated by a space , much like visible printed text , so that the dots of one line can be differentiated from the bra ##ille text above and below . [SEP]
[CLS] different assignments of bra ##ille codes ( or code pages ) are used to map the character sets of different printed scripts to the six - bit cells . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille assignments have also been created for mathematical and musical notation . [SEP]
[CLS] however , because the six - dot bra ##ille cell allows only 64 ( 2 ) patterns , including space , the characters of a bra ##ille script commonly have multiple values , depending on their context . [SEP]
[CLS] that is , character mapping between print and bra ##ille is not one - to - one . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the character corresponds in print to both the letter " d " and the digit " 4 " . [SEP]
[CLS] in addition to simple encoding , many bra ##ille alphabet ##s use contraction ##s to reduce the size of bra ##ille texts and to increase reading speed . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille may be produced by hand using a slate and st ##ylus in which each dot is created from the back of the page , writing in mirror image , or it may be produced on a bra ##ille type ##writer or perkins bra ##ille ##r , or an electronic bra ##ille ##r or e ##bra ##ille ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] because bra ##ille letters cannot be effectively erased and written over if an error is made , an error is over ##written with all six dots . [SEP]
[CLS] " inter ##point " refers to bra ##ille printing that is offset , so that the paper can be em ##bos ##sed on both sides , with the dots on one side appearing between the di ##vot ##s that form the dots on the other ( see the photo in the box at the top of this article for an example ) . [SEP]
[CLS] using a computer or other electronic device , bra ##ille may be produced with a bra ##ille em ##bos ##ser ( printer ) or a ref ##resh ##able bra ##ille display ( screen ) . [SEP]
[CLS] the first 25 bra ##ille letters , up through the first half of the 3rd decade , trans ##cr ##ibe " a – z " ( skipping " w " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] in english bra ##ille , the rest of that decade is rounded out with the liga ##tures " and , for , of , the , " and " with " . [SEP]
[CLS] om ##itt ##ing dot 3 from these forms the 4th decade , the liga ##tures " ch , g ##h , sh , th , w ##h , ed , er , ou , ow " and the letter " w " . [SEP]
[CLS] various format ##ting marks affect the values of the letters that follow them . [SEP]
[CLS] they have no direct equivalent in print . [SEP]
[CLS] the most important in english bra ##ille are : that is , is read as capital ' a ' , and as the digit ' 1 ' . [SEP]
[CLS] pun ##ct ##uation varies from language to language . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , french bra ##ille uses for its question mark and swap ##s the quota ##tion marks and parentheses ( to and ) ; it uses the period for the decimal point , as in print , and the decimal point to mark capital ##ization . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille contraction ##s are words and af ##fi ##xes that are shortened so that they take up fewer cells . [SEP]
[CLS] in english bra ##ille , for example , the word " afternoon " is written with just three letters , ⟨ af ##n ⟩ , much like ste ##nos ##cript . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also several abbreviation marks that create what are effectively logo ##gram ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] the most common of these is dot 5 , which combines with the first letter of words . [SEP]
[CLS] with the letter " m " , the resulting word is " mother " . [SEP]
[CLS] there are also liga ##tures ( " contracted " letters ) , which are single letters in bra ##ille but correspond to more than one letter in print . [SEP]
[CLS] the letter " and " , for example , is used to write words with the sequence " a - n - d " in them , such as " hand " . [SEP]
[CLS] most bra ##ille em ##bos ##ser ##s support between 34 and 40 cells per line , and 25 lines per page . [SEP]
[CLS] a manually operated perkins bra ##ille type ##writer supports a maximum of 42 cells per line ( its margins are adjustable ) , and typical paper allows 25 lines per page . [SEP]
[CLS] a large inter ##lining stains ##by has 36 cells per line and 18 lines per page . [SEP]
[CLS] an a ##4 - sized mar ##burg bra ##ille frame , which allows inter ##point bra ##ille ( dots on both sides of the page , offset so they do not interfere with each other ) has 30 cells per line and 27 lines per page . [SEP]
[CLS] a bra ##ille writing machine is a type ##writer with six keys that allow to write in bra ##ille alphabet on a regular white page . [SEP]
[CLS] the first bra ##ille type ##writer to gain general acceptance was invented by frank haven hall ( superintendent of the illinois school for the blind ) , and was presented to the public in 1892 . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1951 david abraham , a wood ##working teacher at the perkins school for the blind produced a more advanced bra ##ille type ##writer , the perkins bra ##ille ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1991 ernest bat ##e developed the mount ##bat ##ten bra ##ille ##r , an electronic machine used to type bra ##ille on bra ##ille paper , giving it a number of additional features such as word processing , audio feedback and em ##bos ##sing . [SEP]
[CLS] this version was improved in 2008 with a quiet writer that had an erase key . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille printers or em ##bos ##ser were produced in 1950s . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1960 robert mann , a teacher in mit , wrote dots ##ys , a software that allowed automatic bra ##ille translation , and another group created an em ##bos ##sing device called " m . i . t . bra ##ille ##mbo ##ss . " . [SEP]
[CLS] the mit ##re corporation team of robert gil ##de ##a , jonathan mill ##en , reid ge ##rh ##art and joseph sullivan ( now president of du ##x ##bury systems ) developed dots ##ys iii , the first bra ##ille translator written in a portable programming language . [SEP]
[CLS] dots ##ys iii was developed for the atlanta public schools as a public domain program . [SEP]
[CLS] in 2011 david s . morgan produced the first smart bra ##ille ##r machine , with added text to speech function and allowed digital capture of data entered . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille is usually read in printed forms such as paper books written in bra ##ille , bra ##ille public signals and also on bra ##ille e - books . [SEP]
[CLS] currently more than 1 % of all printed books have been translated into bra ##ille . [SEP]
[CLS] although the finger can read only one bra ##ille character at a time , the brain chunks bra ##ille at a higher level , processing words a dig ##raph , root or suffix at a time . [SEP]
[CLS] the processing largely takes place in the visual cortex . [SEP]
[CLS] children who are blind not only have the educational disadvantage of not being able to see – they also miss out on fundamental parts of early and advanced education if not provided with the necessary tools . [SEP]
[CLS] children who are blind or visually impaired can begin learning pre - bra ##ille skills from a very young age to become fluent bra ##ille readers as they get older . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1960 , 50 % of legally blind , school - age children were able to read bra ##ille in the u . s . [SEP]
[CLS] according to the 2015 " annual report " from the american printing house for the blind , there were 61 , 73 ##9 legally blind students registered in the u . s . of these , 8 . 6 % ( 5 , 333 ) were registered as bra ##ille readers , 31 % ( 19 , 109 ) as visual readers , 9 . 4 % ( 5 , 79 ##5 ) as auditory readers , 17 % ( 10 , 470 ) as pre - readers , and 34 % ( 21 , 03 ##2 ) as non - readers . [SEP]
[CLS] there are numerous causes for the decline in bra ##ille usage , including school budget constraints , technology advancement ##s such as screen - reader software , and different philosophical views over how blind children should be educated . [SEP]
[CLS] a key turning point for bra ##ille literacy was the passage of the rehabilitation act of 1973 , an act of congress that moved thousands of children from specialized schools for the blind into mainstream public schools . [SEP]
[CLS] because only a small percentage of public schools could afford to train and hire bra ##ille - qualified teachers , bra ##ille literacy has declined since the law took effect . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille literacy rates have improved slightly since the bill was passed , in part because of pressure from consumers and advocacy groups that has led 27 states to pass legislation man ##dating that children who are legally blind be given the opportunity to learn bra ##ille . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1998 there were 57 , 425 legally blind students registered in the united states , but only 10 % ( 5 , 46 ##1 ) of them used bra ##ille as their primary reading medium . [SEP]
[CLS] early bra ##ille education is crucial to literacy for a blind or low - vision child . [SEP]
[CLS] a study conducted in the state of washington found that people who learned bra ##ille at an early age did just as well , if not better than their sighted peers in several areas , including vocabulary and comprehension . [SEP]
[CLS] in the preliminary adult study , while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment , it was found that 44 % of the participants who had learned to read in bra ##ille were unemployed , compared to the 77 % unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print . [SEP]
[CLS] currently , among the estimated 85 , 000 blind adults in the united states , 90 % of those who are bra ##ille - liter ##ate are employed . [SEP]
[CLS] among adults who do not know bra ##ille , only 33 % are employed . [SEP]
[CLS] statistical ##ly , history has proven that bra ##ille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows blind or low - vision children to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment and later in life as they enter the workforce . [SEP]
[CLS] though bra ##ille is thought to be the main way blind people read and write , in britain ( for example ) out of the reported two million blind and low vision population , it is estimated that only around 15 , 000 – 20 , 000 people use bra ##ille . [SEP]
[CLS] younger people are turning to electronic text on computers with screen reader software instead , a more portable communication method that they can use with their friends . [SEP]
[CLS] a debate has started on how to make bra ##ille more attractive and for more teachers to be available to teach it . [SEP]
[CLS] although it is possible to trans ##cr ##ibe print by simply sub ##stituting the equivalent bra ##ille character for its printed equivalent , in english such a character - by - character transcription ( known as " un ##con ##tracted bra ##ille " ) is only used by begin ##ners . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille characters are much larger than their printed equivalent ##s , and the standard 11 " by 11 . 5 " ( 28 cm × 30 cm ) page has room for only 25 lines of 43 characters . [SEP]
[CLS] to reduce space and increase reading speed , most bra ##ille alphabet ##s and or ##th ##og ##raph ##ies use liga ##tures , abbreviation ##s , and contraction ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] virtually all english bra ##ille books are transcribed in this " contracted bra ##ille , " which adds an additional layer of complexity to english or ##th ##ography : the library of congress ' s " instruction manual for bra ##ille trans ##cr ##ib ##ing " runs to over 300 pages and bra ##ille trans ##cr ##ibe ##rs must pass certification tests . [SEP]
[CLS] fully contracted bra ##ille is known as " grade 2 bra ##ille " . [SEP]
[CLS] there is an intermediate form , called grade 1 bra ##ille , that is between computer bra ##ille ( one - for - one identity with print ) and grade 2 bra ##ille . [SEP]
[CLS] in grade 1 bra ##ille , the capital sign and number sign are used , and most pun ##ct ##uation marks are shown using their grade 2 values . [SEP]
[CLS] the system of contraction ##s in english bra ##ille begins with a set of 23 words which are contracted to single characters . [SEP]
[CLS] thus the word " but " is contracted to the single letter " b , " " can " to " c " , " do " to " d " , and so on . [SEP]
[CLS] even this simple rule creates issues requiring special cases ; for example , " d " is , specifically , an abbreviation of the verb " do ; " the noun " do " representing the note of the musical scale is a different word , and must be spelled out . [SEP]
[CLS] portions of words may be contracted , and many rules govern this process . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the character with dots 2 - 3 - 5 ( the letter " f " lowered in the bra ##ille cell ) stands for " ff " when used in the middle of a word . [SEP]
[CLS] at the beginning of a word , this same character stands for the word " to " ; the character is written in bra ##ille with no space following it . [SEP]
[CLS] ( this contraction was removed in the unified english bra ##ille code . ) [SEP]
[CLS] at the end of a word , the same character represents an ex ##cl ##ama ##tion point . [SEP]
[CLS] some contraction ##s are more similar than their print equivalent ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] for example , the contraction ⟨ l ##r ⟩ , meaning ' letter ' , differs from ⟨ ll ⟩ , meaning ' little ' , only by one dot in the second letter : " little " , " letter " . [SEP]
[CLS] this causes greater confusion between the bra ##ille spelling ##s of these words and can hind ##er the learning process of contracted bra ##ille . [SEP]
[CLS] the contraction rules take into account the linguistic structure of the word ; thus , contraction ##s are generally not to be used when their use would alter the usual bra ##ille form of a base word to which a prefix or suffix has been added . [SEP]
[CLS] some portions of the transcription rules are not fully cod ##ified and rely on the judgment of the trans ##cr ##ibe ##r . [SEP]
[CLS] thus , when the contraction rules permit the same word in more than one way , preference is given to " the contraction that more nearly approximate ##s correct pronunciation . " [SEP]
[CLS] " grade 3 bra ##ille " is a variety of non - standardized systems that include many additional short ##hand - like contraction ##s . [SEP]
[CLS] they are not used for publication , but by individuals for their personal convenience . [SEP]
[CLS] when people produce bra ##ille , this is called bra ##ille transcription . [SEP]
[CLS] when computer software produces bra ##ille , this is called bra ##ille translation . [SEP]
[CLS] bra ##ille translation software exists to handle most of the common languages of the world , and many technical areas , such as mathematics ( mathematical notation ) , for example wi ##mat ##s , music ( musical notation ) , and ta ##ct ##ile graphics . [SEP]
[CLS] since bra ##ille is one of the few writing systems where ta ##ct ##ile perception is used , as opposed to visual perception , a bra ##ille reader must develop new skills . [SEP]
[CLS] one skill important for bra ##ille readers is the ability to create smooth and even pressures when running one ' s fingers along the words . [SEP]
[CLS] there are many different styles and techniques used for the understanding and development of bra ##ille , even though a study by b . f . holland suggests that there is no specific technique that is superior to any other . [SEP]
[CLS] another study by lowe ##n ##field & abel shows that bra ##ille can be read " the fastest and best . . . by students who read using the index fingers of both hands " . [SEP]
[CLS] another important reading skill emphasized in this study is to finish reading the end of a line with the right hand and to find the beginning of the next line with the left hand simultaneously . [SEP]
[CLS] one final conclusion drawn by both lowe ##n ##field and abel is that children have difficulty using both hands independently where the right hand is the dominant hand . [SEP]
[CLS] but this hand preference does not co ##rre ##late to other activities . [SEP]
[CLS] when bra ##ille was first adapted to languages other than french , many schemes were adopted , including mapping the native alphabet to the alphabet ##ical order of french – e . g . in english w , which was not in the french alphabet at the time , is mapped to bra ##ille x , x to y , y to z , and z to the first french - accent ##ed letter – or completely rear ##rang ##ing the alphabet such that common letters are represented by the simplest bra ##ille patterns . [SEP]
[CLS] consequently , mutual intel ##li ##gi ##bility was greatly hind ##ered by this state of affairs . [SEP]
[CLS] in 1878 , the international congress on work for the blind , held in paris , proposed an international bra ##ille standard , where bra ##ille codes for different languages and scripts would be based , not on the order of a particular alphabet , but on phonetic correspondence and translit ##eration to latin . [SEP]
[CLS] this unified bra ##ille has been applied to the languages of india and africa , arabic , vietnamese , hebrew , russian , and armenian , as well as nearly all latin - script languages . [SEP]
[CLS] greek , for example , " gamma " is written as latin " g " , despite the fact that it has the alphabet ##ic position of " c " ; hebrew " bet " , the second letter of the alphabet and co ##gna ##te with the latin letter " b " , is sometimes pronounced / b / and sometimes / v / , and is written " b " or " v " accordingly ; russian " ts " is written as " c " , which is the usual letter for / ts / in those slavic languages that use the latin alphabet ; and arabic " f " is written as " f " , despite being historically " p " , and occurring in that part of the arabic alphabet ( between historic " o " and " q " ) . [SEP]
[CLS] other systems for assign ##ing values to bra ##ille patterns are also followed beside the simple mapping of the alphabet ##ical order onto the original french order . [SEP]
[CLS] some bra ##ille alphabet ##s start with unified bra ##ille , and then diver ##ge significantly based on the ph ##ono ##logy of the target languages , while others diver ##ge even further . [SEP]
[CLS] in the various chinese systems , traditional bra ##ille values are used for initial consonants and the simple vowels . [SEP]
[CLS] in both mandarin and cantonese bra ##ille , however , characters have different readings depending on whether they are placed in syllable - initial ( onset ) or syllable - final ( rim ##e ) position . [SEP]
[CLS] for instance , the cell for latin " k " , , represents cantonese " k " ( " g " in yale and other modern romani ##zation ##s ) when initial , but " aa ##k " when final , while latin " j " , , represents cantonese initial " j " but final " o ##ei " . [SEP]
[CLS] novel systems of bra ##ille mapping include korean , which adopt ##s separate syllable - initial and syllable - final forms for its consonants , explicitly grouping bra ##ille cells into sy ##lla ##bic groups in the same way as hangul . [SEP]
[CLS] japanese , meanwhile , combines independent vowel dot patterns and mod ##ifier consonant dot patterns into a single bra ##ille cell – an abu ##gi ##da representation of each japanese mora . [SEP]
[CLS] the current series of canadian bank ##notes has a ta ##ct ##ile feature consisting of raised dots that indicate the denomination , allowing bills to be easily identified by blind or low vision people . [SEP]
[CLS] it does not use standard bra ##ille ; rather , the feature uses a system developed in consultation with blind and low vision canadians after research indicated that bra ##ille was not sufficiently robust and that not all potential users read bra ##ille . [SEP]
[CLS] mexican bank notes , australian bank notes , indian ru ##pee notes , israeli new she ##kel notes and russian rub ##le notes also have special raised symbols to make them identifiable by persons who are blind or low vision . [SEP]
[CLS] in india there are instances where the parliament acts have been published in bra ##ille , such as " the right to information act " . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united states , the americans with disabilities act of 1990 requires various building signage to be in bra ##ille . [SEP]
[CLS] in the united kingdom , it is required that medicines have the name of the medicine in bra ##ille on the labeling . [SEP]
[CLS] australia also recently introduced the ta ##ct ##ile feature onto their five - dollar bank ##note [SEP]
[CLS] u . k . september 2017 – on the front of the £10 polymer note ( the side with raised print ) , there are two clusters of raised dots in the top left hand corner . [SEP]
[CLS] this ta ##ct ##ile feature helps blind and partially sighted people identify the value of the note . [SEP]
